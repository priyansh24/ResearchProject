Anxiety is so weird like wtf, I'm anxious about possibly being hit by a car that's 100 feet away because there's a slight chance it'll swerve/ lose control and hit me, but not feeling hungry anymore is just a meh, whatever"

I joined a coaching class earlier this year and was very excited to study for the entrance exam to get into few of the most prestigious MBA colleges in India (IIMs) but Covid ruined everything and I had to come back to my home (which is a 1,000 kms from mumbai). I couldn't prepare for the exam and now I'm lost. I don't know what to do. I tried applying for a company in the Placement Cell of my college and the interview didn't go that well so the college management kicked me out of the cell. It's been eating me since two months now. I can't focus on anything. I can't sleep properly. I don't feel good, I don't feel happy. Although I've always been good at academics, I feel like a failure. Can someone please help me?"

Every day little by little  I started writing lines, (also i am an Indian but i love making English songs) I love music, with the help of youtube tutorials i started making beats using FL , little by little everything added up. I started getting sleep at night used to wake up early just to make songs and vibe with myself. And then i made my first song yet i was unsure if i should share it with people or would they like it or not as i am from India will they like to listen to it or not. But i gathered my gut and made one of my friend to listen to it and she gave a very positive response and like that i started my music journey. And now when i look back i feel i still have those anxiety issues with me but now i have the strength to fight with it. There is always a way. Ive got much love from people throughout the world in my dance and music career both! And i feel blessed. Dont forget to thank God always. Its life its gon be tough! But you know deep inside what you can do just hold on to it. And the only thing you can do it. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. THE UNIVERSE WILL MAKE WAY FOR YOU!"

        "selftext": "I'm a 15-year-old who likes to do art, and I have a made-up country. The people who live there are entirely fictional, and I base their personalities on those of people I know or may have heard of (like celebrities), regardless of ethnicity. I give the major group of people here grey-skin because it has no comparison in real life and it won't offend anyone. Generally I try very hard to make sure this made-up country isn't a sick white-privilege escape fantasy, and to make sure I'm not being racist as I make it up. A fair amount influence for this land comes from the countries that my rather diverse heritage originates, specifically the places I have cultural connections to, not just ancestral. I look white, but my grandfather is not; he has dark skin and is from the far eastern islands of Greece, with Turkish and Middle-Eastern ancestry, and he doesn't consider himself white. On top of that one of my great-great-great grandmothers was black, from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India, though I have no cultural connection to this and I don't boast about it.Anyway, as for my art. My concern lies with my drawings of the people of my country, which are not black, white or anything real; they're just made up, unique humans from this fictional place, who act just like normal people and aren't supposed to be primitive or anything. But I have gotten super worried that some of these characters resemble blackface caricatures of black people, which is the absolute last thing I ever intended. Nobody has ever told me that my art is racist, but some people I've shown this art to have noted it resembles blackface, but assured me I wasn't doing anything wrong, and that they wouldn't have noticed so if the black lives matter protests were not ongoing. Personally, I am not just a non-racist, but an anti-racist; I am very educated on racism and solutions to fix it, understand structural racism, call out any racism I see, and I have been on BLM marches. If I do ever draw black people, I do it with the utmost respect and conscience, never wanting to contribute to the horrible racism they endure. But with this art, even if I haven't drawn many characters with this particularly dark shade of grey, or have any intentions of associating it with Africans or Blackface, still worries the shit out of me that it looks too racist for words. I can't figure out how to attach an image of the art to this post, but what do you think?"

        "selftext": "Hi again!I\u2019m Noreen Choudhri, clinical psychologist with 7+ years of experience (Owner &amp; Founder of Made in Mind,  Rajasthan, Jaipur, India )For my previous post ( on a different subreddit) I received so much of appreciation and response (also an award \ud83d\ude0a) which motivates me to do this.Based on the common complaints and strategies I have suggested people with mental health issues. I will be giving you one tip on a weekly basis that you can implement in your day to day life. Also try it for at least a week or 10 days consistently to see any improvements. It may work for some and may not work for others. Tip 1 STOP TRYING TO STOP OR CONTROL YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS It is not possible to stop or control your thoughts.A lot frustration stems from trying to control your thoughts.Thoughts  come and go. Trying to control what thoughts occur when, or trying to stop certain thoughts from happening altogether, is a poor use of your time and energy.Try this Experiment-  Try NOT to think of a PINK ELEPHANT, it actually makes it more likely that you will. It\u2019s called Ironic process theory, and refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface.What you can do or learn to do is accept that you can\u2019t control thoughts, develop the skill of observing mind-made activity (thought production) without getting caught up in it. With consistent practice, you\u2019ll discover for yourself that the content of your mind does not matter. What matters is how you let it affect you. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds floating across the sky: instead of getting lost in them, you can choose to watch them come and go."

        "selftext": "I wanted to know if the following has been everyone\u2019s experience and should keep working on it or should I use the anti-depressants my doctor prescribed me for Depression/Anxiety to help me further - Lexapro 10mgI think I have social anxiety, I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety after a day long evaluation and tests, this is what I feel in certain situations:Parties - Going AloneBefore the Event:Before going to the party/social event I would sign up get excited but right when the moment arrives when I have to show up my mind gets filled with thoughts like - Should I go? Who would I talk to? What would I talk about? And then keep making sure I look good multiple times? Etc.During the Event:and finally when I do show up after wasting some time, I see all the people in events being in groups, I won\u2019t know how to approach the group and due to the fear of looking awkward standing alone, I quickly run to the food section, etc trying to look busy and then slowly start with finding smaller groups or people from my same race (Originally from India), because it\u2019s easier to connect with them about something. The conversation:I tend to stick to the usual boring questions which even bores the shit out of me, about work, location, and other boring small talk. After I\u2019m done with smaller groups and my nerves are eased I try to approach bigger groups, this is what happens when I do that - I introduce myself, and asking some boring small talk shit out of context when the others are clearly already in a different conversation, then try to listen to what they are talking about while my mind is internally racing thinking listen to what they are talking, say something, say something, say something and then I just hang around in the group smiling, nodding and boring myself and not even being sure how to exit the group, so I just stand there doing this for a long time, by this time I\u2019m standing there awkwardly and not even concentrating on the conversation.After the event:I feel very stupid and angry that I was not able to connect with anyone and had to go through that dreadful couple of hours and then start to get depressed about my social skills. Growing up I have always been quite shy, mostly had small limited group of friends, met my ex girlfriend through college in the same class, etc. I have been trying to work on my social skills and these are some of the things I have been doing which I think are helping:- Pushing myself to talk to random strangers - Either compliments, questions, and then trying to make some small talk- Trying new things like Karaoke, my hands and body were literally shaking on the stage, I just held on to the mic with all my power in order to control the shaking and not look stupid. I usually get these shakes during beginning of interview, verbal confrontation with someone, talk in front of a class.- Bodybuilding, cardio and healthy diet - this has been making me feel more happy and confident - One thing I definitely realize now is I tend to think people are looking at me, judging me or laughing at me,  but in reality no one gives a fuck about my mistakes, etc. I\u2019m trying to work on this as well and Maybe I also need to work on some self esteem issues?All the above have definitely been helping with the nerves as I can notice I\u2019m definitely more willing to jump into an anxious Situation/take action now, while still learning the basics of social situations, conversations, social awareness, body language etc. Should I continue to do this or start the medication as well? Anyone who had similar problems, how did you overcome them?"

        "selftext": "I, 24, M from India, single for all 24 years, am a happy fun loving introvert, who travels a lot, loves and treats my car and my bike as if they were my family, who came from a family of lower middle class now owns and runs a startup and quite frankly had a happy life(well, most of it) untill June 21st 2020 which is when I decided to commit suicide because I couldn't ignore the fact that my life will be miserable forever, becausing I am hiding the pain underneath the happy face and was afraid of relationships because I witnessed in first hand, what a failed marriage could do. My parents fight, just like any other family, but they are doing it from way long before I was born. And one fine day I had enough of it, there was a big fight that day and I decided that I will kill myself, but failed to do so because I met a girl. (How dramatic? Ikr!)We became instant friends, and she was the only reason I couldn't proceed. I moved out of my home for a month and was wandering in all the permitted places sleeping in my car, etc., it was still lockdown back then. And we used to communicate thru insta and whatsapp and we kinda grew close, atleast I did. And slowly I fell for her, in my defence I wasn't exactly thinking at that moment. Days passed by and she started to text less all of a sudden but she would ask me for help if she ever needed it, other than that she wouldn't reply for a text for 3 days but would talk with me for 5 hours the day after. So, it was impossible for me to decide to move on or to know what's going on. Also, she was the only string that stopped me from committing again. And after three months as it turns out I asked her out and she straight out rejected as it would never ever happen. She made that clear. I tried to be friends with her, she was okay with it, but she didn't reply at all for most days which started some serious anxiety issues and depression and so, I tried to move on. It's been 2 months and I can't sleep because as soon as I close my eyes the thought train would go back to her I can't watch movies and tv series, because every actress reminds me of her, I couldn't browse instagram, I couldn't talk to people, So I uninstalled all social media apps except for reddit, honestly I could never go back to my normal life. I mean, am not madly in love with her or anything. I mean, I don't know, I could be, it was a weak moment when I fell for her, I was never this stupid in my life, this is the first time I am experiencing this feeling, to wanting someone who doesn't want me. Honestly tho, there is a lot more to story, it turned out that she was only using me but I won't tell that part of the story, so I really don't want her back in my life. But I still can't stop thinking about her.And today I came out for a drive and I saw someone who looks a bit like her on the road and I suddenly have anxiety building up and an elevated heart rate, and I couldn't drive anymore. I stopped the car and just drank some water, and I saw some other girl crossing the road I have the elevated heart rate again and this happened with everyone I saw on the road, I freaked out and came back home.This could be the stupidest thing you ever read, I would feel the same way. But, I really don't know what else to do, I tried to talk with 2 of my friends and they both freaked out so I quickly changed the subject. Anyone ever felt this way? What should I do? I can't stay indoors forever neither can I completely stop looking at a complete gender."

I'm scared the room won't be sound-proof, so anyone outside can hear the conversation. Will all my details be kept totally confidential?2. Do the doctor always prescribe medicines?

I never called her after 5-6 months of our break-up. I mean, I was calling her for 5-6 months after our break-up because I didn't want to let her go. But I stopped calling her after that since I knew that she is not going to come back and I ought to move on. But she used to call me sporadically after one year of our break-up(5-6 times a year). She was also dating a guy after our breakup but her boyfriend wasn't aware of the fact that she sporadically calls me. One thing was common whenever she called me; she bitched about her boyfriend. And I never hung up on her because I didn't want to hurt her so I listened to her whining about her romance. Now, during Covid19 lockdown she broke up with her boyfriend(she told me that). And we are in the same city now and suddenly her calls and texts are coming almost daily. I mean I ignore her texts by replying late and sometimes leaving her on seen but she still manages to find a way to talk to me. And I talk to her because I don't want to hurt her. When I leave her on seen she asks me if I think that she is only talking to me because she doesn't have a boyfriend. And out of kindness I say that I don't. One thing which I would like to mention is that when she had a boyfriend she didn't like me calling her and was very explicit about it. One day I drunk called her when she had a boyfriend a she explicitly asked me to not to call/text her.  Now, I have 2 problems -First, that I don't wanna hurt her but want to tell her In a polite way that I don't want to talk to her and since I care about her I can't be blatant about this.Second, she is preparing for some examination and she is working hard for it. And most of our conversation nowadays is about studies since I'm also preparing for public service examination. So the problem is when she can't score good in mock tests she calls me and tells me things like she feels like killing herself. And I'm a very anxious person and this exacerbates my anxiety and I start thinking about things like what if she really does that. Would I be charged for abetment because I am taking to her. Now, I know that this will be no case of abetment even if God forbid she does that. But since I live in India I still want to play safe and don't want to go through any legal process since that could be tedious and heavy on my pockets. And this is also why I don't want to talk to her because I don't know if she says those things casually or she means them. Please help!"

I am embarrassed but I don\u2019t want my anxiety to feed on it because I already have low self-esteem and other things I am dealing with. I also feel like in my last year of college I should be over these things by now. Such situations always see me spiralling down instead of being motivated to do better.

It seemed friendly and got off after a minute. While he was on me I felt a little pick at my skin. IDK i it was a scratch, a bite, or if he was just grooming. I immediately went to the ER hospital for suspicion of rabies next to where Im staying to get checked out. The ER doctor said I was fine and checked my neck and back. My friend said he didnt see anything on my back and my preceptor for my India Pharmacy rotation said he didnt see anything and told me that it mostly comes from dogs in this area. Im still anxious as all hell and the ER doctor told me that she could give it if she wanted me to but she didnt recommend it. Its been almost 24 hours so Im still anxious as hell after going through the internet. I do suffer from anxiety but nothing diagnosised yet. I plan to go to counseling when I get back. I worry about every little thing"

Anybody with experience taking it over a long period of time?..ASHWAGANDHA: NATURE\u2019S GIFT FOR ANXIETYAshwagandha is probably one of the most popular and prescribed herbal medicines at the Holistic Medical Centre, by our doctors and naturopaths alike. As a result, we thought this wonderful herb deserved a special introduction of its own.Also commonly known as Withania, ashwagandha is a herb native to India, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. It has been prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners for thousands of years and has many studies supporting its safety and efficacy. Traditionally, the herb has been used to support convalescence after a period of illness. However, its ability to reduce anxiety symptoms, boost mood and strengthen the body against stress and fatigue has made it a valuable tool for combatting these common ailments of modern society.Through supporting adrenal performance, calming the nervous system, and enhancing immunity and brain function, ashwagandha has an excellent all round ability to support individuals through prolonged stressful periods that all too often result in further health disturbances. As a result, the herb has become a firm favourite in our practice for helping our patients to cope with stress and anxiety, as well as reducing associated symptoms such as mood and sleep disturbances, heart palpitations, feelings of overwhelm, and heightened sensitivity to stimulation.Preliminary trials have found ashwagandha to be as effective as some prescription anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs. Additionally, it has been shown to lower the production of the stress hormone cortisol which is often elevated in stressed individuals (on the flip side, it can also increase cortisol in people with low levels of this hormone). It is thought to exert many of its calming effects affects via stimulation of GABA activity \u2013 a natural hormone produced by our bodies to calm and relax us.As with many herbs, ashwagandha has numerous beneficial therapeutic actions that make it an excellent medicinal herb to use for the many conditions associated with or exacerbated by, anxiety, these include:Reducing anxiety and calming the nervous systemProtecting against the effects of stressImproving sleep qualityEnhancing learning and memoryIncreasing libido in men and womenSupporting convalescence after illnessEnhancing immune functionHelping ease inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and painful jointsSo you can see why we find this herb so beneficial in our practice!"

        "selftext": "I've suffered from anxiety for most of my life, however for the last ten years it's been pretty much okay. Then something happened a year ago that sent me into this tailspin that feels like it will never end. My husband and I were fortunate enough to live and travel abroad for ten years. We lived in Taiwan, the UAE, Panama, and Mexico. We traveled to other countries like India, Russia, Egypt, and many countries in Europe. Then in 2016 we bought a camper and drove from California to the southernmost point in Argentina. That took almost three years. One might think that all the uncertainty surrounding travel would induce anxiety but for me it made it easier. I had to get out of my head and solve problems and challenges every day. Language barriers, complicated border crossings, and all the other aspects of travel made me feel more in control and able to let go of the things I couldn't control. Plus, not being in the States was always a relief. Right before the end of our Pan Am Highway trip we received news that my mother in law was very ill with dementia and my husband (only child) felt we needed to return home to Hawaii to help. I was devastated because we had planned to ship the camper to Europe and continue traveling but of course I understood. So we sold the camper and moved back to Hawaii a year ago today. When we were getting on the plane in Santiago, Chile I told my husband, \"What if something happens and we can never leave again?\" Famous last words. So when we got to Hawaii I realized that neither my husband nor my father in law were prepared or capable to handle all of the things that come with end of life care. I took on everything. My mother in law died peacefully just before Christmas last year. My husband and I talked about leaving and going back to Mexico but he felt we should wait a few months to make sure his dad was going to be okay. Then COVID happened and the realization that the entire world is probably off limits to us. My anxiety surrounding caregiving was intense but now that I'm almost literally trapped on an island I'm having panic attacks almost daily. I work with a therapist and am medicated but every day I feel worse and worse. I can barely eat, I'm super jumpy all the time, and sleep rarely happens. I've never felt like this before. Every day feels like it could be the end of the world. And I ask myself, is this really how it's going to end?Thanks for reading."

Nevertheless, I understand even a war between Iran and the US wouldn\u2019t impact me definitively but the fear of escalation is still tingling me even after the initial shock.I feel like I felt when I heard about the India/Pakistan news a couple months ago. The same feeling of when WW3 was trending on twitter a couple years ago. Knowing those have not led to the wars that people perhaps fear-mongered about is some respite from the aftermath of the panic.Don\u2019t know if I\u2019m looking for people to tell me it\u2019s alright, telling me the straight truth or telling me a white lie to feel better (what I think my dad does at times, or others in other posts).The rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, I\u2019ll be worrying about it twice.

I have a 16 y/o sister, whom i really love and care about. From last 1.5 year, she has been in a relationship with a boy who is 1 year older than me. My mother knows about this relationship, and she had no option, but to support it. My father, however, is completely unaware of this, and thinks that his daughter is very \"good\" in that sense. Both my father and my sister's boyfriend are complete bigots and full on narcissists. If my father got cognizant of the hidden relationship, he will do things, that even upon thinking, i hyperventilate and get anxious. On the other hand, my sister's bf constantly blackmails her into keeping up the relationship, that she is now REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN. However, i don't think that he blackmails for other more private stuff.  The basis of his blackmail is that he will tell my father about the whole relationship thing. Which, consequently, will make us all (me, my mother, my sister) liars in his eyes, which is BAD, SERIOUSLY BAD. My anxiety is crippling me, i am all the time tired, no motivations and no will to fight. It's like i am imploding, not exploding: i don't cry at all, i just sit and my body feels like it's getting more and more hollow. We run a pharmaceutical business, so after some research, i self prescribed a dose of pregabalin to reduce anxiety, without the need of acquiring a prescription. I have been taking it for like 5 days and it is showing lil effects. In January, most probably, her bf will go to Canada for study purposes, which will subside this whole mess. As of now, he has made attempts to call my father to tell him about all that, but he never said anything on phone, and just hanged up the call. There are less chances of him actually calling my father, cos he knows that it will certainly end the relationship. My sister is not at all interested in the relationship. She never ever complaints thought, thinking that it would make my mother and me anxious. She is very brave. Truly. My mother, who has suffered all her life from my ass father, also gets anxious and worried about the future. She also suffers from migraines, so more stress causes real bad headaches. Both of them are very brave and they are fighting for what could happen. But, I am not, I get super scared and anxious when all this happens. I don't know how to normalize, and feel ok. It's like eating me. Sometimes i think of real bad stuff happening to both the bigots, and sometimes i feel as cuffed and restrained. I know it's not life and death matter, but it's certainly not comfortable also. There is this fear that always lingers, about what would happen. Sorry, if this situation is not worthy of being with all of the other horrible situations, that people here go through."

Sometimes i just feel i should ask her out on Instagram...but then what if she doesn't care to reply even there...My friends don't bother to talk to a loser like me and the ones that did said I shouldn't ask her out right away but chat with her, build her trust and then drop the bomb on her but how the fuck am I supposed to get an opening...!!!??What if she did want me to make a move on her??I don't want to regret this later on ..I'll never find someone again,  I've  never had love in my life , never had a girlfriend ,what if this is the story of my life?? I want her to be the one, I don't want to marry some girl just because my family wants me to settle down and have kids..I want to marry for love....I've already lost much of my time due to my anxious self and procastination and am losing more and my mind over this girl...this is definitely not love but obsession and it's toxic and unforgiving ...Oh fuck I also have to get a Job really soon..!!!sorry this is so long .. ...I have no one to talk to ..."

Actually, for two years, I was working for a competitive exam but I didn't get the college I wanted. Suddenly, when I joined college I think my life lost all purpose and I just didn't know what to do. I just felt anxious all the time like I had no purpose at all in life.This anxiety has ruined so many decisions in my life. I passed out of my college last year. I got a job actually. But, well I didn't know whether I should take it or not since it was not a great job and I was anxious whether I'd get stuck in that job or that I may lose my chance to take a Master's abroad even though I didn't like the subject. So, I didn't take that job.I thought I'd change the subject for Master's and thought of applying for Math. But, we don't get jobs in our country (India) just after a master's and I would have to take another Master's degree in a reputed university abroad. It seemed to be too far-fetched. But, my father persuaded me by saying that I'm intelligent and it would do me good to try it.But, at the same time, now a Master's abroad in engg which I hated suddenly seemed so much better than this slim-chance deal. So, I applied for that as well.Now, I got a Master's abroad and the reality struck again. I know this isn't what I want to do and I feel helpless because I had hated it all through my Bachelor's and again I'm going for Master's.I mean there's a lot of background, I don't know what all to include.If anyone's got doubts or suggestions (not some empty stuff like suck it up and all because it's not a one-time thing, I'm tired of sucking it up all the time), it would be great.I mean I just want this anxiety and restlessness to go."

I was depressed for  3 years and now regained some strength to learn on my own to become a software developer and to get a job in a top tech company.

I am always thinking about quitting and can't proceed any further its been 3 days since I touched my laptop But I have this guilt feeling in me, it is killing me. I have learned a lot from this platform and even though I know what I had to do, I am always stopping myself from doing it. I am afraid if I would fail in this too!Ps: i am the first graduate of my family and my parents joined me in this course just for job prospects. I'm really stressed out because I am 2021 grad and I will have college job fair in few months!"

I need some hope ...I have nowhere to go, so I am here randomly venting and on the verge of a breakdown . I am from India and I went to China to study mbbs and graduated with a degree in 2017. The problem is my high school certificate, I failed in 12th grade coz I was busy chasing girls and having fun with friends and looking for shortcuts, but I was smart with regards to study, atleast that\u2019s what my parents think, they wanted me to be a doctor....so In order to pursue a career in medicine I dropped out and redid 12th grade from an open school with biology from some other province, on my uncles advice, it was some shortcut and I didn\u2019t even have to write the exams myself but I got high school certificates and I applied to study medicine and got accepted by some university in chine. Fast forward to 2017 I graduate and come back to India and went to register myself for the board exam and they ask me for all the certificates and  I provided them and this is where my life changed, they tell me the high school board I obtained my 12 grade certificate is not recognised and I can\u2019t register. It\u2019s been three years since and I have been trying to sort this problem out with whatever means possible, spent all I had on ways to procure a legit marksheet, I went deepweb and whatever corrupt contacts I had but I have only found failure. I have been severely depressed and get anxious whenever I think this, which is all the time and I feel hopeless. I have wanted to be a doctor so bad in my life but now I am nothing I can\u2019t have career and I am in despair. I have been told that if I go abroad I won\u2019t really need a high school certificate they will only seek my graduation degree and stuff, so I tried to talk to ppl experienced doctor on social media and everywhere I can and they all told me it\u2019s not possible, you can\u2019t do anything without a high school certificate and it has to be legit... and I should give up on this, I will be happy and I should some other career which doesn\u2019t need high school n blah blah blah...it not possible for me to have a career without a legit high school certificate. My mbbs degree is verified and legit and I have worked hard to earn that, but it worth shit without high school certificate... I can\u2019t think and I can\u2019t stop thinking all that\u2019s lost, I can\u2019t get over the fact that it\u2019s over and I can\u2019t even mourn the death of my dreams, i day dream about suicide all the time and it seems the only way to make this feeling and the thoughts in my head stop.

        "selftext": "I've suffered from anxiety for a long time, but have been formally diagnosed with GAD about 2 years ago.27/F and I've always had a very nervous disposition \\- even to the point where my family and teachers used to call me the safety police because I couldn't let anyone do things that I deemed unsafe. In hindsight, those were totally unrealistic standards to set \\(things like not allowing my 6 year old sister go down the stairs without holding my hand\\). Either way, I started seeing my GP for my anxiety about 2 years ago and was finally actually diagnosed, so he started me on Citalopram. I came back from a 2 week long trip to India and was feeling really good, but I brought back a parasite and that did not go over well. I had the biggest panic attack of my life, and my irrational fears got worse \\- I couldn't stop thinking of my SO getting hurt, my grandfather or parents getting hurt or dying, or of something terrible happening to those I care about.My doctor was hesitant to up my dosage of Citalopram, and I really wanted to find a way to not rely on pharmaceuticals to eliminate my anxiety. He recommended acupuncture \\[side note \\- acupuncture has forced me to relax while I'm there, it's a great therapy, but it's only temporary\\] and a weighted blanket.I purchased one \\(Gravid, 15lbs\\) shortly after and as soon as I got it, I was a little disappointed.I could sit under it and it was cozy, yes, but I didn't feel inherently more calm or relaxed.Fast forward to the next couple mornings where I kept waking up... refreshed? It was more that I noticed I wasn't dragging my feet in the morning as much, and my anxiety was lessening every day. The more I slept under it, the more I found I would sleep through the night, my nightmares were dramatically reduced and I just felt better.Now, I don't find I spiral out of control. If I have a scary thought or one of my fears pops into my head \\(which still happens multiple times a day\\) I can very easily identify it as irrational and use breathing techniques and even internal mantras to calm myself. I think that good night's sleep \\(in a chain, especially!\\) has changed my level of anxiety and better prepared me for the day to deal with the anxiety that is inevitably a part of me.TL:DR \\- I was struggling with anxiety on pharmaceutical treatments and wanted to quit the drug, my weighted blanket makes me sleep much more efficiently and I wake up refreshed enough to better cope with my anxiety throughout the day. If you're thinking of getting one, please try it! Many companies offer a full money back guarantee within a couple weeks if it's not working for you. I know they're expensive but they're an investment in your mental health, and they work out to be a lot cheaper than even a few months of medications!"

First off this is not my main account but it is also not a throwaway even though it's new. I, for reasons of my anxiety, struggle to post on my main account and this is yet a further attempt to pull myself out of my head. I want to be better, as the title suggests, but I don't really know where to begin. I have suffered from depression and anxiety for the majority of my life, and while I have comparatively had an easier time of it than some others, it has left some serious marks on my life. I want to change to this, however, but this is where things get complicated for me. As previously stated I live in the northwest US, my area is fairly liberal, this is usually not a problem for me because I keep to myself and try to make myself seem as small as possible, but this is no longer really a possibility for me.For me to continue on the path I am on will only lead to my death, whether intentionally or otherwise, so I had decided on a path of change that i felt lined up with my own values and a variant of my style. I was going to be a \"Gentlemen\" in the best definition I could find (respectful to everyone, suave and debonair, comfortably confident). Now if you're reading this thinking that there's nothing wrong with any of that I would normally agree with you, but here is where my brain decides to intervene. As previously stated I am a white male, in the vast majority of scenarios that play out in my mind I cannot see it as ending well. If I dress in a suit or similar I am suddenly the problem in perpetuating the class divide, if I am confident then I must be self-absorbed, if I try and be traditionally respectful I am sexist etc. I already try and embody the last aspect of being respectful to everyone (holding doors, being as polite and patient as possible when being a customer, etc.) But even then I can't escape the feeling that I am just a horrible person pretending to be better, that I am seeking to rise above my worth...I understand that the majority of these problems stem from my inability to get out of my head so-to-speak, conversely, these problems aren't exactly the type of thing that spawns from nothing. To make matters worse, there is literally nothing I can do to solve several of them because they are predicated on how others perceive me out of context. I was on medication for a while but it had stopped helping and events conspired to leave me without the means to pursue therapy (admittedly the events were the fault of choices I made that I thought were right at the time but that's another story for another time.) I didn't really know the best sub to post this to, if this is the wrong one, I'll delete it. Tl;Dr: Want to improve myself but feel that I can't, \u001bbecause as a white male I feel that anything I do will be construed in a way that will make me seem like a villain when I just want to be a good person."

So now that I'm in India I'm on much higher alert and it's getting to be too much to handle. I'm completely terrified of getting ill(I know getting ill here is inevitable to a certain degree, but I'm worried about getting seriously ill) so I'm analyzing absolutely everything about my body, from marks on my skin to how I'm feeling. For example, the panic attacks today have been over 3 main things(feel free to provide information if you know anything about these): I got what seems to be a mosquito bite on the bottom of my foot, not sure how that happened. It was itchy for a little bit, it was red and raised like a normal bite, but now it's not itchy and it's a weird color/shape. Number 2 is over the fact that my armpits are having some kind of occasional sharp/stinging pain and I have no idea why. Number 3 is a mixture of things. When we were flying into Delhi, as part of their announcement they said to do something, I can't remember what, if you have recently been to Saudi Arabia and/or South Korea and are having trouble breathing or feeling generally ill. Considering the flight was Emirates, its pretty likely at least a few people who had been to Saudi Arabia recently were on that plane. I have no idea what illness they were referencing when they said that and I don't even want to look it up because I know it will drive me into a panic. The thing is, I DO feel short of breath and I have a cough that I developed when I woke up from a nap the day I arrived. Granted, Delhi is facing some of the worst pollution ever here(just google \"Delhi\" and it should come up) so it could also be that, I just don't know. And for healthcare, the options are significantly lesser than that of the United States. Specifically the city I come from in the US has many world renowned hospitals, so if I get sick there it seems to be relatively no big deal compared to here where it feels much more up in the air. I've had so many panic attacks about getting sick and dying here even far before I left the US. So how do I calm my nerves here? It's currently draining me of so much of my energy and combine that with the fact that this is my first time out of the country and India is so insanely different from the US, I just feel so exhausted constantly(I'm also super sleep deprived) and I want it to just stop but I'm analyzing everything about myself. Also, does anyone know anything about the medical stuff I mentioned earlier?"

The second she walked in the door she just said \"oh my god\" and kept repeating it over and over again.

        "selftext": "Okay, this is going to seem a bit odd but stick with me. I am by NO MEANS encouraging any substance abuse and just wanted to clarify that before I continued with my post. I got really, really drunk three nights ago. I blacked out for four hours and apparently for those whole four hours I was just crying, throwing up, and using the restroom while my boyfriend cleaned up for me. I slept the entire next day as I had a BANGER of a migraine. I hadn\u2019t eaten much the day before, which probably attributed heavily to my drunken night, but that\u2019s besides the point. I hadn\u2019t eaten much in three months anyways. I have had horrible, suffocating health anxiety that had begun to build in April. By the end of May I had begun to have an intense fear that my food was laced with psychoactive drugs or poison. One of the two. Maybe both if the fictitious, evil workers of Taco Bell in my head were feeling EXTRA feisty. Suffice to say, I didn\u2019t trust food. At all. I got lucky that I still trusted my liquids. I only lost 7 pounds throughout this but now I\u2019m severely underweight. Not, nutrient deprived as I had my blood work done shortly after this, but enough that my legs don\u2019t touch and my hip bones are bruised if I land on the bed wrong. Oh yeah, and I\u2019m fucking freezing. All. The. Time. I live in AZ and it\u2019s 114 outside, but guess what I\u2019m wearing? A thick knitted sweater and black skinny jeans with boots. And I\u2019m still cold. Anyways, I\u2019ve gone on a tangent. I\u2019m obviously not happy with the weight loss I\u2019ve endured the past year, and especially not the past couple months. So basically, I would force myself to eat, get horrified after one bite, continue eating, and only finish 1/4 of my meal. I\u2019d push it away, say I\u2019m full, and save it for later. Saving it for later was so if I am not going balls to the wall HIGH in an hour, then maybe I\u2019ll eat it. Probably not though, because OBVIOUSLY that taco bell worker only put the LSD on the LEFT side of my taco and I\u2019ve only eaten the right side. These TB workers are creative, guys. This was my head for literally the past three months. Every single day. I\u2019d say on average I probably had barely 500 calories from food in a day. Thankfully for me, I had stopped drinking diet soda shortly before this so I still received a shit ton of sugary calories everyday from liquid sources. So anyways, back to my hangover. By the time my boyfriend dropped me off at my parents house, migraine still raging, I was FAMISHED. But I put off eating because it\u2019d probably make me nauseous and I don\u2019t want to be anxious AND in pain. But lo and behold. After three months of constant agony around food, it was just gone. It left as quick as it had arrived. I ate so much food that night. I ate until my stomach was stretched as far as it could go, and then eat some more two hours later. I spent the whole night eating. Just anything I could get my hands on that seemed moderately healthy. I was so happy. My favorite thing used to be my weekly visit to chipotle. Now I can FINALLY enjoy my weekly visit again. I don\u2019t have to have fake chipotle workers snickering in my head about how much drugs they put in my sour cream or the poison they seasoned the sofritas with. It\u2019s only been a couple days but I\u2019m so happy. My boyfriend has been making me food everyday throughout this whole ordeal. I\u2019m so happy to GENUINELY mean it when I say, \u201cthank you, I really enjoyed it\u201d at the end of the meal he made for me. Those potato and egg burritos this morning were SO DAMN GOOD and it was because they stopped being sprinkled with anxiety. I still have some health anxiety. But after I had my corneas checked for a tear and an MRI and EEG done on a brain turmor I was CONVINCED of, it\u2019s just about the small stuff now. I have to avoid the health section of the news app because it always triggers me. Obviously that man in India that died of a bacterial infection means I WILL die of it too. But I can eat now. And for that, I\u2019m happy. I don\u2019t know what the alcohol did to me or if something in my brain just snapped but I\u2019m perfectly fine with it."

        "selftext": "I'm 24, from India.I'm not clinically diagnosed as having anxiety. But I believe I have higher anxiety than most people.I used to be very afraid and anxious right from my childhood days. Never went after girls due to my fear. In college, I liked a girl but never told her. She also had feelings towards me. Once she said this through a text message. But as my self esteem was very low and inferiority complex high, I thought she was lying. I thought she was trying to fool me just to see my reaction. I kept on telling her that I know that she is fooling me. Four months later after my course got over, once we were chatting and she again said that she likes me. This time I said that I too love her, only because the course was over and I wouldn't be seeing her everyday. After saying that I like her, I came to know that she indeed was telling the truth. I got very happy but at the same time I was kind of desperate. It was the first time someone was saying that they romantically like me. I regret not saying that I love her the first time she said it to me.We talked and chatted mostly. Then I went to another city to pursue my master's and she did her masters course only nearby. We started the relationship only after I got admission into the far away college. We again talked and chatted.But whenever I see her, I get all anxious. She is of a different religion and I am from a different one. I was afraid if our parents would agree. Besides whatever few times we saw each other in person, I was tensed to even hold her hand and walk in public. I felt people would notice me and maybe stare me. I didn't know what to do if someone passed some lewd comments.After two years, both of us completed our masters and she asked me to do a B.Ed (Bachelor of Education) course with her. But I was scared to teach. The thought of standing before children or college students to teach scares me. I said that I won't be doing as I am not interested in it. But actually I was more afraid to teach than being uninterested in teaching. Besides there were some moves done by her parents to get her married, which did not really materialise. I am unemployed and afraid to go to her home asking for bride. That's like a very big anxiety for meShe went forward with the course and some of our classmates from our degree course too were with her for this course. Now, after two years, the course is almost over and I regret not joining it. It's almost like our degree course. Few common friends, and the whole class went to the same place for the class tour which we went during our degree time. At that degree time, we were not in a relationship.Now I regret the decision of not joing B.Ed. I could have been with her for two years. I was too afraid to go for teaching. There was also the thought that going for teaching course would be something like going down. Like, after masters I thought people would go for M.Phil or Ph.D. Stupid thought. I should've chosen to be with her.Now few days before she said that discussions are going around for her marriage. It may happen this year. We have seen each other only like less than 20 times. I am too afraid to give some reasons to go out of my home to hang around with her. I actually seldom go out. No trips. Too afraid to do that.She said that she does not feel romantically interested in me anymore. She first thought I was a smart guy, due to my studying skills. I'm pretty good at studying. During our Masters time, we were like ok. We talked. But even at that time I tend to overthink about our relation and felt like I may not be able to marry her. This led to some temporary breaks in our relation. I used to say that talking too much can lead to problems. I may not be able to let go and shits like that.In the last two years when she was doing her B.Ed, I practically did nothing. For one year I sat at home. Tried developing  a blog, but it kind of flopped. Did not go for interviews as I was afraid. Besides I was addicted to porn and masturbation. I used to masturbate for like 3 hours daily. Edging.After one year I got a job on someone's recommendation. But it's a dead end one. It's a journalism job. I just have to type some news in, which I don't really like.Now she says I have been only talking about my problems for the past two years. Occassionally having breakdowns over the phone, crying like a baby. She says she is done with this. That she can't help me anymore. That I need to take care of my own. That I need to understand that everybody has problems and everybody is struggling. She said I take my problems to be special which is not true.I felt she said the truth. She has her own problems and she deals with it in her own ways. But I kind of get stuck when I get anxious and afraid. I don't do anything.Recently I have started changing. Started doing meditation and light exercise. Quit porn and masturbation. But still I am afraid and anxious about a lot of things. The thought of she getting married makes me sad. But at the same time I know that I can't take care of her right now. I first need to take care of myself.I sometimes go into regret mode and beat myself over not doing that course with her and over not saying my feelings to her when she said that she likes me, for the first time.How do I get out of this awful situation?"

He was some 18 year old guy from India I never expected to connect so deeply with. Fast forward 8 years and he's got an awesome job here in the States and we finally have the opportunity to meet up in Denver, CO (someplace both of us have been dying to visit) and vacation for a week. My anxiety has *always* gotten in the way of any relationship I've had of any kind, and this one has been no exception. What seems like the smallest things have given me the most anxiety throughout our 8 years of talking, from telling him my name, sending him a picture, talking on the phone, and skyping. The crazy thing is we had plans for me to fly out to where he lives in San Francisco back in March... and I cancelled a few weeks beforehand. I still feel absolutely horrible for doing that to him, but inspite of all of it, he still finds a way to be incredibly patient with me.  Now here we are, a month out from the first vacation I've had in years, my first time visiting a city I've been dying to see, and meeting one of my closest friends in person for the first time and for some reason, all I want to do is cry. Every detail has me questioning if this is going to be a disaster. **What if I miss my flight? What if the airport loses my luggage? What do I do when I see him for the first time? Should I hug him? What if he doesnt think I look as good as my pictures? What if we have nothing to talk about? We have one whole week together, what the hell are we gonna do in all that time? What if we have a horrible time and we never speak to each other again afterwards? What if we *really* end up liking each other? Does that mean we're going to start a relationship?**I'm so tired of letting my anxiety run the way I live. I just wish I could embrace and enjoy the excitement of all of this, but my mind always finds a way to distort it into something that's going to end terribly..."

        "selftext": "I\u2019m currently in a relationship of 2 months and at the moment she\u2019s away visiting family in India. I know she probably has things going on everyday, but short, abrupt responses and her rarely saying I love you if I don\u2019t say it first really gets to my head. To make matters worse, I don\u2019t really have anyone in my life as important as her and I know I\u2019ve definitely hurt her and made her impatient by revealing how I scrutinise over every little thing she does as a sign that she doesn\u2019t love me as much as I love her (I\u2019ve told her this fear of mine very explicitly). All of our conversations seem very substanceless to me and she never asks how my day is going or any of that, we only resort to very tense discussions or arguments about the issues I\u2019m describing.  Otherwise, she talks about things that happen in India or with her family - and to be fair she is extremely busy with get togethers and meetups. She is very comforting, but she doesn\u2019t initiate anything romantic or intimate on her own. We do it all over text too.She also gives me the silent treatment a lot if she is angry (and she is VERY emotional), and tends to take everything personally. She sucks at communication so I feel like I have to tread lightly with her. She has acknowledged she is unreasonable at times and that I should just give her \u20185 minutes\u2019 and she will be back to normal. But the problem is she completely switches back to normal, and doesn\u2019t bother trying to solve the problem beyond that, even if I have more to say. She just expects me to move on as quick as she does. I don\u2019t know how irrational it is, but this in addition to the fact that she is very experienced with relationships (which she says that none of them have been serious or as good as what we have now) and has had a past of being promiscuous with people while she was under the influence of alcohol, makes me think that she will move on from me just as quickly. I feel like I\u2019m very different to her, I am not a social person and I usually prioritise school over everything and only recently I\u2019ve made her among my top priorities. I feel like we might even be incompatible despite us having what we have. I have spoken to her about this and she assured me that she can\u2019t live without me and that I mean everything to her. Maybe that sounds too extreme to be true, which makes me think she said it just for me?I\u2019ve told her that sometimes I feel suicidal, and that I have had a traumatic relationship with my mother in childhood. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve over shared.I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about my anxiety except her and I know its such a burden. I am almost convinced she has completely lost interest in me, or doesn\u2019t see me the same way I see her. I feel like a lot of the romantic things she says or fantasies she comes up with about the future are for me, not because she genuinely means it. She has told me outright that she prioritises work and her parents over me, which made me lose a lot of sleep (although she has said on many occasions that she can\u2019t live without me). I have to wait another 6 weeks until we can meet again and I dread pouring my heart out to her because of the damage this has already done. She\u2019s very religious, and she says she has thanked god on many occasions for being lucky enough to have me, but that was before she left and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just her inability to express these things over text or her lack of time to do so that is the problem.I am also scared sick that she will cheat on me or leave me. I know she talks to other guy friends of mine, and I feel like I\u2019m being selfish or controlling. I know her history with other guys and I just wonder if she might be the type to cheat on me or just say things she doesn\u2019t actually mean. I think all this even though I know she has never cheated before. I also seem to make all the attempts at intimacy or being romantic. If I don\u2019t tell her how much she matters to me, then she won\u2019t do the same unprompted. I do it alot to, and I also talk about what I\u2019m feeling a fair amount but I\u2019m afraid of doing it anymore because I seem obsessed or I might hurt or bore her. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what she really sees in me. She\u2019s been with a lot of guys before and constantly reassures me that I\u2019m the best she\u2019s ever had and she wants a future with me, but what if she says that just because she knows I have anxiety? What if I am just a boring person, and she\u2019s dropped all the described hints because she\u2019s too guilty to end the relationship herself? Since she left, this has been on my mind day and night and it infringes on my ability to live normally. I lose sleep and I have a colossal amount of work to get done. I feel that if I focus on my work I won\u2019t have time to initiate conversation with her and she will just forget about me. I have had serious panic attacks over schoolwork and I am extremely work driven to a point where I worry myself into apathy or inefficient study habits. I constantly compare myself to others (her included), who I know are not suffering like I am, and I feel as if I am not validated for my hard work then I am nothing. Every time I see my girlfriend living comfortably and balanced it makes me think of how worthless and pathetic I am. It doesn\u2019t help that I now have relationship anxiety on top of all this, that I have to manage in my own or over text, with someone extremely busy with family matters). Maybe I\u2019m not in the forefront of her mind like she is on mine, but then again - what does that mean?Sorry guys, I think I could talk for days about this but that\u2019s generally the gist of it. Apologies for wall of text, but if anyone could just read through this and reassure me that would be great."

        "selftext": "For the record, I'm a male, 24 years of age, from India. Not been diagnosed by a medical professional as having anxiety. But I generally have more anxiety than most people around me.&amp;#x200B;The thought of travelling alone over a long distance scares me. Going to a new place scares me.&amp;#x200B;So today I am going to Karnataka (a state in South India) from my hometown in Kerala (another South Indian state). My train is about to arrive in like less than three hours and my body and mind has already started getting anxious.&amp;#x200B;My mind says things like \"I may miss the train. People around me in the compartment may be awful guys and I may not be able to deal with them.\" My body is like, \"Here have this burning sensation in the underbelly. Take some acidity for decoration. Also take this feeling of about to vomit so that you can't eat something properly. Piss. Shit. Again shit. Some more shit. Cause if you don't shit now you may not get a good bathroom to shit later.\"&amp;#x200B;But I won't be cancelling this trip. This is just a beginning for me. If I cancel this trip I would be more sad in the long run, which I can't afford to be. I need to develop my courage muscles. Because this is the only way out. If I don't try I'll slip deeper into the dark hole. And the dark hole never ends. Forward is the only way out.&amp;#x200B;Most of the stories my mind tells me about the trip are just pure imagination.

        "title": "Wrote A Message To Myself For My Social Anxiety: My First Real Meditation Experience With Pot",
        "selftext": "So I decided to take a bubble bath with candles and stuff made it look all nice and relaxing, I haven't bubble bathed since I was a little kid btw but my sis suggested it, and I'm pretty desperate for something to work, so I upped the ante and decided to smoke some pot and do some meditation with the app Headspace and wrote a message to myself. I've tried meditation before but things never seemed to click so I just assumed meditating would never work for me but this time around was very different because of the pot I felt so intune with my thoughts, mood and body it felt very spiritual and relaxing, I've never had this feeling before it was nice. So here is what I wrote to myself. \"You've been too self involved with your emotions to the point where you've almost committed suicide, and had thoughts of suicide you almost broke all the hearts of the people that love and care about you, it was selfish,  but you're here and it's time to forgive yourself, you need to let your mind relax, just go out for a stroll , talk to **** or **** about it, shit maybe even go for a run but I guarantee you these medications will get you no where if you're relying on them, it may even worsen your condition, so try getting off them in a timely manner, and neither is smoking weed btw (if you do it all the time). We have to get in touch with our mind to improve our mood.  Mind over Mood makes so much more sense now. You're a good person yeah you may have a bad day but it's up to me to choose what day I have,  you should start everyday with a smile on your face, you should be greatful instead of sad, you have a roof over your head a family that loves and supports you, food on the table you're a good person, kind hearted, helpful, smart and yeah you've done some bad shit but that's okay no one's perfect people change, and this is your time to change, think of it as a natural transition in your life, yeah you may not be the smartest but is anyone ever the smartest? Is someone you work with the smartest? Or just some random person walking about? No. Same goes for just about everything thing else, whose really the strongest, toughest, bravest? Truth is nobody knows, for example; you may see The Strongest Person on Earth on tv or you may see spelling Bees  on tv but that shit doesn't matter there could be the strongest man somewhere in India or Africa that you've never heard about, There could be someone that's knows how to spell better than the next person (and yes I know my spelling is bad to the people that see this, I just don't give enough shits about it though, I just want people to feel better about themselves that's my only goal here maybe a mod can fix any errors and yes bad spellers that don't give a shit do exist \ud83d\ude01) think about it records are meant to be broken obstacles are there to be crushed so the truth technically is no one, there will always be someone new crowned these titles but does anyone really ever know? The world is a big fucking place, yeah some people may think it's them but that's just arrogance. Not everyone knows everything I guarantee it Not everyones on tv, not everyone wants attention and that's okay, so it's okay to be wrong every now and again, it's okay to be playing video games at my age, it's okay to be interested in video games and technology, and nerdy shit, it's okay to just be you and not pay attention to the news and the negativity going on in the world, it's okay to not know everything in the news or Its okay not to know the the grown up shit like taxes, insurance, finance stuff all this because you're gonna learn about it eventually \ud83d\ude02 (I'm 28) you just have to find your crowd, it's never too late. Everyone has something unique about them just be you. Just good ol' you. Its fine. This isn't saying don't learn this stuff or not to work on your weaknesses but just go at your pace, you might be a little slow at times but that's okay, everyone is different and we'll all eventually get there. It's okay to be the quiet one, maybe give your 2c on a subject or two, honestly who gives a fuck? Just be you and give yourself your heart back and let that shit beat like it's never beat before. Be kinder to yourself, the world is a big tough place, but it's even tougher when your beating yourself up all the time, so you're gonna change that feeling because the world can also be a wonderful place because it teaches us lessons to life, something you'll miss out on if you're not here. So from here on out just live and don't worry so much.- Signed: Someone who has aspirations of working in IT (like I said I'm a nerd \ud83d\ude0b), but stuck in a deadend job at minimum wage because of my social anxiety issues since childhood that I've never worked on until now and will continue to do so. Also I don't smoke pot often because of my medication, but once I'm off that I hope to continue smoking this good stuff more often. \ud83d\udc4c\"Anyways thanks for reading, this is hard to put out in the public on the internet but if reading this helps even one person to me it's worth it,  I'll continue working on more CBT stuff like meditating, being more mindful of myself and others, setting goals. My anxiety has gotten so bad that stepping into a store gives me cold sweats and my heart racing, at times I don't even want to leave the house, I bailed on my friend a few too many times, (My only friend) who doesn't know about my issues and not really sure how to tell him about all this stuff, this friend is like a brother to me so if any advice or tips please feel free to share them. \ud83d\ude42"

        "selftext": "Where should I start this from? The time I was in heaven or the time I\u2019m in hell? Let\u2019s chose the good side first! My life had nothing in it no achievement, no wealth, no goal, just zippo! But the greatest thing I had then was happiness, I was living a normal life just as a normal regular human would! But then the god took the one thing that really matters and cursed me with everything. I now had everything literally, parents paid off the debts in India so people won\u2019t come hunting for us when we go back, I completed an AS degree, parents bought a ranch house, I was doing an internship, now only 2 years I had to struggle at a 4 year university and I was ready to settle. But at this point I had lost everything, even after having everything. Did I mention I was also in great shape? Yeah, heard it right, I was 140 pounds lean muscles from 3 years of continuous gyming, on top of that I was a vegetarian and a non- smoker and a non- alcoholic and all a nicest guy could ever possess. But I had lost it all! My peace, my calmness, my confidence, my normal ness; in other words my happiness. Right when I moved in to the new house when I almost finished AS degree in the early years of 2019.  I was a freak, a creep, a weirdo, a retard, and so much more a person with SAD is called out with. And I agreed with all, I myself believed I am this person, I have no life all the hard work was for nothing, if I will be living like this for the rest of my life. Did I mention my experiences? Oh boy, here we go\u2026 I am afraid to do family dinner, to walk to my car, to go to a restaurant, to sit in a class, to go to the internship, to go to the gym, even hanging out with friends, basically everything! All I liked doing was to be alone to sit in my room with windows and doors closed. I am living in hell!!! I eat food like an animal, I was fond of enjoy eating food, but now just to show I\u2019m having something in my mouth. My life has no meaning now, all I wanted was for the god to take everything from me and return back myself. I tried commiting suicide before but I was addicted to playing a stupid game alone in my room, that I couldn\u2019t free myself. I am so worst I am the guy who makes everyone feel awkward. I am the shame in the family, I\u2019m ashamed to be born at my lovely parents. Now I have taken steps to improve myself; to be normal, but so far nothing has worked out. I have tried total exposure theory;  which in my opinion only works out for particular event. I am now finding peace  in drinking, smoking and doing drugs. I drink and smoke from time to time( hiding this from parents). I think, if I keep going on this path, I will be even more shame to my family. Everything will also call me an addict alone with being so many other names. I can foresee my future, neither will I be able to complete my bachelors degree, nor will I regularly attend internship. With these failures I will bring in more drugs, and stuff; which will eventually slowly end my life. Now I don't foresee my future self getting married, but I can predict the outcome if I do, I will be divorced within weeks! Having failure in life and addiction to drugs, I will lose everyone close to me. I will be lonely, eventually I will kill myself hanging or hire someone to shoot me in my head; I have read these are the quickest and painless ways of going out. Now this is the prediction if I end year 2019 being a weirdo. Hence, I will give myself time to improve, if not than, this way of ending life is too slow; I would rather do it soon enough!"

But she could not conceive naturally as she could not endure the pain of intercourse. So, yes, no sex but she wants children (since, starting of marriage there was no intercourse but we decided to give time as we both were inexperienced). Anyways, we went in for IUI (artificial insemination) couple of times and it failed. There was a long gap between subsequent IUI's because of my mother's cancer. Now, she underwent a surgery for endometriosis and the doctor finally told us to go in for IVF.&amp;#x200B;I am not financially stable. I do not want to spend all my savings on doctors and children. My wife used to work till 2015 but she does not want to work anymore and want to have children. The IVF cost is going to be around USD 4,000/- followed by delivery charged to the tune of USD 1,500/- then whole life I have to spend on the child. My own medical expenses are a lot monthly.&amp;#x200B;This has resulted in lot of anxiety for me to the tune of panic attack. What can I do to reduce it? I cannot talk to my wife as I have done it multiple times with no success. She just doesn't listen. And no use talking to parents. I cannot go to a therapist as it will result in flurry of questions and accusations.&amp;#x200B;Just tell me how to handle it. Thanks."

Panic attacks in the middle of the day for no obvious reasons, sleep paralysis and nightmares almost every other night, didn't have the will to perform basic actions like brushing my teeth, taking a bath, even sometimes waking up was too much of a task. I'd started isolating myself from all my friends and would just sulk in my room all day. Its like there's a switch somewhere inside my brain- at one point I am all jovial, happy and laughing and then the next second my face drops, heart starts beating like crazy and I'm trying to hold back tears. 2 weeks back, out of the blue, I had this window of clarity suddenly, and I finally decided to seek help. Since I'm a college student, I have a lot of financial constraints, and after looking up the hourly rates on Google, the fact that I can't afford a psychologist stressed me out even more.But then I found out my college has a permanent student councillor and therapist, and every day I'd start walking to her room, only to tell myself this is a very bad idea, stop midway and go back to sulk in my room. This routine went on for 4 days, until I finally convinced myself today that I fucking need to go in and seek help, and I didn't stop, I continued walking until I reached her room, opened the door ,walked in and started talking. All the while my mind was still blaring like crazy- this is a bad idea! This is a bad idea! But while I was shaking inside as I told her about my problems, when I exited, I actually had a plan with me, as to how to tackle it all one step at a time! After a long long time, I think I finally made the right choice today."

Was down to just two more questions (had the most weightage in the paper. Were also the easiest ones) until I realised time was up. My stomach caved in as I passed it onto the Invigilator. Results were due in 2 more months, and I spent both those months overthinking every possibility from me not getting into a good college to outright failing the subject.  The results came out and I actually ended up scoring 80% on the paper. I went through it and there's no way I scored that good (me not being able to finish the paper and all). This kinda pissed me off even more cause I knew the paper was really easy, and I would've scored really well on my own (it was probably an upgrade from the lecturer, or could've just been a correction error)  if I managed my time better. Almost applied for a re-exam due to the anxiety of not knowing if it was really my score. Still bothers me to this day cause I worked hard and aced all the other Physics exams, but feel like I didn't earn this one. Maybe I did really score that well, maybe I didn't.

If you are interested you can read that post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9j3aol/7\\_tips\\_for\\_reducing\\_your\\_anxiety\\_without\\_taking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9j3aol/7_tips_for_reducing_your_anxiety_without_taking/)&amp;#x200B;Trying to defeat your anxiety can be very hard and overwhelming. Defeating anxiety might be the hardest things you'll ever have to do in your life! But sometimes small changes can bring about big results. And whoever you are, the tips in this article WILL lessen your anxiety. I\u2019ve seen these tips work personally, and most of them have been scientifically proven. Some of these tips might totally change your life!&amp;#x200B;So here we go: 7 more tips to reduce your anxiety:# Anxiety tip #1 - Stop Watching The NewsWatching the news can produce a lot of anxiety. Our subconscious brains are not good at putting the news in perspective. They have a hard time realizing that the war we are seeing on television, is actually 2000 miles away. Because of this, **news can make us feel like we are in serious danger, when we are actually totally safe.** If you stop watching the news you\u2019ll be a little bit less informed about what\u2019s going on. But you\u2019ll be shocked to find how little that actually matters. Experiment with not watching the news for a while and see what happens. &amp;#x200B;# Anxiety tip #2 - Talk to people about your anxietyA lot of us don\u2019t want to talk about our anxiety to others. I used to believe that I would scare people if I told them about my doom-thoughts about the world, so I never talked to anyone about my anxiety. But it helps a lot to talk about all your anxious feelings and thoughts. It can make us feel very lonely if no one knows what is going on in our heads. **If we talk about our anxiety, we\u2019ll feel less alone and more connected to others.** It will surprise you how many people want to talk with you about your anxiety. Most people actually love the feeling of helping people they know!We got to make sure we ask them about their problems too though. This way we can get a very healing dialogue going. With anxiety we can feel like it\u2019s us against the big scary world. Talking with other people about your anxiety reduces this feeling a lot. &amp;#x200B;# Anxiety tip #3 - Find out which emotions you have suppressed, and express themThere is a big link between suppressed emotions and anxiety. Suppressed emotions are emotions that we did not allow ourselves to feel when we were younger. Maybe when we were a small child, our parents stopped giving us love and attention if we got angry. Because we were so dependent on our parents back then, we started to suppress our anger to not get in trouble. Then we might have internalized that, if we are angry, we are not worthy of love.But deep down the anger is still there. This creates a lot of internal friction and\u2026ANXIETY. **Expressing and feeling our suppressed emotions can lower our anxiety a ton.** Want to find out which emotion you have suppressed? Ask yourself this question: \u2018What emotion in others triggers me the most?\u2019What is your answer?There is a good chance that this emotion is actually the emotion that you have suppressed in yourself. &amp;#x200B;# Anxiety tip #4 - Do Breathing ExercisesAn increasing amount of research is currently being done on certain breathing exercises from India. And many have been found to significantly decrease anxiety! Especially breathing exercises from a system called \u2018Sudarshan Kriya\u2019 has been scientifically shown to work very well against anxiety. I personally do these kinds of breathing exercises almost every single morning. When I started doing them I found a giant decrease in my anxiety. **Doing these breathing exercises is by far the most effective thing I\u2019ve ever done to get rid of my anxiety.** These exercises actually work remarkably quick too. After one of these exercises you\u2019ll usually feel immediately calmer than you did before. Here is a link to a video explaining one of the exercises that is part of the Sudarshan Kriya system: r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQrsJ-yZWV8&amp;t=153s&amp;#x200B;# Anxiety tip #5 - Get an evening ritualMost of us know that morning rituals can be great. But have you heard of evening rituals?Getting the best sleep that we can is critical if we are suffering from anxiety. But most anxious people are bad sleepers. We have a hard time calming ourselves down in the evening.Having an evening ritual can help you with this. Put your phone on airplane mode and turn of your computer after a certain time. Then only do things that calm you down, like reading, listening to music, writing, etc.Doing this consistently will help you rest and de-stress. The we can get our bodies and minds calm in the evening, the less anxious we will become. **Being offline in the evening and focusing on calming activities can reduce our anxiety big time!**&amp;#x200B;# Anxiety tip #6 - Practise mindfulness meditationMindfulness meditation has been scientifically proven to work in helping with anxiety disorders. I\u2019ve personally meditated daily for years now, and found it to be great source of happiness and peace. **Mindfulness meditation will not only decrease your anxiety, it will also make you better at enjoying life in general.** Mindfulness meditation DOES take time to start working. Expect to do it daily for at least 1.5 months before you start feeling some real results.If you can get yourself to practice mindfulness regularly and in the right way, it can definitely help to reduce anxiety.# Anxiety tip #7 - Be In Physical Contact With PeopleBeing anxious can produce the stress hormone Cortisol. Being touched regularly actually decreases the amount of cortisol in our bodies, making us feel less stressed and less anxious. Some of us feel like we are not the \u2018touchy type\u2019. But by practicing we can become much more comfortable with touching other people and being touched ourselves. Most people like being hugged by people they like. **We can make a habit of hugging our friends, family, and maybe even co-workers.** If we have very little \u2018touch opportunities\u2019 in our lives, we can get a massage every now and then. Or we can try to join some kind of social group where hugging is considered nice and normal behavior.As a teenager I had long periods of time where almost no one touched me. It ramped up my anxiety a lot! Being touched is important. Getting more soft touching in your life can make a world of difference..&amp;#x200B;Those were seven more tips for defeating anxiety.

This is also just a post describing my experience with him. I hope you guys get something out of it.&amp;#x200B;All my life I felt that I had generally high anxiety. I right now has no job and is kind of afraid to try out something new and challenging.&amp;#x200B;Yesterday, due to my mom's advice we went to see a psychiatrist. This guy happened to be one of the many mental expert guys whose approach I didn't happen to like.&amp;#x200B;We were half an hour late for our appointment. But we called him on the way and said to him about it. Then when we reached the place, there were no other patients. We went in.&amp;#x200B;He asked. I started explaining the things. I feel afraid when starting some new things, meeting new people in a social gathering, going to new places, facing interviews etc. I said that I worked for one year after my post graduation in a field unrelated to my studies. Then left it as it was a dead end job. Just after my post graduation, I sat at home for close to one year due to fear of facing interviews. After that only I went to work. That too I got the work because of a recommendation by a well wisher of mine.&amp;#x200B;This doctor was kind of angry/irritated. From time to time he was looking at his watch. Then he said, \"So, now you are doing nothing.\" We had already gone to another doctor before and he was sitting there just to get some money. He tried overblowing my problems and make it look like a big thing. So I had left him. This doctor asked about that and I just said that I didn't like him.&amp;#x200B;Now a few weeks later I have an exam coming up for a job and this doctor was like, \"You really need to study for that.\" I know that I need to study. But he was over emphasizing the thing. Like it's a do or die situation. My anxiety increases when I'm put in such a mindset. So I just took it easily.&amp;#x200B;This doctor was not smiling at me. I felt like he was not that interested in me. His body language and talk all communicated to me something like he considered me as somewhat of a pathetic person who has not put in some needed efforts. At least that was the kind of vibes I got.&amp;#x200B;Then he started counting the problems I am having like, lack of energy, interpersonal relations going bad, negative thoughts etc. Then he asked me like, \"Shouldn't we change all this?\" I said yes.&amp;#x200B;Then he prescribed medication to me. Now I am a bit afraid to take medicines and I asked him if it would be a problem to take it. Then he was like, \"Don't you take medicines when having headache, fever, infection etc? Take it just like that.\" He specifically said that this medicine won't cause sleepiness. The medicine was Escitalopram oxalate.&amp;#x200B;I came back home and googled the medicine and there it said in the side effects that there would be sleepiness. Then I looked on reddit and some of the people said they felt kind of foggy in the first week. Also the internet says that stopping it suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms. I felt it is better not to take this medicine and better not to go to this guy who seems to have a short temper.&amp;#x200B;What do you guys know about this medicine Escitalopram oxalate?"

My SO and I (we're currently on a temporary break for me to figure things out, but calling him my ex hurts.),we started dating when I was 15 and he was 16. It's been two years now.About 6 months into our relationship, I was going through a very hard time and was almost suicidal. I told him about this and his immediate reaction was that I had problems. He also said he was scared of me. I was too hurt to do anything at that point so I let it slide. This behavior of his persisted and I told him I needed a break. Fast forward to now. He feels that his behavior was childish and immature and I wish I could explain exactly how it is for traction.I'm in India and there isn't much awareness about mental issues here so that justifies his reaction a bit. Any suggestions on how to phrase it are welcome."

Not clinically diagnosed as having anxiety, yet feels anxious than most people around me.&amp;#x200B;I haven't yet made a solid career move and my anxiety and fear keeps me from revealing to myself what I truly want out of life. I want to become a writer. But then I get doubts if I really like that or if I am choosing it just because it involves less interaction with people.&amp;#x200B;Then I used to have a gf. I used to like her for a long time but never went ahead and told her my feelings. She first told me that she had feelings for me. I thought she was trying to make me feel embarrassed. I didn't take her seriously. Few months later she again told me. This time I reciprocated just because some of our friends told me maybe she likes me. That's how the relationship started.&amp;#x200B;Now I poured all my anxiety and fear to her, to get some relief. She couldn't handle it all and said that we should part ways. I too felt it would be better. Her parents are looking for a groom.&amp;#x200B;This breakup happened two months before. We got into a relationship around 4 years ago. Relationship was not going good at all, due to my anxiety and fear.&amp;#x200B;Now I haven't gotten over her. Besides I don't know what career I should take. I am trying to work things out. Sometimes I feel sad about this whole affair called life. Like, where is the happiness? I used to be more happy before. Even during the relationship, we had some happy moments. Now it's all gone. She is practical.&amp;#x200B;Let me come to the point. I texted one of my female friends just like that and said life is so sad and boring and shit and happiness is not seen anywhere around. I didn't mention about the breakup. The female friend of mine is actually a close friend of my ex. I didn't want to bring up the breakup thing to her. Previously when we used to have fights, I used to text and call this female friend to know what my girl was doing. I have another female friend too who is also her close one. I think I kind of started talking more to them only after I got into a relationship with this girl. Whenever we used to have temporary breakups, due to my fear and anxiety, I used to contact them to know about this girl.&amp;#x200B;Well last day I said to this female friend about life is difficult. Like a general topic. Then she was like it's all going to be ok and that we'll know along the way what we want out of life. Then she was like I don't have much problems now, that I am thinking and creating non existent problems. That I should stop thinking this much.&amp;#x200B;I am sure she doesn't know what it's like to overthink or feel anxious. Whatever a person is feeling, it is never invalid. Please don't say to someone that they're problem is not at all a problem and that she should stop thinking too much."

        "selftext": " I don't know if this is the place to ask this question. If this post is more apt for some other sub, please recommend.I am 25, male. from India.I feel like I am having teenage angst only now. I do a small job at an office. As small time journalist. I say this because I didn't have any background in journalism. Got the job because of recommendation. I am afraid and anxious about a lot of things. Generally more anxious than others around me. Have NOT been diagnosed as having crippling anxiety by a professional.Recently started feeling that elders around me were lying to me. They said studying and getting good grades can help you. That's the main thing. I was quite studious in my school days. In my 11th and 12th I had difficulties. But NOT due to teenage problems. I chose the wrong stream. Science. I was inclined towards humanities. Literature. I was afraid to change schools to pursue literature. So stuck with science. Was feeling tension back in 11th and 12th. But still managed to get a decent percentage.Then in degree I took literature. Now I complete M.A. But recently I realized that my anxiety and fear is causing me so much of problems. After M.A I simply sat at home for like one year just because I was afraid to go for interviews. Right now, after doing a job (a dead end one) I feel like I got some life experience.People always said that studying is the thing which would help me. Right now I realize that people use their connection and influence to achieve their thing. Non studious people are doing better than me and they're cool about it. Elders said to concentrate on studies more and not to get involved in romantic affairs. But they actually wanted me to experience those things. They feel that if they tell the truth to young people, the young people may take advantage of the situation. But I was too obedient. I believed that getting into relationships in schools is wrong. Elders have this belief that only if they are too strict would the children be obeying half of what they say. But that was not the case with me. I obeyed fully of what they said.Now I feel regret that I listened to my parents and elders about all of those lies. Besides nobody told me to take care of my anxiety and fear. I thought they would go away on its own once I enter my twenties. Now I am solidly in my twenties and I realize that only if I take action to overcome my fear and anxiety will it go away. Recently my mom said that it is ok to get into relationship and drink and smoke, just to have an experience about it. I was furious when I heard that. She lied to me because she believed that I would go into the wrong path if she reveled the truth. She never saw that I believed whatever the elders said. That I kept my brain as a showpiece.Even now I feel that elders don't really understand me. Mom talks about getting me married (we have arranged marriages over here). I say that I am not mature enough for that. She doesn't believe that. Her talk and body language conveys it to me.Moreover, I am in the midst of a breakup. My first love. Happened in my early twenties. Was anxious while in the relationship because I was brainwashed into thinking that getting into relationship is to be done only after at least getting a job. Besides I had anxiety and fear always with me. Didn't know how to take the relationship forward. Now I don't have a decent job (I'm leaving the job in one day). At the girl's home, they're looking for a groom. She says that I am too immature. Bit sad about this breakup happening.I really don't feel like 25. I feel like 16 or 17. Just a guy ready to go to college to have some fun. I have seen people going to college with that mindset.I was always a late bloomer. I thought it was wrong to talk about sex and get attracted to girls when I was in school. Only like, after getting into college did my perception change. Never even knew about masturbation till 16. But then, I was addicted to porn and masturbation after that.Does this 'feeling teen angst only in 20s' really happen?"

        "selftext": "So I moved across the country to attend Law school, leaving all of my friends and family behind. One day in September, my brain just started racing with thoughts like how I left all my friends and family, was having trouble making new friends, feeling like I wasn't good enough to be in Law School, feeling like I had no idea what I was doing, and many other thoughts. These thoughts started spiralling very quickly in my mind and I felt severely overwhelmed; I felt like I wanted to cry and I didn't know what to do. For lack of a better word, at that moment I felt crippled. I had to sit down and do some deep breathing exercises to calm down.It happened again in October while I was trying to fall asleep. That time, every time I shut my eyes, it felt like my mind was being squashed with the spiral of thoughts. It felt worse. It happened again in twice in November and once again in December while studying for finals.During winter break I went home. I realized I needed time to myself so I told myself I would relax. I had planned a trip with some friends to go to a resort in Denver and relax, spend time with my mother, and just enjoy time with my girlfriend. That didn't exactly happen. What ended up happening is my girlfriend broke up with me (she spent two weeks in Belize while I was taking finals and it was life changing for her so she came back and decided that she wanted to work towards travelling the world and didn't feel like she could do that while in our relationship) and on Christmas my grandmother (maternal) in India had a stroke so my mother flew to India to be with her (so my mother wasn't at home. I couldn't go with my mother because my passport was back in Law School and I felt helpless). A week after break was over (and I was back in the semester), my other grandmother (paternal) in India passed away. Last week my grandmother (maternal) went back into the hospital and is now in need of a pacemaker.Since I got back to this semester, the intensity and frequency of my overwhelming mind spirals have drastically increased. They happen about twice a week and now they include thoughts about what I did wrong in my relationship, how I feel helpless about my grandmothers, am I losing myself and who I am, whether I will actually get a summer 1L internship, am I cut out for this, feeling as I am not learning the same as my classmates, etc.I starting seeing a University provided therapist a few weeks ago but I feel as though it's only getting worse. I don't know what to do and I honestly feel scared. My mind constantly feels pressed now and the spirals aren't getting better. Does anyone have any advice that could help me? I appreciate any advice that you may have!"

        "selftext": "What's helped my anxiety the most weren't things I added to my life, but things I REMOVED. For instance: * **The news.** I stopped watching, reading, and listening to it altogether. No more conspiracy sites, gloom-and-doom economy blogs, or how to survive the apocalypse. And no more sensationalist overly dramatic headlines. It never helps me on a daily basis, and most of that information is worthless, wrong, or harmful. I replaced the news with happy content: standup comedy, funny movies, uplifting songs, joy-inducing books. It really helped. ([My favorite \"anti-news\"](http://www.pinterest.com/charliehoehn/anti-news/)) * **Caffeine.** I only have 1/2 cup of coffee each day, instead of 4. I don't drink aspartame either ([it's poison](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8373935)). * **Vampires.** Not the characters in the Twilight books, but people who were constantly sucking the life out of me. I had to cut them out because they always made me feel so much worse whenever we interacted. I made a conscious effort to surround myself with positive people instead. It was one of the best decisions I've made.That being said, I have come across a number of amazing resources that shifted my mindset and ultimately helped me conquer my anxiety. All of these things changed my life for the better:**BOOKS**[Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul](http://www.amazon.com/Play-Shapes-Brain-Imagination-Invigorates/dp/1583333789). The message of this book hit me like a brick wall: I was constantly depriving myself of play, which made my hyper-anxious. For years, I\u2019d mentally blocked myself from having guilt-free fun. I was an isolated workaholic who was extremely adept at rejecting everything that wasn\u2019t productive. I couldn\u2019t enjoy any form of leisure if it didn\u2019t earn money or help my career. I never allowed myself to play or be in the moment, because that meant I wasn\u2019t working. But I couldn\u2019t really work because I always felt tired and jaded. And then I burned out. This made me realize what I needed to do to get back to my normal self: allow myself to play again.[Outwitting the Devil](http://www.amazon.com/Outwitting-Devil-Secret-Freedom-Success/dp/1454900679). Napoleon Hill -- the author of the perennial bestseller *Think and Grow Rich* -- wrote another book in the 1930's... that was just published two years ago. They never released it during his lifetime because it was considered too controversial, and his family worried about it destroying his reputation. Ironically, this book is arguably better because it talks about how Hill (and thousands of others) overcame their crippling anxiety and deepest fears.[Remember Be Here Now](http://www.amazon.com/Be-Here-Now-Ram-Dass/dp/0517543052). This book\u2019s simple reminder to live in the present changed my life. I later discovered that Be Here Now inspired Steve Jobs\u2019 trip to India and his experiments with LSD.[Trauma Releasing Exercises](http://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Releasing-Exercises-TRE-revolutionary/dp/1419607545/). Tremors are a natural means for mammals to discharge excess energy after a traumatic event. But unlike most species, adult humans typically prevent themselves from having tremors. Why? Because we avoid behavior that makes us look weak or vulnerable. In other words, we are so self-conscious that we unknowingly block our body\u2019s natural (yet embarrassing) function during times of great stress. As a result, we make it super difficult to overcome trauma because we\u2019re constantly holding in so much excess energy. That's what TRE does- it releases the deep chronic tension anxious people hold in from constantly working themselves into fight-or-flight mode. And it really works. Look on Youtube for demos of the exercises if you don't want to buy the book.**PRODUCTS**[Aerobie Flying Ring](http://www.amazon.com/AEROBIE-PRO-RING-Colors-Vary/dp/B0000789T2). I'm a big believer that exercise should be fun. And since exercise is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety, stress, and depression, I try to get my exercise through outdoor sports I can play with friends. This is the best toy for playing catch because you're constantly having to run around while chasing it. It\u2019s light, durable, fun, and cheap ($9).[Vitamin B](http://www.amazon.com/Twinlab-Stress-B-Complex-Vitamin-Capsules/dp/B0000531CQ) and [fish oil](http://www.amazon.com/Coromega-Omega-3-Supplement-Squeeze-90-Count/dp/B000FFQATA). Anxious people tend to be really low on vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids (stress depletes these resources). I started supplementing with two servings of fish oil and vitamin B every day, and within a week, I was feeling sharper and more energetic. That tight feeling in my brain disappeared. **SITES**[Flux](http://justgetflux.com/). The bright white light that you refer to as your \u201ccomputer\u201d might be disrupting your internal rhythm at night. Get this free app to have your screen\u2019s lighting automatically switch to a sunset hue in the evening. And if you TRULY want to reduce your anxiety, stop looking at all screens -- including your cell phone -- by 9pm. Trust me.[Raptor Mascot on Rollerblades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEcPBq7zxto). Every time I thought I was going to have a panic attack, I'd watch this video. It was like my reset program, and I STILL crack up every time I see it. If all else fails, just keep watching this on repeat until you\u2019re no longer worried.[How I Cured My Anxiety](http://charliehoehn.com/2013/05/19/how-i-cured-my-anxiety/). Here's the story behind the first big realization I had which ultimately allowed me to overcome my anxiety. (Disclosure: A little self promotion-ish, but more than 100,000 people have read the post and it's helped a lot of them).# # #What are your best resources? What's changed your life?

        "selftext": "Hello Folks,I am 21 years old Indian Guy and i need a very important guidance at this stage of my life. My father runs a business related to mechanical engineering and we're a middle class family. I've multiple differences with my father, biggest of them is ; i want to live life on my terms professionally and personally. My father is a very adamant and narrow minded guy i feel. He forced me to opt for science whereas i wanted to choose commerce after my High school and then this engineering thing happened which was again obviously forceful decision. I just finished my college time span of 4 years doing engineering which i didn't wanted to.I wanted to do Bachelor's in Journalism &amp; Mass Communication considering my interests.All my life I've been a dreamer and I've always thought that there will be a time after graduation when I'll get to live life as per my wishes. My father has a always imposed his likings and dislikings on me. During my school time my interest was developed in subjects like Economics, English and Hindi (National Indian Language) but he would continuously force me for studying Maths and talk about maths and what not. I was a playful kid and didn't studied much in my childhood but I managed to get average scores like 70 % . He didn't liked this,he wanted me to score top class and he started beating me with kicks,punches or even sticks. He couldn't bear that his kid is an average. This developed a fear in me and fear lead to lying. I started lying about my test scores and grades,he would catch me and then beat me more. With all these things happening around with a 9-10 years old me,i started loosing interest in studies completely. I would study very less and then fear while sitting in examination hall that i would be beaten when he would see the result. These things continued for around 4-5 years. I got some brain,i started studying right before high school because i realised that i can get rid of maths forever and study the subjects which i really wanted to. I scored well considering my records back then, scored 86% and i was happy that i can finally study what i wanted to. I was wrong,he forced me to choose science, was promised again that I can choose my graduation once I'm done with my school. Again a false promise,i waa forced to do engineering. I cried,a lot but that didn't changed anything.College,i unwillingly started my engineering college.I was seeking a vent for emotional balance ,i started smoking, drinking and i was least interested in studying engineering because 60-70% of it was maths and i hated every bit of it. 4 years passed,i cleared 36 exams out of 48 exams and i've lied that cleared them all.Done with college without any knowledge of my course,i started finding a escape from all of it. I knew that if i sat at home,he would ask me join buisness with him which I didn't wanted at all so i found a job at a travel company as a customer service agent.I was discovering this new world of customer service and how people working there are making good money. One thing lead to another,i found a job at one of India's leading start-up related to food home delivery. I was putting my bestest efforts at the job because this company had much better opportunities as an employee,one can switch departments and i was targetting management department.My pay was double as compared to my earlier job &amp; while these life sequences took place,my interest was developed in Entrepreneurship. But again, my father said that I've to join factory and i was given no choice,i took a stand. He asked me to leave home if i cannot live as per his terms,i left home. 4 days out of home,i stayed at my friend's place and i searched for a place which i was going to rent for my living. I got a call from Maa to come back and he has agreed  for me to do anything i want professionally. 10 days after i went back to home,he created a scene and asked me to leave the job and this time he created extreme pressure on me. I'm his elder son, I've a younger brother and he said that it's my responsibility to handle the buisness and all my life I've been a faliure and much more things that emotionally drained me at that moment. I decided to leave the job and join factory - Dad's buisnessToday, 14th Jan,2019.I've spent 6 months here in the I've been doing market job of bringing work and delivering work.I handle the accounts. Even i work on the machines because of shortage of workers.,still i get all the curse which my father says all day. He says I'm a looser and I've always denied what he has asked me to do. I don't talk to him now on a personal level.   I've tried talking to him and making him understand what i want to do but I've got no positive results. He becomes violent when me Maa are arguing for the right thing or making him understand something. I want some time to figure out yhe right thing but i can't think of anything staying here in this place and around him.I have a partner with whom I'm in relationship for last 4 years.My relationship is suffering because i don't get much personal time to spend with her. I'm most of the times in the factory &amp; in self doubt about how I've lived my life. He didn't let me take any decision on my own,i fear he will not even let me marry my partner because she's from a different caste and we're Bhramins. Being a guy who wants to go out in the open and have my own experiences,all this is killing me. I've got one life and i want to live it doing things which i like,which make me feel happy. I understood his point to giving me a secure professional option &amp; everything but that's not something which i seek. I want to have my own journey and i want to know how does it feels to become something on your own. My father has kept a condition that if i want to do anything else than joining his buisness wether it be a computer science engineering Job which was my college course,i will be kicked out of the house. I'm not very sure about leaving the housing or you can say I'm way more confused than ever. I love my mother &amp; younger sibling but the things happening around are acting like slow death. What should i do? Please tell me  I am shattered and lost now."

        "title": "Went to hospital from severe panic attack and since then cannot gain control over my life, really need some advice / help",
        "selftext": "A lot has happened to me this year and this is my first time posting anything about my anxiety. I will try very hard to be concise and will include a TL;DR for anyone who doesn't want to invest or doesn't have the time to read the whole backstory. Thank you ahead of time if you have taken time to read this.**Edit: This doesn't seem to be getting anyones attention. If there is a better place to post, or some template I have not seen in the rules please advise me further.**---**Backstory**Earlier this year in March I suffered a severe panic attack that I needed an ambulance for. I didn't know it was a panic attack at the time, and I never identified as someone who was anxious, however, I can see some of the minor anxiety symptoms over the course of the last decade. The symptoms of that night I went to the hospital include:* Shortness of breath, cannot catch my breath, feels like cannot get any oxygen* Tightness of throat / chest* Sweaty palms* Tingling hands and arms* Pale skin* Shaking and shivering* Feeling faint (almost fainted, head and body dipped once or twice)* Any sort of physical movement made me feel like I ran around the block and would feel winded / more breathless. Even shifting my butt from one position to another was enough to make me feel like I ran a mile. (Easily the scariest symptom which the doctors couldn't identify as part of the panic)I was under an immense amount of stress at that time. My Uncle who I was close with passed away earlier in the year and left me a very small (emphasis on small) policy in my name which my grandmother, aunt, and father fought me over the entire first half of this year. We are not on good terms to this day. They texted me, sent me mail with evolving changing stories about how my Uncle actually wanted to use the money etc. I also started the biggest contract I had with a client. I run a development studio and was very excited to work on this project, but the project slowly turned into hell after my hospital visit.Fast forward to today..---**Triggers**Since that hospital visit I have had a couple dozen smaller panic attacks and cannot control the physical reactions that happen for certain random triggers. The triggers that I have identified so far are the following..* Eating and feeling full (the anxiety is worse if I am indulging in a light treat or something I know is unhealthy like fries. I eat very healthy and very light portions)* Travelling long distances in car / vehicle* Medicine (.. this one bugs me, needles, vaccinations, bloody Advil for gods sake)* Large amounts of exercise (what I mean is like a long run, or anything that you push yourself physically for)There might be more that I haven't identified but this is the bulk of the triggers I think. ---**Coping Techiques**I don't have anything that is really successful in coping with this, which is why I am posting here. The most frequent symptom that I notice first before any other symptoms is the tightening of my neck/chest. Mostly my neck, it feels like a giant grapefruit stuck in my throat half the day sometimes. I have been popping fishermans friends with extra menthol to cope with that. It numbs the throat a little bit so I don't notice it as much.When I feel a panic attack coming on I can't do anything. Doing things makes it worse, and I can't think straight. I need distraction so I usually just plop myself on the couch and turn something that requires no thought to watch on and just wait it out, sometimes a couple minutes, sometimes hours. It is preventing me from doing anything, from living. I have a big India trip my SO and her family and I are supposed to go on at the end of this year. I am FREAKING out about it because I don't feel capable of evening living in a comfortable house let along exploring a new place like India. The vaccinations I need are constantly on my mind and I can't get over them, and it feels like the end of times.I need to find a way to get over these symptoms and preferably before this trip so I can not waste a couple thousand by bailing last minute on this trip. Here are some things I have tried.* Breathing techniques (5 in, 5 held, 5 out, 5 held. It helps SOMETIMES, depending on the severity. It is annoying to half to stop half a dozen times a day to do this and consistent effort hasn't reduced the symptoms)* Grounding techniques (identify 5 colors around you, 3-4 sounds, 2-3 smells, 1-2 things you can touch. Hasn't helped) * Walks (Walks have always been almost spiritual for me and helped ground me a lot years ago, but they have very little affect these days. If my panic is setting in then I cannot do anything but sit still)* Therapists / Councilors* EMDR (I still feel like this might have some promise to deal with the childhood trauma but it is so expensive and I did about 7-8 sessions and ran out of money. Those sessions haven't really done anything. We never even got to the EMDR part yet really.)* Ativan (I took this one time and it didn't work for me aside from making me a bit tired. I have been to afraid to try it again as one of my triggers is pills / medicine)***On waitlist for Psychiatrists, nervous about the idea of taking pills for this***---**Additional Notes**I have some childhood trauma that I have sort of ignored for my entire life. I know there is 100% some impact to my ability to live happily due to this, but I am unsure of the connection to the anxiety. Due to this trauma I feel like I am constantly on alert. I NEVER feel relaxed, and always feel on edge. The only place I can sort of relax is at home doing very mundane boring things like gaming or television. It feels like it is getting worse the older I get.One BIG problem I have living my life today is that I cannot feel like I am in the present. Life passes by so quickly, and I am just floating there watching it pass me by. I feel constantly disassociated with life. When I am on a crowded bus or in a mall I feel like everything and everyone is not real. There is a lonely feeling of not having any support. In addition to that, if I have any future commitments, such as a big India trip coming up, I am further not able to focus on any tasks in the present. I have clients and projects that I have been working on and then BAM, India trip is a thing and I am not falling behind because I am incapable of pushing through this thing. One thing I have not mentioned at all is that I am so excited to start life / career projects when these symptoms are absent. It is so difficult because I feel ambitious, and I feel like I want to really start giving life all my effort, but then these symptoms creep in and turn everything around all the time. I feel bipolar sometimes.---**TL;DR*** Went to the hospital for severe panic attack* Since then getting constant smaller panic attacks and anxiety symptoms from really dumb triggers that I cannot control* Tried many coping techniques which have not reduced symptoms and often don't help with coping in the moment* Have known childhood trauma which I believe may be linked to current anxiety* Feel super duper disassociated and like I am alone, life moving by in a blink* Have upcoming trip to India which is freaking me out and I am not ready forIs there anyone better trained for this type of mental issues than a councillor or psychiatrists? Any specialized individuals?**Please provide me with some advice / help on things I can try. I am tired of letting life rule over me feeling powerless. It is so crippling some days all I can do is breakdown.**"

        "selftext": "I didn\u2019t know how to word the title, but I have PTSD and severe anxiety and depression. It affects every aspect of my life. I\u2019m posting here because I honestly don\u2019t know where else to post and I honestly don\u2019t have any one to talk to. My relationship is falling apart and I recently got kicked out of therapy for no shows. Therapy didn\u2019t help because it\u2019s hard to take someone seriously when she only can\u2019t relate to anything you\u2019re going through . My Doctor was from India and I could barley understand fuck all he said anyway.  I digress, I wake up in pain every day. I have nightmares every night. I\u2019m beginning to resent my girl because every time I try to talk to her she turns it into a competition. I tell her I feel like shit and she\u2019ll say she feels like shit as well. She\u2019s a bartender so she\u2019s on her feet a lot. She doesn\u2019t sleep next to me because I thrash around in my bed.  I had a dog and he helped me but he died from cancer and I\u2019ve been pretty fucked up since then.  I don\u2019t have family, I guess I have relatives but it\u2019s one of those situations where if I don\u2019t call I don\u2019t hear from them. My heart feels hard and my girlfriend told me that I\u2019m emotionless. Reality is that I turn them off because I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. I only feel happy when I drink or smoke up. It\u2019s like the only thing that turns off my brain. I have no motivation to do anything and my house is suffering because of it.  I\u2019ve been on disability for the last 10 years roughly and I think it\u2019s just making me woo, I\u2019ve been trying to find a part time job to take my mind off myself but due to my physical issues and lack of any skills I am unable to or do not qualify for the position. I say MITA because I feel that way, I look at other people who wake up and do these things, these normal things that people do every day and they seem like tremendous feats to me. My girlfriend needs a car and she cries because we can\u2019t afford it and I blame myself for that. I often think she\u2019s better off without me. I\u2019m on a cocktail of medicine \u201c12 pills\u201d in the morning and a few at night but they don\u2019t help. I\u2019m so detached and disinterested that I have like 20 texts I haven\u2019t read from people. Idk , sorry if this is the wrong place for it. Im new to Reddit and you can remove it if you want. I guess I just needed to vent "

        "selftext": "My parents and two little brothers (ages 16, 12) are both going with Greece without me in April. Usually this would not bother me because they have gone on vacations in the last two years (costa rica, Portugal) without me because I\u2019m still in college and I don\u2019t have breaks. It is the same case this year too, however what\u2019s making me upset is that my mother and father know that I\u2019ve been wanting to go to Greece since I was a child and yet they decide to go in April with my sniblings since I\u2019ll be in school. My mother claims that\u2019s its \u201cthe best season\u201d to go in April and that she and my dad aren\u2019t getting any younger so they should go. I get that parr but what I don\u2019t get is why they can\u2019t wait a few months and take me. They have no problem taking me to India in August but they\u2019re bitching about me wanting to go. My mother has said to me \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve to go and you haven\u2019t earned it yet\u201d but I have worked my ass off to get into medical school and I have an extremely high gpa. It bothers me that when I ask them about it, all they do is yell at me and tell me I can\u2019t control their life. I know this post is kind of a 1st world problem and I don\u2019t want it to come off as that but I\u2019m real upset about this and it\u2019s just ruining my week."

I had one again when i was in india and i had a very bad foodpoisoning. This one was a lot less terrifying and i didn't feel that bad the weeks after. Now yesterday i had something that felt like an anxiety attack it was not as bad as before but still really uncomfortable, i have had a crazy semester where I was really pushing my body to the limit because of deadlines and now i'm in the middle of exams. Today i decided to sleep in a little and give my body some rest. i feel better but i'm still tired, my vision is still a little fuzzy, my body is still kind of sore and my eyes feel kind of dry . i have noticed some small things the days before it started so i will be more able to anticipate them in the future. I really want to get back to normal as fast as possible because i have got a lot of work ahead of me.  I'm just curious how long do the aftereffects last for you guys and is there anyway to keep these to a minimum?"

        "selftext": "Hi i am 25 year old kid. I live in a 3rd world country..(India) by my age everyone has graduated and already having a job at least everyone around me everyone did well in their education and graduation and they have a job.But as for me i believe my parents when divorced at 12 basically my growth stopped i still feel like 12 in school i couldn't do anything i was bad at every i passed the school with a D Grade basically i failed to graduate and the worst thing is i don't know a thing about the shit i am studying i don't know anything about it i have to start over but ppl just say complete it.Talking to people scares me making up a conversation on my own is impossible for me to do.I have mental health issues i admit it have i been going to 6 psychaitrists but they all treated me like i had a physical disorder here take these 6 medicines which make you stop thinking. I couldn't handle it eventually my mom stopped it.My mother is religious she believes astrologers and such can save me but the fucking thing is the damn astrologers said when they looked at my hand nothing will happen of him and nothing will work best way to deal with him is throw him out of the house and pretend u never had this son and go on with your life and that is the best solution i agree completely.I tried to commit suicide to get better mental health treatment but it failed. The biggest problem is me i literally don't want anything at all i don't have any plans at all for anything i literally spend my day doing nothing i browse the net if i get really bored.My mom also believes depression is just a farce other people have been through worse and survived he reminds me of it all the time but my mother works all day in a job customer care where people swear at her... she had stage 2 cancer and she survived also her heart works at 85% capacity all these suffering should have been enough for her to kick back into life. Infact instead of changing my way i developed a new bullshit feeling that my loved ones will die and i will be homeless and eventually kill myself this thought comes to me all the time randomly. My father lives a new life he didnt even talk to me when i killed myself sometime later i talked with him and he was like why did u do that and then never talked to me again i can't hate him either he has had multiple heart surgeries,diabetes and now it looks like he will have alzheimers too.When i made this account the first thing i did was delete the reddit mail u get cuz it upset me idk why? sometimes when crossing the road i think of how should i write my suicide help thingy.. i have show these things to the psychaitrist but it felt like they didn't give a shit. I for some reason was also upset my post would get deleted it made me upset why tho? who gives a fuck eh. Its been like 4 years since i went to a psych my mom clearly hates it and i can't overwork her.But the biggest problem is the desire for change from with doesn't exist nowdays i think only of suicide and it feels so soothing anyway i mean the world is a cold hard place that doesnt give a shit about and will swallow you whole in a instant unless you are willing to break your back with overwork you don't have a right to complain i feel i am so obese and so inactive and dusting off a bit of shelf is enough to  cause massive pain in the whole body i don't think i can come out of this stuff.I know what the answers will be too go to a psychaitrist, set small goals and complete them at a time, just go graduate it ain't that hard i know this will be the answers but they dont fuckin work for me and since these dont isnt it better to kill myself whats the fuck is the point of writing this no one cares especially me.. and why should anyone expect me its their life i fucked up too much i have too low marks i have no skills i am way too obese i feel like its to late i had to calculate my age and i hated doing it cuz it reminded me off my failure i was in the 5 year of my college i think i never went to college heck i even skipped some exams but i was still in 5th year such bs.To come out of all this i will have to rend and tear and claw and fight everyday i don't wanna do that i would rather die."

I thought it was a fluke.The next morning, my heart starts pounding that familiar (and awful) beat even though the room wasn't crowded. In the afternoon it started again in a large room filled with only 10 people :(I don't think I'll be able to handle Beijing, even though it's my life dream to visit the Great Wall.I am so upset with myself. I was aware that it would be uncomfortable to be away from my family in a crowded country where I don't know the language but I never even considered panic attacks on my dream vacation. sigh.....Edit: I was tearing up as I was reading the responses, thank you so very much for being so encouraging.

        "title": "Sleep and Anxiety issues",
        "selftext": "I first remember getting bad anxiety (and almost an anxiety attack) when I was told that mom and dad put an ad out for me in India about marriage. That prevented me from sleeping at night, aside from all also getting paranoid by sounds. It went on for an entire month. I would be up literally all night until 5:30ish in the mornings. The second time I remember getting bad anxiety and not sleeping well for couple of weeks was when I felt depressed working for the state in WV, because I was being treated unfairly by my coworkers. It was bad during the last stretch of job interviews, since I was ready to quit and leave! The anxiety went away after I moved and started my job.The third time I remember getting bad anxiety was when my bird, Gizmo died, although I think I was more sad. I have never been able to get over her death. I feel that she thinks I left her at the vet and didn't visit her during visitor hours, but I was trying to think logically (packing and getting ready to come down to va, instead of driving 17 miles back and forth to the vet in case if they made me come pick up Gizmo right after visiting her). Me not visiting her is, has prevented me from getting closure. I felt the closure with my grandpa, because I was able to see and help him. I didn't feel the anxiety due to her, but I felt subconsciously it was due to that. The anxiety got worse when I was ready to leave my then job, because again, my boss was being very unfair to me. I couldn't sleep well. The anxiety went away when I got my current job and started to sleep well again. However, a couple of weeks into the job, I didn't sleep well for a night or so and then it started a pattern of not sleeping well and having to rely on melatonin. This has been going on and off for the past 3-4 months.The past few weeks have been stressful with my grandpa and knowing that we were going to receive the call, just weren't sure when. Every morning and night the stress would come back, because of reading updates about him on the group chat. It made me worry and to expect the worse about him. When I went to India, I didn't sleep properly there or on the plane. I came back and took melatonin for 2 days to prevent staying up at night due to jet lag. After he passed away on Sat, I slept for awhile that night; probably from all the tiredness. I didn't sleep too well on Mon or Tues and that could be due to the jet lag. Then when I heard about my grandma not being well, I started to stress about her big time. Every time I hit the bed, my head felt so heavy with the tension headaches. I would lay in bed for a few hours before falling asleep. I think I slept for 4-5 hours on Tues night and Wed night. I even took 2 melatonin on wed and the stress completely wiped out its effects. On Thurs, I took nyquil and that still took me 2-2.5 hours to fall asleep and I had to sit up so my mind wouldn't stress about falling asleep. I even listened to my meditation app.I'm not sure why my anxiety with sleep has gotten worse. I don't want to rely on pills, or even melatonin. I had even changed my workout schedule to the evenings/night so I could feel tired before bed and that seemed to help for a while until after coming back from India. I'm thinking I may need cognitive behavioral therapy.I think losing Gizmo had a profound effect on me. She was everything to me and I lost her in a blink of an eye. We recently lost my grandpa and even though it was his time (he was 90 years old), it's still sad. Now, I'm worried we will lose my grandma from a broken heart. Losing my grandma, will probably feel like losing Gizmo for me. Her and I are so close and I consider her to be my best friend. I don't blame her for wanting to not live, especially since this just happened 2 weeks ago, and she is getting old. To top it off, this kid that lives above me with her parents runs in her apt, causing us to hear the vibrations and feel disrupted--it also increases the anxiety and stress for my boyfriend and I. We've complained each time she has done that, and it has gotten a bit better, but we will see if she starts running before 8:30 am tomorrow, because since NYE, this kid has been waking us up on the weekends and we aren't even sleeping in that late.Overall, I'm fine on the weekends, but the anxiety is worse the weekdays, although I'm sure right now with the events that just took place I'm not sleeping to well in general. I put stress on myself for getting a good night sleep, because it makes me feel good--it's the same reason why I work out. When I lose a good night's sleep even for a night, it starts a cycle of not sleeping properly. I hate this and want to be in control of my thoughts, since I think my issues are purely psychological. Any advice will be appreciated! Please don't post anything negative here either, if you have nothing nice to say.Thanks for helping out!"

I struggled last semester with anxiety and panic attacks really bad and over Christmas break everything went away and I got back to normal me, but now I have symptoms like when I go to eat just about anything I feel nauseous, which is the main problem I've been having. But sometimes I'll be in class or in a meeting at work or something and feel trapped and then I get nauseous there too.Has anyone experienced anything like this? I like to meditate but it's hard for me to do it in my room because once I meditated on a cushion I could never go back to sitting uncomfortably and unfortunately I don't own any cushions like the ones we have where I do group meditation. It's really shitty and interfering with my personal life now, I don't know what to do, I just wanna be able to eat and stuff again. The weirdest part is I can eat shit like junk food and drink beer and all that, but if I go to eat something like a burger or some eggs I'll feel sick."

It's how you carry it.&gt; Put the ball in someone else's court.It's what I look at when I'm experience an anxiety episode induced either by work stress, or my hypochondria.It helps me regain my perspective. A lot of these are thought-terminating cliches, which are effective in helping, well, terminating thoughts. Including anxious ones.These are little phrases and sayings that mean something to me and have an impact on me, but maybe for you it's something else.I just kind of read through them and whichever ones apply, apply. It keeps me kind of calm. I continually add stuff to the list that I think will help me."

I have been on the news I have won so many awards and scholarships and was the editor in Chief for my college magazine  and I help in running the financial taxation and now the executive functions of a small business.I didn't get the marks to get into the management university of my choice again. It's not like I have failed but I just didn't get good enough. I live in India where even if you get a 99.98 percentile you can't get into a good college. Not because of the exam of the exam but because most people here could not keep their fucking pants on. But regardless of my rant and all I feel like shit and until I don't get the scores I don't know if I will ever forgive myself. Sometimes I believe I'm being a leach. And I'm honestly scared if I don't get my MBA entrance exams stuff sorted out I will be overlooked in life. Sometimes I wish all these issues I have we're due to the fact that I fucked up so that I can understand them better and work on myself.I know I have done and achieved a lot and I have failed a lot but my anxiety attacks came back and I just can't think straight. People of reddit, am I being a fucking pussy and do I need to grow some balls, should I need to book more appointments with actual help or whatever please I need suggestions from anybody to understand what am I doing wrong ?"

I have been left by my wife as my marriage broke down almost homeless. Did not have a job cause was suffering from severe anxiety and seizures at least once or twice a week for nearly 12 years. Slowly then I moved into a shared accommodation. Got a casual job. Even then I was not giving my self credit for that cause I was getting calls daily from my mom and sister from India as I live in Australia. I was under the allusion that they are doing everything and I am doing nothing. Then as luck would have it doctors found the cure for my epilepsy last November and my seizures and anxiety started to reduce. But I was still mentally dependent on my family. I still was not realizing that nobody is with me I am doing it all alone. Its only me who rose from ashes. It was me who was living on government grant and then slowly started rising the ladder and then had a job. It was me who was doing it. Now Just a week or so ago it just came to my mind that wait a minute why is everyone calling me strong person?? Then I realized hey nobody was with you for last one and half year you were all alone. They were just on phone. you did it all by yourself. you suffered it all alone. Even this realization that I did it all by myself nobody told me I worked it on my own. Today I am feeling so good and so much confident.    "

I was really worried about this when I heard this and still whenever I hear this, I feel a little depressed. He suggested some heart medicine and I requested him to delay it. He relented on the condition that I should exercise everyday for an hour and sweat like anything. I really don't want to be on meds as before this I have got off one year of anxiety meds and therapy. I really don't exercise and feel even bad about that coupled with the strange pressure I feel in my brain/head.

I can't graduate because i don't know anything about any subjects also it\u2019s been 7 years since i ever studied anything so i almost know nothing.I spent my life  dreaming, sleeping, not doing anything at all, tv, computer games(playing the same ones 100 times). i never played any online games even if played them i never made any friends there, many online communities i only browse them never post on them because i am afraid i fear a backlash.I am afraid to go anywhere and talk to someone in real life i am afraid to interact with people i have gone all the way to places but i could never enter as something held me back(it was me).I also have a grandfather who i love very much but he is a non-sensitive person this is not a critisicm of him he isn't emotional he is a practical i frequently think of death even if he does a simple cough i get so upset i feel like killing myself that instant i scream to myself i don't wanna see his funeral nor be in it, i am actually soothed by the fact if i die before him i won't have to see any of that that is generally so soothing whenever i got anxious about him i would do stupid shit for example i cut off the skin of my feet so much of it that it hurts to walk. Yes I know what will my family think but I don\u2019t care.My mother loves randomly telling me she won\u2019t look after me won\u2019t give me any money, my father doesn\u2019t care if I am alive my uncle is even worse version of my mother and he hates my mom as well.I have to gone psychiatrists but it failed I been to many but they just prescribe you medicines and do nothing else they don\u2019t care if you have side effects because of them. I even did a suicide as a cry for help but it didn\u2019t do anything.  Nowadays I think about it a lot but if I tell it to my mom she will go into a abusive blackmailing phase she is basically telling me fuck off I already have enough problems. My dad didn\u2019t come to the hospital when I killed myself so there\u2019s that. Honestly I am not blaming anyone I know I am to blame I didn\u2019t study when everyone studied I didn\u2019t do any physical excersices or workout when other people did I honestly know I will kill myself but I its just when I know I can\u2019t change myself I have tried and failed and with so many damn distractions its feels impossible. Everyone in my family has their own problems they are not to blame and I know only I can change myself but I don\u2019t think I can I have lived my whole life with someone holding my hands. I have to do too many things I don\u2019t think I canIf I post this in suicide watch they will tell me don\u2019t kill yourself If I post it in depression they will till the same and probably go to a psychiatrist if I post this in a improvement sub they will tell me same and stuff like only I can change myself and the world doesn\u2019t give a shit about anything so either do it or don\u2019t whats the point of all this I can\u2019t go to the psychiatrist because I don\u2019t have any cash on my own and my parents don\u2019t wanna take and nor do any relatives or neighbours. I am really repulsive and repulsed by myself its not a image issue I think I am too behind and I really will have to break all my bones to catch up but I don\u2019t think I can."

You can find a song that gives you a connection and your not the only one.  Theres a band in Auatralia called British India,  they have a song called i can make you love me. There is a lyric in there that goes \"you know what they say you cant help but love the dead\".  Its just nice to know there are other people out there going through the same trauma.

        "selftext": "I've been experiencing what I thought was heart arrhythmia, sleep apnea, or anxiety/stress related chest issues for the past four months. I have never experienced these symptoms before in my life and suddenly they started happening so I immediately assumed it was a heart issue. I'm a self-diagnosed hypochondriac and also pretty sure I've had an anxiety problem most of my life but until recently it hasn't been keeping me from living a normal life.I went to the hospital on Saturday for most of the day and got almost every heart and breathing test done under the sun and the final result was...everything is normal! Everything is perfectly normal and the cardiologist told me it was due to stress that I was experiencing these palpitations and having a lot of trouble sleeping. Hearing the words, \"everything is completely normal\" was the best thing in the world. I didn't care I had to spend around $80 to get all these tests (I live in India which is why it was 'cheap' and also a reason I put it off for so long and opens another can of anxiety I won't go into). Knowing that my heart is normal and okay was a huge relief. I'm sure some of you can relate.My next step is to find a good counselor or psychiatrist/psychologist, heck, I'm not even sure the difference between the two! Another thing I am worried that India does not have much of or good ones at that.I just wanted to share the good news of finding out everything is okay with my heart and my breathing. I think knowing this in and of itself will help me a lot in controlling the anxiety when it strikes. I love this subreddit and have been a lurker for a few weeks now, but have gleaned a lot of good tips and stories from all of you."

        "title": "Any college students that used their university\u2019s disability services for their anxiety?",
        "selftext": "I am a senior in college and have had anxiety since my sophomore year. I only recently found out that the university offers disability services to people with psychological disorders like notifying professors, organizational skills, and finding long-term counseling, as well as other accommodations. I was leery at first because I didn\u2019t want to be labeled as having a disability and I figured I had made it through almost two years without those accommodations, but now I wish I had because my work is suffering and all of my teachers probably think I am a slacker. I am worried that I will have to make a choice between them thinking I am a slacker or I am weak, and honestly given the choice I would rather they thought I was a slacker. Best-case scenario would be that they accept that I have a problem and try to help me, but I am not hopeful of this. I am planning to get a Master\u2019s degree from a really good university in the fall and I want to register for disability, knowing what I now know, but I am still not 100% sure. As of now, I have emailed a counselor for help and looked up the documentation necessary for an application. I would need a diagnostic report including:* A specific diagnosis stating that I do have anxiety* A description of current functional limitations* Information regarding medication (none)* Information regarding current treatment (will probably be only cognitive behavioral therapy)Have any of you used your university\u2019s disability accommodations and did they help you?EDIT: One other thing, the university wants a reason why no accommodations were provided in the past. Do \"ignorance of the resources available\" and \"I'm kind of a stubborn bitch\" count?UPDATE: I brought up looking into counseling options in my new college with my parents last night (nothing about applying for disability yet, or probably ever) and my mom went really quiet as my dad just blew up. He thinks that if I know that grad school is going to cause me stress and anxiety, then I just shouldn\u2019t do it and sit at home, where there is no stress whatsoever (that was sarcasm). His exact words were \u201cdon\u2019t taste poison just because you have an antidote\u201d (it\u2019s apparently a saying in India); I think that meant I shouldn\u2019t do things that I know will stress me out, like grad school, just because I have the option of counseling or dropping out. His reasoning is backwards\u2026I looked into counseling because I want to be able to do research and do my best work, and live away from home at my new college without having to worry about my anxiety causing my work to suffer. This way I\u2019ll have help and a support system, and it\u2019ll actually be a much better system than the one I have at home, where I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it. (Except, you know, millions of people on the internet.)They know the absolute bare minimum about my anxiety and depression, namely that I had it for some period of time two years ago, and the only reason they know that is because I failed two courses my sophomore year and back then they told me to get therapy. You know, because my grades were down. Apparently, as long as I am functional and able to do my work without breaking down my mental health doesn\u2019t matter.I think that this has convinced me that I do need to get a therapist. And to get a support system for myself outside of my head and avoidance techniques. I have a hard time talking about issues and getting personal with my friends, and with therapists, but maybe that needs to change if I can\u2019t talk to my friends or family about my problems. The person I emailed hasn\u2019t emailed me back yet but I am going to her office today to make an appointment."

        "selftext": "I don't know where to write this. I don't think anyone I know would actually understand this. So, here you go, reddit. I am a 28 year old Indian woman living in the US. I have been here about 4 years now.I have a weird kind of anxiety, I am just very worried about what some people think of me and how they'd judge me. Most of these people I worry about are people from my college during my undergrad. days. I was somewhat different from people in my class, had my own strange (old-fashioned) ideologies and perhaps appeared too stuck up. I also lacked any sense of fashion/style. And I often thought of myself as superior because I was different. But the fact that I never was among the \"cool\" crowd got to me quite bad.To top this, I got into a relationship with a guy who was 10 years older than I was and even got intimate. (this was a pretty big deal in India in my city, people who got to know about it were very scandalized) That relationship was all sorts of weird, once again. While it offered me some respite in terms of improving my self worth (wow, at least one guy likes me/finds me attractive!) , I was constantly feeling inadequate. I was not even twenty, very inexperienced about everything in life and had a terrible need for validation, while the guy was well traveled, could articulate things well and looked like he had figured his shit out. As I grew older (about 22-23), I realized how that guy was not really as mature as I thought he was and the relationship was actually stifling.Anyway, this whole 'uncool girl mixed up in scandalous behavior' was something that I couldn't handle at all, in college. Not that anyone asked me anything about it, I barely had friends, but still, I had this nagging feeling that people would gossip about me and laughed at me.I have actively avoided getting in touch with many of my classmates (they're all on my fb though) Now, I have moved on, I have changed in many different ways - I dress better, my ideas have taken a huge turn, I am liberal/progressive than ever before and am finally with a guy who is \"normal\".But then, even now, if I have to post anything on FB, just any thing, I get this picture of all of those people sitting in silent judgment of me and mocking at me. This makes me very anxious. I honestly, logically don't give a flying fuck about any of them. I don't care about their existence. But they still bother me because of this imagined superiority that I attribute to them.I am not sure what to do. I reorganized my friends' list to put them in a restricted list. I could remove them from my list, but that just sounds ridiculous and illogical.If you read this, I can't thank you enough! Thank you very much. I hope I can lend you a listening ear when you need it. I also appreciate any comments that you can give. Just a \"hi\" after you read this would make me very happy too! Thanks again."

People who just met me think I'm getting girls all the time because I can sometimes fake confidence with alcohol. I'm 22 now and I'm at the point where I have anxiety when I talk to girls. My anxiety and lack of congruence and shyness has actually deferred girls away from me. I had interviews to my dream jobs and my anxiety didn't let me be myself in the final round of these interviews. I was maintaining a 3.2 GPA, but this last semester my anxiety led me to cloudy judgement. I cheated on assignments and got caught. Ultimately I will have a cumilative of an under 3.0 GPA and could potentially get suspended or expelled. The ironic part is that the class was a 100 level class. I just have so much anxiety these days that I can barely be by myself without having a panic attack let alone do assignments. I basically feel like I just ruined my life this last semester because I couldn't control my anxiety.  That in effect has made me tremendously depressed. I've been struggling chronic back pain for the past 5 years. I've been going to Panama to deal with it by doing eccentric stretching and I'm not sure if it's working. I honestly believe that my anxiety is only making my body more tense and stressed. I have to thank God because I have parents and a sister who is incredibly supportive of me. Without them, I don't know if I would be alive. It does suck because my closest friends in highschool and college have been looking at me like I'm alien because I've been so weird around them. It's just been the biggest six months of my life that has ultimately been the worst 6 months of my life because I'm self sabotaging myself. It's frustrating because I feel like I have the power to turn this situation around and it's definetly not too late for me.But my anxiety is so crippling right now but I still can't justify that in my head for all my blunders this semester. Just decided to vent. Thanks for anyone who listened. I truly am not seeking pity from anyone. I know what's going on in Syria. I've seen the slums in India first hand. I've seen what real problems look like, and I truly want to help people in general. It's just frustrating because I'm struggling to be a regular person myself"

        "selftext": "Okay, so first I want to give a little background on my life with anxiety. I am a 22 year old woman now, and my anxiety started when I was about 14/15. I was in high school and was in incredibly rigorous college courses, as well as being involved in many extra curricular activities. Anxiety and depression run in my family and I had already dealt with depression for years. My first full-on panic attack was at my synchronized swimming pageant, where I collapsed prior to a routine that was particularly difficult (holding your breathe for extended of periods of times is very intimidating when you already are hyperventilating). Anyway after this incident, I was put on zoloft and xanax. This began a five year battle with what I consider addiction. I also developed an addiction to narcotic pain pills, which i think was mainly due to that 'invincible' feeling that opiates give you. I went on a school trip to India in the summer or 2009, and because of all the drugs I was on, I didn't have any anxiety at all, I had the time of my life. When I got back however, my addiction worsened even further (a lot of this was due to my mom becoming disabled and becoming an opiate addict and just not the mother I'd had before). Anyway, this ended up changing the entire path I had planned for myself after high school. I graduated with incredible academic achievements, the absolute top of my class, a dream student, but in reality I missed something like a hundred days of school my senior year due to anxiety, and was taking something like 16 xanax a day, 2 temazapan at night, as well as something like 60 mg of oxycodone a day, on top of zoloft, buspar, etc.. (this is a very conservative estimate to be honest, I was a total mess). I ended up losing over 40 pounds and spent most days in bed, but most people didn't realize anything was even wrong, and told me how good I looked because I was so thin.I had plans to go to college, and was being courted by the most elite universities in the United States, but obviously I was in no condition to go live on my own and keep up in such a challenging academic environment. My doctors didn't know what to do so they just kept giving me more meds. I hated myself, I hated my life, my friends were at school living the life I had dreamed of, and I was sleeping and crying and drugging my life away. I couldn't stand it anymore and wanted to move forward, so I enrolled at a very very good college that was also close to home, hoping I could do this. Well, the constant cycle of doping to do school, running out of medications early, suffering withdrawals, missing class due to withdrawal, and then the anxiety of making up so much work got to me a little over half way through the semester. I just broke. I stayed in bed for a week in my dorm room, not eating, not talking to anyone, not showering- it was the darkest week of my life. Eventually I told my boyfriend, he helped me move my stuff out and tell my parents what had been going on ( i had been lying to them and pretending I was going to class like everything was normal). When I got home I was even worse with my addiction because I was so ashamed and felt so weak and worthless. It was terrible. For about a year I did nothing with my days, though I did step up my counseling a TON, and was seeing many different types of anxiety specialists, as well as a spiritual healer who helped the most. I finally decided in Fall 2012, with the help of my family (my sister especially, she has GAD as well), that the drugs I'd been on for years were the reason I had ruined my life the past few years. I decided to wean a bit off the opiates and barbiturates and then went cold turkey. It was, by far, the hardest thing I've ever done. I wouldn't wish opiate and barbiturate withdrawals on my worse enemies. (Marijuana helped SO much though.) I had been doing A LOT of these drugs, so the withdrawal lasted several months. But i knew I had to do this to get my life back. By March 2013 I was the happiest I had been in a long time. I felt so alive and so calm, and invincible because I had survived the withdrawal. I turned 21 in April and I got my social life back, made new friends, got a new part time job, I was thriving. I have been thriving (and totally pill free!).Then, all of the sudden, a few months ago, I started getting severe panic attacks again. It started driving 2 hours on interstates to visit my grandmother. I've never liked driving, but in the past I was on so much xanax, I hardly ever had panic attacks while doing so. This was terrible, I was shaking and sweating for two hours straight and I really don't know how I survived it. Worse yet, when I got there, I knew I had no option but to drive myself back. I don't know how I did that either, but it helped knowing every minute I was getting closer to home. Since then, my driving anxiety has snowballed. At first I just avoided interstates, then just faster roads, and now I freak out just driving to work. It's just the fear of having a severe panic attack while driving, I am not afraid of crashing or dying, I am just afraid that I can't do this. I remind myself I am doing it, but I just hate it. This rebound of anxiety has now ballooned that I doubt my abilities to do anything without suffering panic attacks. I even have had attacks at work (and my work is the chillest place in the world) and at the grocery store. I have a trip planned to take the Amtrak to visit my sister in a month and a half and I'm terrified I won't be able to do it. I'm terrified I'll have a panic attack on the train. I'm even more afraid of the 6 hour layover in Union Station in Chicago. What will I do if I freak out?? I'll be stuck in Chicago, far from home, completely alone, with no one to comfort me or to make sure I get on the train. It's all I can think about, even though I know that's the worst thing I can do.To try to help myself, I scheduled an appt with a doctor who does biofeedback, as well as an appt with a doctor to prescribe me a small amount of xanax for the trip (which I had promised myself I would never take again, but what else can I do?). I have been doing yoga everyday, which makes me feel calm for the time being, but I'm still so scared.Sorry I really just needed to get this off my chest. I've been feeling positively insane lately. If anyone has any advice, or words of comfort, they'd' be greatly appreciated. I know I have it a lot better than I used to, I have a job, a social life, etc. and am working towards going back to school, etc. but I'm so afraid my anxiety is just going to take away everything I've worked towards.TL;DR-I've struggled with anxiety for 7+ years, and had dependence problems for the first 5 of them. I stopped all medications almost two years ago, but recently my anxiety has reasserted itself into my life. I  am worried about my ability to cope with this and am afraid I will lose everything I have gained the past two years. I need comfort and advice that (my favorite anxiety quotes) \"everything will be alright\" and \"this too shall pass.\""

I really am helpless now. I am 22 years old and a Indian.Somethings about me i am suicidal and have been diagnosed with depression which might be true or not but fuck that.I have been to 3 psychiatrists now and here is how it went.1st one)This was the worst one oflot all advice he gave was eat more medicine he increased my dosage randomly.  We found out that he was a greedy doctor who only made me go to a certain chemist and recieved a certain commission on it. My mother flew into a rage when she heard about that so my treatment stopped completely.. until we decided to go to him again he give some miracle pills idk i felt like i was flying i was ridiculously active and positive but what's this medication killed my appetite completely i couldn't even take 1 biscuit with a little coffee i would vomit. I loved this my weight was going down rapidly 20 kilos in one months until one day i went berserk i had a panic attack and i took every single cleaning agent mixed it and drank it and then drank a lot of water. This backfired however i started vomitting it back and their was fragnance my family suspected something and i told them i was rushed to hospital and had a stomach flush out or whatever. After you commit suicide they assign a psychaitrist to you and guess what this was the same doctor my mother told the doctor they will take them to him later and  called him andguess what he said he needs to keep taking the pills or he will kill himself again. My mother threw down the phone and swore to kill him if she saw him.2)This doctor i wasn't honest with him i was confused what to tell him and basically i told him i am lazy and i am the loser he agreed! told my parents i have no depression i am lazy and they must pay more attention to me but they didn't but this is not my mother's fault don't blame her 3)This time i went to a psychologist but she was counselor or something and eventually i ended up with a psychiatrist again  she said the same thing i have depression and gave me pills.All these pills do is supress my suicidal thoughts by a limit i had a raging suicide drive before not now.Here are some of the problems i face.If your teacher is teaching a subject i must pay full attention to it if even for a one minute i take a pause my mind is gone i lose control of it i go on a day dreaming parade some of this day dreams are frankly scary.They usually involve me being married, dying(disease,trapped in space, suicide,divorce....,having superpowers and in this case i am never the hero of the story.. but i am a badass the hero/heroine is someone else.If i am watching a video and if even a slight pop up or distraction comes up i will lose focus get angry and go to downloadhelper in firefox dl the video and watch it.I completely stop i mean like a discipline habit walking a mile in the morning,praying what i was doing for no reason to trivial reasons.I am starting to forget stuff like completely. This happened recently.I am an annoying person this isn't self hate i am annoying i type like i have a lemon in throat and i talk even worse i bring up irrelevant points and this causes my friends to lose interest and they take to each other and this upsets me and i literally go around somewhere sad and wanting to cry and sometimes even cry.Here are the important things.I failed college. I have no friends. I have no job or no job skills and i am in India this place is ridiculously low on jobs unless of course you want to be a slave at a call centre. I am doing nothing in my life like not a single damn thing i just panic,cry,video games,simple on a wet bed i am a bedwetter i am disguising however i am not like this one i want to meet someone i get cleaned up wear clean clothes,shower i don't have friends because i don't know anyone anymoreI am never able to convey my problem to a psychiatrist never i wander off Now my problem.What do you think when you go to a psychiatrist and counselor,psychologist? This will solve my problem this will help i will no longer be lazy and miserable now the change starts! fuck yea or something like that but me i don't i think nothing i don't even make a list what to tell to a psychiatrist i will go early and sit in the waiting room and i usually go first but if it isn't i will sit in the room and day dream.My post in sw http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ipmde/i_just_want_to_die_i_cant_fix_myself_and_i_am/ got one comment not their fault they have better and real problems to deal with but yea.I actually wrote this on adhd sub but i feared they will probably delete it because it breaks rule so i posted it here while replying to someone who messaged me on sw fuck i idk i think i have no future if i am like this."

Ups - makes me believe I can get there tool; downs - this might sound selfish, but I cannot escape the thought that \"it isn't as bad\". I just hope all those downs get converted into ups.I'm from India and recently (November-end) moved to a new city with a new job. This is the third city I am living in - home, then city A with job and now city B. I got my first major panic attack in city A and that triggered off a serious of horrible symptoms - younameit. Ironically, all of this came up when I was helping my then colleague deal with his bouts of anxiety. I underwent a course of betablockers after I found out that no, it was not a heart attack I was expecting.However, ever since I moved, I realise the symptoms are going down (and also understand that they may come back in a second - hope not). The most nagging symptom was perennially ringing feet. Gradually, the chest and jaw aches went and I can feel the ringing slowly disappearing. It's weird because work and city A had nothing to do with it. I loved city A and miss it so much. My job was also fun with a great boss and wonderfully friendly colleagues. But, I'll take this change with open arms. I am still coping up to the new city and the unknowns still give me the heebiejeebies. I just wanted to share that I have not felt better in a long time. I also have started to diet and excercise and lose some weight (after gaining horribly after an accident that left me bed-ridden and quitting smoking unsuccessfully for two months and half).I don't know for sure if this is foolproof, but perhaps if its possible for some of you to have a change of environment, please do so. It might help or at least lower whatever you are going through.I am going home tomorrow after some time for some days and am eagerly looking to meet my folks and friends. My folks still don't know about my anxiety and hope they do not need to from here on. I can also face and talk to them without much hesitation.Thanks for letting me talk. Hope by the passing day, things go better for you. As always, here's a tip: take a deep breath. Love to all. EDIT: tl;dr - I got diagnosed the middle of last year. Moved to a new city in November. Feel much better now. "

Most nights I get a good nights sleep. I haven't been without it every day for years. The only time I was without it was on an overseas business trip to India. Upon understanding the ease with which pharmaceuticals are procured outside of the US, I was able to remedy the situation after a couple of days. I've been on this shit for so long, that my mind runs in circles if it believes that its host has not gotten its 10mg daily dose. The migraine remedy treatment has had a slew of benefits. Fewer migraines, more sleep, and an ability to tolerate quantities of alcohol. Pre-treatment, I couldn't drink a glass of wine or a bottle of beer without feeling like shit the next day. Five years out, the only thing I have to show is poor short-term memory and the need to drink at least a bottle of wine or (in the summer) a six pack of beer or more. Upon telling my psychiatrist, she told me that I was abusing Ambien and told me that the Ambien and alcohol mix has caused an alcohol addition too. Now, I experience severe cravings. At 5:00 most evenings I get a severe craving for alcohol. I feel like there is no fix except alcohol and there is nothing that can stop me from procuring it. No matter what I am drinking that evening, I know that I must stop at 8:00pm or experience sleeping problems.All of this frightens me. even with Ambien, I can stay awake for hours re-numerating on a day's event. I may not fall asleep until 1 or 2 in the morning. My shift starts at 7:00. I am not a young man, I am in my late thirties and am not cut-out for sleep depravity. It's just passed 8pm and I've stopped drinking for the day. Two hours left to sober-up and then go to sleep using ambien. It'll be the same thing tomorrow.Anyone else have similar experiences? How did you break it? My physc has put me on a different sleep med and has suggested anti-craving medication. If you saw me, you wouldn't know I had problem Is there anyone else out there like me?"

Other days I can seem like the most outgoing and loud person in the room. The latter is usually the result of some kind of chemical influence - that is my crutch. I am in my late twenties, and the crutch has taken many forms. Early on in my adolescence it was alcohol, however as I get closer to my 30th birthday, the crutch has frequently been made up more of illegal substances than the socially acceptable alcohol.The one and only time I have seen a doctor regarding my anxiety was two years ago, after 6 months of daily use of a \"legal high\" available online called etizolam. This drug is actually prescribed for anxiety in India. Although it is not a benzodiazepine, it is in the same family, and has similar effects. When I produced a long list of my experienced anxiety symptoms I had written down for my GP, he immediately looked uncomfortable. I expressed my concern about the increasing withdrawal effects I was suffering from etizolam. He didn't know what etizolam was (fair enough), so he googled it. He asked if I had any pills left. I said \"no, I took my last one earlier today\". He looked slightly concerned for a second, before handing me a prescription for the beta-blocker propranolol. He assured me that this drug would block out any withdrawal from etizolam, and would help me feel less anxious in my day to day life. There was never any mention made of mental health councelling options available. Looking back, for him to research the type of drug I was taking and not suggest some form of substitute or tapering plan, and instead instruct me to go cold turkey, was putting my life and long-term mental wellbeing at risk.What followed were five days of the most excruciating withdrawal symptoms after stopping etizolam cold turkey. I couldn't go into work. I couldn't leave my flat. I couldn't stop shaking, let alone sleep. My terrified girlfriend came close to calling an ambulance several times during my more severe panic attacks. If you've ever gone cold turkey from a short-acting z-drug, you know what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, I had no idea this was in store for me (thanks for the heads-up Mr GP).Eventually I recovered, and decided to stop taking propranolol, because to be honest, it does NOTHING to help my anxiety. But I can honestly say that those five days were the worst days of my life. I feel my GP let me down and just prescribed me something to get rid of the uncomfortable conversation. So I stopped taking etizolam, but continued to allow anxiety to rule my life.Anyway. This post has somehow become a wall of text. Sorry about that (it's one of my many crutches doing all the talking).Fast forward to today. To deal with a high-stress job, I started using diazepam to deal with my anxiety. This has become a daily habit for about nine months now. I have been attempting to taper off for two months, however I am not prescribed the diazepam, therefore I am concerned that the sources I obtain it from contain inconsistent dosages, especially after some research online. I am also going through some very stressful life changes, and honestly I don\u2019t know if this is even an appropriate time to attempt a taper, even a slow one. I also need general anaesthetic for a shoulder operation which is desperately needed for a partially separated AC joint. I've been putting it off for months because I know that I would be a fool not to disclose my high tolerance to diazepam to the anaesthesiologist. Disclosing this prior to the operation without firstly disclosing it to a GP will, I imagine, lead to the operation not going ahead (correct me if I\u2019m wrong).So, TL:DR \u2013 is a UK GP likely to prescribe me diazepam if I present a tapering plan? My guess is not. Is an anaesthesiologist going to allow an operation to go ahead on a patient who is addicted to illegally obtained prescription drugs? My guess is not. Are the NHS likely to provide me with the counselling I need to beat anxiety in the long-term? From what I\u2019ve heard recently, my guess is not without being on a very long waiting list.To be honest I don\u2019t really even know why I\u2019ve written all this out. I can\u2019t bring myself to come clean to my girlfriend about this most recent addiction, after everything I put her through with etizolam withdrawal. She\u2019s got her own problems to deal with at the moment and I can\u2019t face losing her over this. However it\u2019s only a matter of time before we travel somewhere where I can\u2019t obtain diazepam and ruin the holiday with withdrawals.I\u2019m the only person in the world who knows about my addiction, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m able to discuss this with anyone. As soon as I lower my diazepam dosage, I become agoraphobic and barely able to interact with friends, who just don't have a clue why I might be behaving like that. I feel incredibly alone, trapped and guilty and I just want this weight off my shoulders."

A month met a someone (lets call him Liam) in class who had other friends that party. I met up with him and 5 other girls and guys last weekend. I knew I wanted to make a good impression with these people and pushed myself more outgoing than usual. It was succesfull and I made some new friends and my social life would make a 180. I was having the highest of highs in a while, or so I thought. Tuesday I ate lunch with Liam and he asks me \"Why were you being all anti social at the party?\" I said \"No I wasn't whatever. I had alot of weed to smoke (not true)\". I was feeling pretty bad at this point but when this saturday came around I contaced Liam (I knew he was with the group) to see if he wanted to hang out. He said \"Im eating dinner with fam\", I look at snapchat story and its him hanging out with the group. So now im in the lowest of lows again, vaporizing weed all day alone in my room. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDfSZ_6f4U (this is 100% me)I ordered some beta blockers from India so im hoping those will help. TL;DR The taste of a good social life and then being rejected makes you feel worse than never getting to experience it at all. "

This summer I'm going on a school trip to India and then I have an internship for 6 weeks afterwards. Then, I have to go home from mid-July through August before returning to college.The thing is, ever since I started college, I have a lot of anxiety surrounding home. My family sort of blew up (divorce) during high school, but I really love spending time with my family and I'm so happy when I'm at home with them. Though I had a really solid group of friends throughout high school, I went to one of those schools when everything was a competition--school, popularity, how many guys like you, etc. Now, whenever I think of my friends from home I feel empty and anxious. Either way, most of them will be in other cities this summer, but even if they were home at the same time as me, I know it'll be really difficult to see them. I just feel like I've grown really far away from the person I was in high school and I can't handle being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself and I'm not happy.So, I think I'll be spending a lot of time alone this summer. I know it's a chance to chill out, start therapy, do yoga, read, paint, etc., but my birthday is in August. The idea of my birthday coming and going and no one cares except my mom and close family members makes me so anxious. I feel like these big dates really reflect where you are in life, and if I'm alone on that day (meaning, not celebrating with friends), I know I'll feel like I don't matter and I'm easily forgettable.My heart is clenched I'm so anxious I feel like I can't function. I don't know what to do. /r/anxiety, if you have advice for anything, like summer activities, solutions to my issues, or how to deal with these underlying anxiety issues, please let me know**TL;DR: Will spend a lot of time alone this summer because I'll be at home and won't want to see high school friends. Really scared about spending my birthday (in august) alone.**edit: word"

He hasn't checked in with me yet-- probably because it's around 4:00am over there, and the hotel reviews for where he is staying say the coverage is spotty. But I'm still feeling worried and anxious and sad. Really, I think the first time I know he'll have reliable Internet is on Sunday, which is when he'll be staying with some friends. But I really hope he's able to check in sometime before then =/. Just wanted to post here and get encouragement from people who might get it.

Told her and she put me on wellbutrin additionally. and kunggggggg. was very good. Still pretty good. Last week I thought I would taper off the cipralex and began taking half-pill. whoah did I notice the increased anxiety right away. Was getting used to it, then had a busy week and I couldn't take the chance so back on the full cipralex, and back to feeling somewhat zombish again. That's when it struck. Don't take 1/2 cipralex, take 2x wellbutrin. Eureka! "

        "selftext": "It's my second year of college. I've always had anxiety, but other than being a huge obstacle to socializing, it hasn't hindered me in many other ways.My first year of school was great, and I was really excited to come back. But the combination of me having too much work and my realization that college has no meaning or value for me whatsoever (along with a number of other factors) ruined my mind. I was always anxious, sometimes because of something in particular and sometimes for no reason at all.I was talking with someone who is into herbal remedies, and I eventually ended up buying some holy basil capsules (Organic India). I'd tried St. John's Wort to no effect, so I figured I'd give this a shot, but I had very little faith that it would help.I was taking two of those capsules twice a day, and a few days after I started, I walked outside, saw that it was a beautiful day, and for the first time in a very long time, I felt absolutely overjoyed. I couldn't stop smiling.For about the next month, my mood continued to be much higher (though I still had my moments, of course). It didn't really help me to do better in school, but when I messed up, I was able to brush it off and not get upset. I felt grateful to be alive, and nothing could stop me.Then I started feeling worse. The anxiety began to return, and as it continued I decided to myself that I should stop spending my money on those pills. I figured the effects were probably all in my head anyway. So I stopped.Things continued to worsen, but I was still functional. At some point last week, I had a lot to do and found myself unable to do any of it. I felt totally paralyzed, and all I could do was sit and cry. I told myself I'd go to therapy the next day (for the first time). In my desperation, I took two capsules. Within an hour, I felt incomparably better. I actually felt *good*. I still wanted to go to therapy the next day, but I felt unable to because I wasn't really upset. So I decided that this time I'd stay on it. It was obviously helping.Unfortunately, the past two or three days have been the worst, ever. I am a total wreck, really miserable, and I can't seem to do anything, which is just fantastic, seeing as the semester is ending and all the papers are due and exams are beginning. I have made up my mind that tomorrow I am going to go to counseling at my school. Sticking with the holy basil for now, too.My advice to anyone considering it: give it a shot. I wasn't confident about it at all, but it has definitely helped me a lot. If it works for you, it will be well worth it.I'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine. Maybe I'm doing better than I would be without it. I don't know. It does seem to me, though, that when I am in a really terrible state and I take some, I generally feel a lot better within a couple hours.I think maybe a better idea (at least in my case) would be to take a lower dose (half of what I am taking now) and take more when I'm not feeling okay. It's something that you'd probably have to experiment with to see what helps you.While my experience has been mixed, I've been able to spend a lot of time feeling really good that I probably otherwise would have spent very upset. So I definitely think people with anxiety should give it a shot!"
