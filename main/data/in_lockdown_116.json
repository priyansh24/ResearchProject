I just want my life to be better, but it just spirals down 10 times for every time it gets better. so i wont really care about the grammar etc on this post as i am currently in a post breakdown mood i guess? idk im not about to bother with punctuations and capitalizations. Also this is a long post pls read i need help. The grammar isnt bad its just the punctuations and stuff lol.I have a mom, dad and an older brother who is 21. I live in India. Although our household isnt really indian, but a lot of things would be uncommon elsewhere i guess. So anyway, since i was really young, my brother would beat me a lot, not exactly in an angry way, but he would basically choke me, beat me, scratch me in the name of fun, and i would just cry and do nothing i guess lol. what else was i supposed to do? He was 9 and i was like 3. But the choking began later like when i was 5 or 7 or something but yeah. My mom and dad would see this, and usually just dont care. There is more, but ill get on to that later.My dad. He is probably the best out of all the 3, but i still dislike him, like, i would be sad if he died, but mostly cause of money and stuff ngl. But even if money wasnt an issue, i would still be sort of sad. But yeah. He has an addiction to tobacco, not smoking, but the one where you chew and spit it out idk im not well versed in this area. He is mostly problematic, because he just doesnt care, he used to, but now he doesnt. He just screams when there is an issue and goes back.My mom. She is an actual piece of shit. I dislike her the most. She is so hypocritical, so abusive, i dont even wanna talk about it. She is the one who teaches me, and i would get good marks. Ok ill get onto the main deal now that the characters have been set lol.I was born with a dark skin tone, and i was ugly. I mean, i still am lol. I dont remember much of my life before i was 4, and i dont remember much about my life till like 6, but i still rmember it somewhat. So, i was made fun of for my skin colour, not as a racist way, but i was called black insultingly in hindi as a way of teasing. I was called ugly, and i became pretty self aware at a very young age. My method to deal with this? To act like i dont care about my looks at all. Whereas in reality, i did. I knew from a young age that my looks were a bad first impression, and i could do nothing about it. This isnt even my greatest problem, but might as well start here. Ok, so second thing. I am really emotionally sensitive. now this is not really a thing i can explain properly, like, i wont get mad if a guy on the internet calls me stupid, its moreso when a friend does, or someone i care about, and when its front of some people and they laugh or something. So from a young age, i was made fun of for my skin colour, i would cry, i was made fun of for being a crybaby, i cried(lol). Then, eventually shit happens, and i wasnt sensitive enough to cry everytime, but i would cry over emotional things still. And that is still present.This is mostly everything that has led to my ruin, oh wait, more things lol.I \\*think\\* I have anxiety, i sweat whenever my teacher calls on me, no matter how much i know the teacher. And i also have a sweating problem lol but that doesnt really matter. But my heart beats faster, i get really nervous etc. Same thing when im talking to someone popular or someone i had never talked to etc. Its just not good. Also i have this thing, where i think, like, a lot. I literally fall deep into random thoughts jumping from one topic to another with a very weak link between them. I also talk to myself, talk about shit as though if i were a youtuber or something. This might be ADHD but idk. ok so that should be everything but i might add more info as i go alongHopefully, that covers all the prerequisites to understand my situation and make a based judgement.So, i was born in 2005. I have basically no memories up until 3 so skip. So, what i can remember is, my brother would beat me, my mom was very strict, she would beat me if i lost an eraser or a pencil, she would beat me if i was late, even by a minute for studying( I study according to a time table), and for various other tiny things. She would also beat me when i got hurt while playing, which is just..... ok. My mom was a sorta teacher, has a degree in maths. She takes tuitions at home, like extra stuff to help students.( and im ngl she is good at it even though her morals are pretty messed up). Ok so my dad was pretty nice back then, he was nice, would protect me from my mom, my brother and would basically give into buying what i wanted most of the times. As i grew older, the situation changed of course. My brother started doing more crazy shit, like choking and stuff, my mom and dad started caring less and less. My brother was hella smart about it. There would basically be no scratch marks or any sort of visible signs of injury. Whereas while trying to escape, i would scratch him a lot and whenever i would complain, he would scream about that. He has a liking for power. My mom knows that he beat me, but would think that i did pretty much worse to him, and i would get beat. OH FUCK, i remember! Up until i was like 11, my mom would beat me when we i screamed for help while fighting. Bruh. But yeah a lot of her actions didnt make sense whatsoever. My dad was the same as he was up until i was like 11 or 12 i dont quite remember but yeah. I diagnosed myself with depression (lol) as i was sad all the time, at like 10 maybe? and the online quizzes seemed to prove it although they were pretty fking generic ngl. So yeah. As i entered into my double digits age, i found myself being worse day by day. But before i continue, here is another factor! lol life isnt that linear i just have to say all of this if i want help lol.So, my mom taught me. In jr kg(Kindergarten) i got like 60 or 70 percent or something. oh yeah btw we measure in percent and not grades so keep that in mind. In sr kg i got like 85, and in 1st standard i got 90. Also grade=standard. Those numbers kept going up until 4th, where i peaked with 99 in my second to last exam then went to 96 for my finals.. From 5th standard they sorta floated at 92-93 for a while. In 7th, for the first time in a while, I got 89. I got below 90. I was devastated and my parents, obviously judging me only based on my marks, scolded me. Then in 8th.... oh boy...... i really dont want to talk about this year. The shit i did in school was deplorable to say the lease. But this is about my parents so i think i can safely avoid it. If you are curious, just... dont. Its not something like murder lol. its legal but its embarrassing as hell. But, in 8th i dropped below 90 pretty permanently, and i got a grand total of 79 percent which was just sad. I then went up back to 89.8 in 9th and now im in 10th with 90 and 89.9 percent for my 1st and 2nd exam. So yeah, just know that, the validity of my statements are measured with my marks being an aspect.Also, after like 11 yrs old, or 6th standard, my parents dropped the beating basically. but it still happened.Ok so now, this is going to be a mess, i have laid out everything you need to know, now im bout to go all outMy mom is a piece of actual fucking dogshit. She is so fking abusive. She knows that im emotionally sensitive and takes full advantage of that. She has this look that she uses which basically makes me feel guilty as fuck. She uses it to and a bunch of other sayings, like \"do you have any shame?\" \"Why dont you go die\" \" This is why your marks have dropped\" and various other things that i cant quite translate without losing its meaning. She uses these sayings to make me study longer(its so stupid cause i wont fking study if she makes me sit for longer. Ill just look at the book and be lost in my thoughts) and to make me do shit, like bring her glasses. She uses this in petty arguements and hugely guilt trips me. I dont remember exactly whats wrong right now as my mind is blurred with my bro and my dad so yeah. But my mom is my biggest problem, ill hopefully edit that in. But i think ill get bored or somethingMy brother is also a person whom i thoroughly dislike. He beats me a lot, makes jokes and acts as a friend, but when we get into a fight, not a physical one, but one where we are just screaming, he says so many things which are just plain wrong. E.g. on new years, he wanted to order pizza. I am extremely scared of covid and i honestly just dont want to take any chances. LIke i know the chances are pretty low, but just why risk it? Why does it matter? Its just pizza. Losing convenience isnt a big deal. So we broke into a fight, and i said no lol. So he called me a scaredy cat, there are no better ways to put it. Its a lot more aggressive and shit but thats essentially what he said. He said that if i grow up like this and go to a hostel in college, i will be bullied hard( which imma be honest, i am very well aware of it. I just cant do anything about it like, what can i do about anxiety and social awkwardness if there is no one to help me?) But it had nothing to do with this, like, I was scared of a fucking life taking virus, and just because you want some pizza doesnt mean ill risk my life, no matter how small the chances. I know its slim, but i honestly wish it wasnt like this. If he ordered pizza and only he got the virus, i would be glad to let him. But obviously itll spread to me, thats what i care about. And then, my mom said that a person who is very close to us(not to me. I literally have no one i care about. Maybe my 2 best friends but not even that much) is gonna come back to our city, as she had married and now lived in a different state. And there is actually just no excuse for that. You cannot tell me that a person who fucking travelled through 5 states or so in a train (check out indian trains lol. They are hella crowded) is safe. He wants to look cool and say a lot of dialogues, so he said \" She will come here no matter what\". I lost my shit. I started beating him, he beat me, we went toe to toe until we just stopped after like 10 seconds. He screamed at me, as i was literally not able to talk because i was gasping so much while talking, which happens pretty often, and he got a few statements about me being a piece of garbage and so on. Then today, ah yes, the fateful day. So, he has had the laptop 24/7 for a year now, and i could only take while he was asleep, and had to give it back to him whenever he woke up. Because he was 'studying'. which tbf he was, but not all the time. He was only studying 50 percent of the time. He jus watched videos in the meantime, which he could have done on his phone(which was also mine which he took because he broke his but, i dont rlly care about it since i just watched youtube on my mom or dads phone instead). He would literally wake up while i was taking the laptop, just so that i couldnt take it. I remember i took it for my classes because he was asleep, he literally saw me taking it, woke up, and took it back. Then later when i saw the history he was fking watching videos. That made me mad. Just know that i cried for a lot of these incidents lol. So, today, his studying is over, he was watching videos on his laptop, and i wanted it, because now he isnt 'studying'. And you know what happens? Ok ive started crying now lol. But yeah lets get on to the incident which sparked me to write this. I knoked on the door. He didnt answer. I knocked again and again and he refused to open. I started crying. My mom was telling him to give it to me. He didnt open the door. After like 5 mins of aggressive knocking he opens the door. He stands there looking dominant and says \"what?\". i ask for the laptop and he refuses. I burst in and just try to take it. He pushes me around. I struggle back. I take it in my hand. He threatens me. I refuse to keep it down. He then says such shit that im on the verge of going back in his room rn and stabbing him. See the thing is, Im not mad because he didnt give me the laptop. I mean i am, but that isnt what makes me cry so much. Its his lies. He says he was studying for a while, and he was just watching videos for like half an hour.(of course, he didnt have that book there 15 mins ago when i checked, and he shut the lights and closed the door 10 mins ago.) I dont care. I just wanted to kill him and myself. I ask him, why he didnt open the door then? his answer? \"Why am i obliged to answer you?\" Not even in our language but in english. Pissed me off so much. \"why am i obliged to answer you?\" huh? Im not a brother, im not a family member, just some random guy knocking on the door right? im not someone who said 15 mins ago that i will take the laptop in 15 mins huh? I wasnt the guy who didnt cry for the laptop for a whole year huh? And you know what he else he says during this shit? \" I just wanted to watch some videos for half an hour and then i would go to sleep. \"Couldnt you just wait? Didnt i wait for you when you had the laptop?\" OH WHAT A NOBLE FUCKING DEED YOU DID YOU AABSOLUETE PIECE OF HUMAN SCUM. YOU WAITED FOR 15 MINS ONCE WHEN YOU DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO STUDY FOR ME TO FINISH MY GAME OH WHAT A NOBLE KING YOU ARE! HOW STUPID AM I TO NOT WAIT HALF AN HOUR FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR VIDEOS WHICH YOU COULD WATCH ON YOUR FUCKING PHONE RiGHT????? alright now that i ranted, let me break down what is wrong with the statement. First off, it was videos which he could watch on his phone. He has taken the laptop from me for this exact reason. Second off, he has given me the laptop for an extra 15 mins like thrice maybe. Third off, he has scolded me for making him wait. Fourth off, he wasnt opening the fucking door. How would i know that he was watching only for 30 mins? Do you know something worse? he did this just for show. Just to seem right in frony of me and my parents. He was laughing when i was screaming at him to open the door. He was laughing up until he opened the door. OK then, he closed the door, i said i would beat him, he said jsut touch me, i pushed him and he almost fell, he slapped me and i almost got knocked out. My dad comes in, hears our arguement, and yknow what he does? Scold me for sleeping at 1 30 am. Wha? I have been doing that for literal fucking years. I am only 15 and I HAVE BEEN DOING GTHAT FOR YEARSSSSSS. Then i lose my shit yet again and scream, make a bunch of valid arguments which im jsut not about to write here ok? im tired bro. Then my bro chimes in and says that im making too many dialogues for my age(ah yes, my age. Just because im 15 means my feelings and opinions arent valid anymore, totally agree) Then he goes into his room and i go to my dad and tell him what actually happened. Of course he cuts me off in the middle, and brings up the sleeping late thing again( Note that i was crying so hard that i was gasping every single time i said a word). I make an analogy to his tobacco addiction he gets mad. He asks rhetorically \" whats your age?\" . I literally(no like literally) threw my hands in the air and was about to go. He didnt let me, i said a bit more, my bro came in, and i was like \"of course now this guy will come in this argumnet, support my parents and make me have a bad time\". He then says go and take the laptop cause it was better than listening to you. OK. I took it. And here i am. Writing a reddit post instead of playing games. I wanna die. Help me. my brother isnt even my problem here man, its my mom. I just dont want to expend my energy on writing. Im tireddd. I might edit it in if it gets enough traction. Ill also post this on depression and depression help. If, like, i get 1 reply only, and that reply is like \" Idk man, go see a therapist\" i stg. ok. thats about it. ill play minecraft because i only have 30 mins of play time as i spent 1 and a half hour writing this post wooooooooooooooooooooo"}, {"sno": 1, "created": 1609963583.0, "title": "Killing myself without hurting others?", "selftext": "I'm 25 years old. Have been with a gorgeous, wonderful loving girlfriend for 8 years. Have a family that's proud of me. Started a company with a friend and am making more money than would be reasonable at my age. I have accomplished multiple life goals I had. And since the world would be better without me, I am considering suicide. Feel free to skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you don't feel like hearing my story.I went to get psychiatric help not too long ago for anxiety. After being diagnosed with depression and redirected to the psychologist, I started going through therapy to understand the origin of my emotions. Essentially I'm a piece of shit manipulator. Grew up without a dad. My mom always knew how to make everyone do what she wanted, playing with their emotions and guilt, and I hated her for it. Now I see I'm probably worse.When I met my girlfriend she was dating another guy. She was really in love. But I wanted her, so I became her friend, got close, got her to break up with him and started dating her. Not once I considered anything I did wrong. She lost her parents recently and after a few days of being torn down, I was already tired of hearing her cry. It just bored me. I supported and comforted her, but I was screaming inside \"when will you get over it?!\". I now realize... She deserves someone better. And won't find him while she is with me. I'm now living with my GF and her sister. I started feeling attracted to her sister since we moved together. Became a close friend of hers and started flirting with her. She started flirting back, looked like she felt guilty, and suddenly stopped. I snooped through her phone and found out she is now dating some guy. From what I found out, it's a responsible, cute guy with a good job who is genuinely in love with her. When I found out I just wanted to beat the shit out of him. He is just who she deserves though. Maybe if he'd been a piece of shit I wouldn't have felt so bad... Oh, and he actually cried with her when her parents died even though he didn't even know them! Husband material! I have lots of friends, constantly reaching out to me. I ignore them most of the time. They seem to all care for me and think highly of me. They all trust me and rely on me. They shouldn't. I've now noticed how I discard people when they become useless to me. When I left uni, I stopped caring about the friends I made there except for when finding a partner for my business. Thinking about them just tires me out...And finally my family. I hate my mom for who she was with me, but mostly because I think I'm like her now. Probably worse. At least she loved her children in her own way. My brothers... Uni dropouts. One had drug problems, he needed my help with that and opened up only to me about his depression that led him to it. Fucking wimp. The other one I barely hear of anymore. He's just stupid. I realize now that I'm a parasite and a terrible person. I haven't disclosed all of this with my therapist and honestly don't plan to. I use people to my own benefit and discard them when they are not useful, all while putting up this stupid facade that I'm kind hearted and caring to make them love me and do what I want. I only ever cared about myself, and now that I see myself for who I am, I hate myself more than anyone. Everything is going great in my life and I can't love anyone or be fucking happy, just get a shot of adrenaline whenever I get something I want. After all I've done, I'd at least like to go out without causing more hurt. I thought I'd make my gf think I cheated on her or something (which would hurt her, but it'd make her lose her attachement for me). Then I'd write a letter saying I'm tired of this materialistic world and myself, and that I need to find myself spiritually. I'd buy a plane ticket to some spiritual country like India with my conjoined account with my gf, that she rarely checks, to consolidate the evidence. I'd say in the letter to sell my stuff (car and expensive things). Finally, I'd just pack a bag with 2 weeks worth of clothing for evidence, throw it in a clothing collection point for poor people and jump off a bridge a few hundred miles from here. This wouldn't allow me to donate my organs but would at least not bring the \"what did i do wrong?\" questions to those who loved me. Also I can't do a few of these things during COVID, but it makes more sense to me than jumping off a building or shooting myself. I'd only do that if no one cared about me... I wish that was the case now. It'd be easier. I've played with the idea for a while and think I may carry it out when I can. The world will be better off. Shit, I get a rush each time I think how smart I am for thinking about every detail like this. I really have no hope. The last views I'd have from the bridge would be awesome. I guess I just wanted to proof check my ideas here to see if there's any hole in my reasoning. Is there any better way to kill myself, really?"}, {"sno": 2, "created": 1609810347.0, "title": "Disassociation", "selftext": "Before starting here's the background - I'm a 17 year old kid born and brought up in India, I've never been a bright kid or especially good in anything. Not academically, in sports, socialising, talking to girls or anything tech related. I've never had any friends in my life and I used to sit alone at my bench in school as well, it was agonizing just watching teachers come and go and judge me because I'm the depressed and dead looking kid. They oozed hate upon seeing me. Hence I'm thankful for this pandemic.Never step foot outside my house for anything, I can stay in my room all day alone and be fine with it, that's just a normal day. Loneliness has become a forced lifestyle.Okay so, I've spent the last year battling suicidal thoughts and depression, I'm in a better place now than I was for years and I'm making progress. I've become more open to my flaws and I've spent the past month trying to get in a mindset to fix them.But there is too much I can't fix and can't accept for eg. My dead eyes, my dumb self, and extremely distant personality. This has caused me to have a seperate personality, which rejects the weaker one by enforcing superiority. It's hard to explain but to summarise my life has become a cat and mouse chase, as I go through my tasks and try to enhance my lifestyle bit by bit everyday I realise more and more how much of a useless existence I am and withing a short time the other persona takes over and tells me that I'm second to none and that everything is alright when it's really not.The persona doesn't act as a positive force in my life it just acts as a coping mechanism so I don't fall to depression and suicidal thoughts yet again. It's similiar to how one doesn't remove the blade from the stabbed part so the blood doesn't drain out the person causing him to die faster.I'm trying to look for a solution but as I mentioned I have NO ONE. I mean it when I say that I'm truly alone. There's not one person I can talk to about the years of anguish and pain that I've been holding in for years now. My family would just be anxious for me and tell me to move on, or they won't even care enough (believe me this has happened).I wanna get better and I don't want my darkness to be the death of me but I cannot drain if till I cross paths with someone who understands and who can help me by showing me the way or just being there at least.

She didn't bothered to even let me know that she's breaking up, she just blocked me and few weeks later a friend sent me a picture of her holding hands with a school friend of mine (that she had posted on Facebook). I talked to the friend(and mutual friends) to confirm things. It was painful, I felt physical pain when I saw the pictures. I shared things with my mother and it got little easier(later I found out she completely misunderstood everything). Then I got depressed.3. My Higher Secondary exams were within few months. I was depressed, I had no one to talk to, I couldn't focus, I skipped classes, I skipped mock tests. I scored very bad in Higher Secondary exams and other entrance.

I distinctly remember one day where my mother had to go to work with a purple bruise on her face. My mom suffered so much for us, yet over the years, she has quietly manipulated my sister and I. I am not ungrateful. I would quite literally lay my life for my mom but I noticed her manipulative nature very late in life. Fast forward to my 20s and I bagged a government job and I quickly attained promotions. I attribute that to luck. Because I know I didn't work much for the promotions. I know deep down inside. Now I am the head of the branch and I just feel like a fraud. I feel useless too because I am not street smart enough to counter all the lame excuses that these people make to get out of work. My incumbent did a great job and I am not able to reach 50% of what he has achieved. I hate going to work. Literally I just feel like getting into an accident on my way to work so that I do not have to deal with so many people all the goddamn time. I should have just prepared well and bagged another job but I have already wasted 5 years in this soul sucking job and I have turned too lazy to even study anything any more. I know I am royally fucking up my life but I am too numb to care about anything anymore."}, {"sno": 10, "created": 1608222062.0, "title": "I don't have the will to live", "selftext": "I've been depressed for quite sometime but only very recently I saw a therapist because I felt like I couldn't take it anymore.For some background, I'm from India and mental health is not something people are aware of and people think it's bs.

My therapist is amazing and next week is my third session. But yesterday I overheard my parents conversation and my mom was saying something along the lines of \"There's no reason for her to be depressed, we've always made sure she is happy. It's because we don't spend much money on her, she wants us to waste money on this. And since we beat her as a child she's making things difficult for us to take revenge. She doesn't have any other problem\"My family friend tried explaining my condition to my mom and she said Idk if she'll get fixed by this treatment but she's definitely is making life difficult for usI loved her dearly but now I can't look at her without feeling a mix or angry and said.

Yes . Was it good ? hell to say the atleast . I met a Girl , let's pretend her name is Alice , Alice is your typical cute , sweet , smart and out of your league kind of girl , but being kid I was I still wanted to talk to her , impress her and gain her attention , almost like Clout . well we hit it off we started to talk and stuff , fast forward to 2018 ,it's January and I know Alice very well , and things start to change , I start to see her in a different way... It was a crush ... and I decided to act on it , so one faithful day I told her that I liked her on the bus ( we shared the bus and class ) . Her response was nothing , no reply , I went home thinking had I fucked up ? did I make her uncomfortable ? I didn't know what to do .... for some reason I thought guys talking about their feelings for her would make her scared .. boy was I wrong , turns out she already had a boyfriend  , guess who ? turns out he's one of my bestfriend .. let's call him Chad , Chad here who is still currently my bestfriend , I have known him for almost 6 years now , I didn't expect this from him considering He just fucked the \" BRO CODE \" , I had told him \"Hey man , I kinda have a crush on Alice , will you help me out \" , turns out the cunt was helping Himself , Can't say I blame him , If you had the chance to date the hottest girl in your school with no strings or tricks attached , would you do it ... so I was broken I didn't know what to say , my own bestfriend had shafted me and I chose to keep quite .. through all this shitstorm I continued to talk , despite it killing me inside knowing I was \" never good enough for her and not to her liking \" ...

I died in 2018 my body just living on with my memories , I'm just the Husk of the person I used be , The best part I had no one to speak , to vent , fuck I couldn't even cry in own goddamm room , This spiral of Hell lead to one place \" Sucide \" , found a cool place to do it , thought If I'm dying might as well jump off a Building and get a good view before it all goes black.... but then if I wasn't such a pussy i would have died that day , but as soon I had reached the terrace of the Building , I start to remember the people close to me , My mom , My dad , what would happened to them? I didn't want them to think they were bad parents , I didn't want to waste their money on educating , feeding and providing me a good home ...I didn't want them to think they were a burden to me ... so I stepped off , unfortunately those memories , those demons never left , now in 2020 , it's only gotten worse by the age of 15 ,I done weed , vape and probably smoked 25 cigerettes which you might think is \" ehhh not too bad \" , I live in a Backward Country  , people younger than me have substance abuse ... But Alice on the other hand , guess what still in my school , is this a Cruel joke or something ? Does God think I'm his Sims character just to be tortured with FUCKIN constant bullshit ? idk what to do at this point in my life ..... I'm drowning , I'm Choking , I'm Dying....Now I'm changed person , Alice she changed me , not in a good way though , She taught me to never expect much from any person ... , As for my mental health , ehhh demons are still there , banging on door waiting to be unlocked .. waiting to haunt me again .... fulfill their wish of finally killing me ...

Tried Tinder/Okcupid/Instagram - still alone and lonely + started working from home - my mental health is getting worse - long post", "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I need to share something... **About me:**I'm turning 29 at the beginning of 2021. I've moved to UK for studies and for a better life, so I'm not planning to go back to my home country. English is also not my native language. I'm working in a large global company making above 3000£ per month which I think is quite good for someone of my age. I am 6 feet tall, fit - working out regularly for years around 3 times a week. So I'd say I am relatively good looking, educated and have a good income. **My story:**For the past 4 years I live alone. I am staying in a house share, but never met anyone here with whom I could get along with mostly because these were people who had came to London temporarily for work and left after few months + most of them were much older. So it was fine to chit-chat in the kitchen sometimes but that's it. At my company I am working only with males (mostly in their late 30 or 40+, it is very rare to see a women of my age in my office(floor), so I have never had a chance to meet any girl at work. I always thought that at a company like mine in London I will be able to meet with someone but unfortunately I was wrong. After 3 years I still have a contact with same age group of people who are mostly married and with kids and now  WFH kicked in as well. I'd like to meet someone who is similar in terms of career goals and education level.**My dates:**Since I felt lonely I stared using dating apps. It's a pain... but I managed to date few girls. First one was a nurse, she was okay but what was weird; she was carrying everywhere her best gay friend, and she was mentioning him very often(i have no problem with gays), once we were on a date (maybe only  I thought I am on a date?) and that guy just joined out of nowhere at our meeting, so awkward... all in all... it didn't last long.Another one was a student from Asia. I really like her, she came to do MBA, she was educated and intelligent, overconfident but she also had two faces... that other one was drinking and all that stuff. She had a lot of alcohol and weed at her place. Every weekend she was getting drunk, smoke, going to a night club etc. for me it was a bit too much but anyway I had a chance to date someone whom I was into. It was fun but one night she was doing a birthday party so she invited her friends and me as well but she asked me to pretend we are not dating (we were for few months already) and I am just friend, it was soo weird and I didnt feel good about it. We all got drunk that evening.. she didn't want me to be close to her or even dance with me, so I was just on a side... and her other drunk friend somehow came to me and started kissing me... and without more details that how this relation finished. I met also with some other girls from Thailand and Brazil but it didn't work long term cause they were not speaking english well and we didn't have much common topics to talk about + they were not exactly what I am looking for but still it was nice to be with someone around for some time. **My online dates:**I also had few online girls which were lonely like me and were looking for someone on the internet. Just not to make this post too long I'll briefly say that they were from asia. With first one i talked around a year but she end up finding someone else in UK and got married(guy in his late 30).Another one I knew for almost 2 years, we met twice in India but at the end she told me that her parents forced her into arranged marriage, so it would be a huge disgrace for her family if she would call that off.  It hurt me for a long time cause we knew each other really well. We were talking daily. 4 months before her marriage we were on holiday together and slept together. She told me that if I'd tell her earlier that we may be together then maybe it could work. The third one was also from India but she found me on Tinder in London. I think she is even in worse situation than me cause she used to date a lot of foreigners in her country but she end up being alone and now she would like to start a family and have a kid but she has no one - we just stopped talking but again it was good for me to have someone I could talk to.Currently I am doing similar thing as above with another girl from Asia who has found me on instagram. She works in similar field as me, so there is always something to talk about and we understand each other quite well. We can't meet because of covid and she also used to date bunch of guys there but anyway... I feel I am wasting time as in the cases above and at the end of the day I'll just waste a lot of time talking with her.**Covid times:**Now during pandemic I try online dating again but it doesn't work really, got some matches here and there but I don't really like my matches. I found few girls on Instagram which I like but I am not sure if I could actually go on a date with someone whom I found on Instagram?I think scrolling dating apps and instagram looking for someone I could match with had negative impact on my mental health cause very often I feel disappointment, saddens, rejection. Unfortunately, I also developed a habit of masturbation which is sometimes few times a day if I am off work and I spend too much time on those apps.  I haven't slept with any girl for more than a year now and I feel like I am also missing that but I don't want to have sex with any random girl, I need to feel that connection with that person otherwise it is better to jerk off alone and move on with life. My other problem is 'Work From Home'. My company does not allow anyone come back to the office till April at least. I am only renting a single room so it is a madness sometimes. It feels like being in prison. I work from this place, I eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. I spend my weekends here... madness... before at least I could go to the office, meet people from work, go for a lunch together, drinks or some social activities after work... now it's no longer available and will not be for a long time. Since I live 30 min from central London, I was thinking that maybe renting a whole flat in central London would give me more opportunities to meet new people? Currently I am living in quiet area full of families with kids and pensioners not much is really happening locally.**My main issues:**I'd like to find someone long term and just move on with my life and career... all that dating thing is a huge waste of time to me but on the other hand I don't want to be with someone just of sake of having someone. I don't know how am I supposed to meet someone. Office didn't work and with WFH posture will become even more difficult. I saw on reddit people advice to join some clubs... but what I am supposed to join? Ballet dance club? I joined football club and yea it was male only.  I also don't have any friends of my age here, so I never got invited anywhere. People also advised to try clubs or pubs... but I feel going alone to the pub and talking to random girls is weird, especially that my english is not perfect and I also have an accent.I'd like to keep focus on my career and further education but all those dating apps, instagram and people i meet there are distracting me but if I cut it off then I feel like something is  missing in my life, that I have noone to talk to (it is quite often that I have a days when I don't open my mouth to anyone and just talk to myself in my mind).I don't know what to do with my life now... I have a good job, money... I am a bit scary that I'll end up being 35 and will be in the same point dating-wise. I'd  like to find someone around 26yo, so that the girl doesn't have that pressure on her that she has to have a baby very soon. I am worried that it may be a case if I meet a girl in her 30.Since you already know my past... the other issue is actually talking about that to a new person which I met when she asks about my social life cause as you can see it is weird. I don't know how to change that. All that makes me feel more and more overwhelmed and depressed. There is also no one I could share that with cause people would think I am freaking out here and also I am sure that if I'd share that with someone that person wouldn't keep it in secret.What I should do now with my life? I am stuck... sometimes I feel maybe I should move to Asia where more girls would find me interesting.. I really don't know. &amp;#x200B;Thanks if you read till the end. I'll appreciate all feedback and advice. Maybe some of you were in similar situation at some point in your life."}, {"sno": 13, "created": 1607816555.0, "title": "My mind cannot process anymore", "selftext": "I've been in love with a girl from college we've dated since the past two years and now we were looking forward to get married, we both are from india and it's a little culturally regressive atmosphere here.

But I for some twisted fate decided to ask her to get her parents consent. There's too much trouble here if you just run away. She approached her family and they didn't agree (duh) it's been more than 4 months there's no progress from their end, no she's captive there and they've threatened that if you go the mother will die of shock because she is a heart patientI've been patient for this time, she tries to talk to me daily through some or the other social network site , just texts, they don't let her call me or talk to me. So for the last week I've been asking her to push a way through, to do something atleast, talk to her family about your wishes or just run away when you get the chance but she says let's wait , I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it two days and so on , i mean she was procrastinating.

Being small and wanting to complete my dream i studied studied and studied always was a bright student with good grades i had learnt abacus to increase my calculations speed and even stood all india rank 3, two times doing it. Then came the 10th got a whooping 10 cgpa. Was in the right direction to complete my dream.But you know what there were two blunders which happened1. I didn't know what was my passion or what i wanted to do or in which field i wanted to go into i didn't knew what i want to be good at from childhood i was told to study and you will be good.2. My family is not financially stable and is really conservative something like my dreams were laughed off when i told it to one of my family members she said this to me-\"Don't set you eyes too high because if you will fall down with face forward you will never be able to show your face others.\"\"You are not from a developed country like the us or uk where people get choices of what they want to do in their life and neither from a rich family you don't have choices to make because you can't become a failure in an attempt to make your dreams come true.\"And that's when all the bad things startedEven securing 10cgpa I didn't get admission in the top school due to high fees and got addmitted into a underlevel school and from there it keeps on getting worse the subjects i was taught and the exams i gave didn't showed any results because I didn't had any interest in them i used to study day and night with tears in my eyes to get good grades but never got them everytime i saw my marks on paper i cried and hoped that i will work even harder but i didn't happened and then on the report card day it showed 7.2 cgpa. I know that day i cried all day in my bathroom because i didn't wanted my parents to listen as they were doing there best to support the family. Every day i used to cry and hoped that it will get better. Tomorrow will be better day after tommorrow will be better the next day will be better but nothing changed nothing.I prayed to god what i had done wrong ?I never bullied anyone, never harassed anyone, never beated someone, never made fun of the unfortunate, never sexually harassed then why i am feeling so horrible why? Crying everyday with no one to talk it feels really bad i dont know what to say about this feeling i dont want to feel it anymore I can't see my dreams which i made as a kid i cannot go to the school because of low income of my family why? Going to a tier 3 college is not what i dreamed of and suddenly one day my little sister asked me this-Bhaiya (big brother) why have you got so serious you never laugh and smile?And then i realized that i had lost my smile over these 2 past years i dont how to say this but i was always a cheerful guy always smiling but,  but i just don't know the smile which i had has faded of and vanished i dont feel anything now its like i am physically dead the hope which i had for these 2 years that tomorrow will be better, it will get better it just happens to be an illusion i cannot tolerate this much pain now of beliving that something good will happen god will help,may be tommorrow will be a good day but it just doesn't happens. I prayed, had paitence, believed that it will get better even with tears in my red eyes whenever i cried quietly in my bath room or grabbed my pillow to not let someone here my sobbing voices.But the smile which wore two years back still hasn't come back the person which i had two years back still hasn't come back the dreams which i saw day and night still have not come back i feel horrible horrible it looks like i am worthless i am a fool to hope things i think i shouldn't had dreamed everytime i remember i burst into tears of why can't i change things why cant i ? I just want my mindset back like i used to have it 2, years before and rather than typing this with eyes full of tears i just want my smile and laughter back which i had  2 years before.

I’m not able to think straight. (Self-esteem issues aswell.)Let me tell you a little bit about me.I came to the US when I was 13. I had experienced middle school for 3 months. It wasn’t a pleasant experience but it was ok, I was a social butterfly then.. I could easily talk to people.. but I felt a little awkward as they were a bit more reserved. they had their own little group going on. It was hard to fit in. Then I thought.. “maybe it me. Maybe I’m supposed to be reserved.” Fast forward to high school, 9th grade is where I was awkward as heck.. I tried making friends but I was that awkward mingling with everyone. Now that I’m typing this I realize that guys being emotional is a bad thing. I have the tendency to connect emotionally with the person I’m talking/friends with. So when ever I talk to someone for more than 15 minutes.. it gets awkward.. especially if it’s a girl.. “do you like me?” Is what I get.. and then I give them an answer saying.. “as a friend, yes.” Because I had no intentions of dating in high school. I was just too busy with school work.. and my home liked was a disaster with my controlling parents that have high expectations. I stopped trying after that, I stopped trying to talk to people or make friends. Only friends I had was from my 4 year varsity tennis activity.  My life in high school was, go to school, come home, finish homework and play video games until midnight. Now the topic video games. That was the only outlet I had to any social life. I feel like I ruined any (if I had any) social ability. I was hooked to video games until January 2020. (Schooling was great, grades were mostly A’s and B’s)My parents left for a vacation in January, which gave me time to think about myself and reflect. JAN 06 2020. That was the day I said fk it to video games and got a gym membership. I paid for 2 months of personal training.. to get me started. My personal trainer was like a father to me. I told him everything I was dealing with while trained. He really helped me with my styling and grooming choices. I lost 40lbs in the past 12 months. Built a good bit of muscle. (I was chubby before I started working out.) from the moment I started going to the gym.. I had that hunger on making myself better and ready for social connections. I started working on my insecurities.PRESENT ISSUES AND ISSUES IM FACING AND TRYING TO CONQUER.Im 21 M, 5’6, big forehead that looks like a receding hairline but... it was like that from childhood. (RACE: INDIAN.)I realize that I’ve developed social anxiety.. my palm get sweaty when I try to talk to people for the first time.. but it gets better when I talk to them more. I’m reading books about putting myself out there more. But covid so it’s hard to make social connections.Depression: the only family I though would have my back and encourage me.. my dad, mom, both side grandparents. They point out all my flaws that I can’t fix just pushing me 10 steps back when I’m working on myself. It hurts a lot. I stopped talking to my grandparents as I want nothing to do with them anymore. My grandfather was in the hospital and I talked to him once, he criticized me even when he was on that hospital and I really felt a slap to my face. (Call me Ahole but i didn’t want to deal with all the set back.) I stopped talking to him.My life is miserable. Controlled like a puppet and I’m not going to give in any longer. I stopped talking to my parents aswell.. I just come home and lock my door.. it gives me to more time and Space to wager my options.I have 2 options.1. Get a job here in the US and move out of my parents house, fall in love.. and see where it takes me.2. Be daddy’s and mommy’s b**** and move back to India to marry someone I don’t have feelings for.I personally like option 1.. let’s just say it also acts as a revenge for them always trying to point out my flaws. But I genuinely want this (not just for the sakes of revenge.)But here’s the problem where my anxiety spikes.. who’s gonna love me? I’m short! My hair isn’t that great! Let alone I’m Indian! My race has been my biggest insecurities for me. I don’t think I’m attractive enough. Due to my family.. I don’t trust people that easily.. but when I do..

Sorry I am bad at writing and I tend to ramble for a while. I am a 21YO M studying Medicine (to become a doctor). I started studying Medicine in 2017 but failed the year (first year of freedom, sort of thing), so I had to repeat the year. When I had to tell my parents, both of them got annoyed and angry at me for failing a year (I received a 54% with supplementary exams but the exam cut off was 56%). My parents are from India and they still retain the mindset regarding education (everything is a competition and people look down on people who fail). I have always wanted to be away from my parents (for reasons I don't want to go into). I study in a different state (I am 2000 km away from them) and I always make an excuse to be away from them for as long as possible so I can enjoy myself before having to return to them and become someone different. For example, I purposely picked an elective subject that made me come back to university in January/February, which I enjoyed and made a few more friends (this all happened before COVID-19 lockdowns). I am always friendly and I know most people in my year by name. However, I use to have about 6 people I trust when I am going through a lot of shit and need some advice/talk to someone. When lockdowns went into effect, I went back home (as all university classes went online and my family wanted me back, against my wishes obviously). I was with family from March to June at home in Vic, before QLD was implementing new border measures for Vic. When I was down in Vic, the few things I enjoyed were driving early in the morning to pick up bread from the bakery early in the morning, driving in and out of the town, cooking and watching YT videos. Anyway, I got back into QLD with a few university mates (we called this \"Race to the Border\") 1hr and 30 mins before the new changes were being implemented. However this semester I had started consuming more alcohol than I had the years previously. When I get drunk, my depression and anxiety tend to get worse, especially with the negative self-talk. Sometimes I would just bottle them up, but when it gets worse I messaged a few of my \"trusted\" friends. During one of these episodes, one of them said I should go to the Emergency Department (this was at 1:00 am on a Saturday). The doctors told me it was good I came in and didn't self-harm (I do have a history). Anyway, another friend told me to see the uni therapist which I did and still do (as it helps a bit). However about one month ago, I was getting drunk and my depressive and anxiety episode triggered again (the first time in a month). This is when I lost 3 of my 'trusted' friends, telling me to not contact them again with a few harsh words from one of them (she was also drunk at a party she was throwing at her house). I only contacted one more of my trusted friends and she was supportive, even asking me how I was feeling the following morning. Anyway, after this, I didn't consume much alcohol as I needed to concentrate on my studies but I started bottling up my emotions again. (I do understand that the 3 people who told me to not contact them were probably doing it for themselves as it can be very draining)Today, however, I was feeling quite lonely while studying. Normally I don't feel lonely but today really hit hard which is why I just wrote out this wall of text. I have not contacted anyone as I am scared of breaking more friendships (I don't leech off people, if any of my friends asked me for anything, I would try my best to do it/help them, no matter what it is, I would still do anything for the 3 friends that told me to basically f\\*\\*k off). At the moment, I am feeling like a disappointment, worthless, pathetic and tired. After this, I will probably just sleep it off and start my day again with trying to study for the exam. Also, I have paid for 2 tickets to attend 2 'End-of-Year' events but right now, I am questioning whether I should go to them. These events are occurring on the 13th and 14th of November (after my exams finish).

My dad took him home and we decided to take care of him until he was ready to ride the world. We named him Shiva. We made him a small bed using cotton and warm clothes. In just a day he was jumping around out house but he'd barely eat/drink anything. I got a dropper for him to feed milk, he'd just drink 3-4 drops and done. He'd sit on my dad's foot and roam around the house, he sit on my shoulders while I caressed him. He was most attached to my mother, he would find warmth in my mother's palm and would always curl himself in there. I was really fun having him around. A week passed and everything was pretty fine, I searched for some articles on google about taking care if a squirrel. I used to follow all the necessary steps. But one day he seemed tired, he'd barely eat or drink, mostly sat in my mother's palm whole day while my mother trying to feed him. I searched for some more articles about his condition but couldn't get any help. We decided to take him to a vet. There's only a government veterinary hospital in our town. Basically, an old government building with just a hall containing a vet and an assistant to him. My mother and I took him there. As soon as the vet heard it was a squirrel which was sick, he looked at his assistant and both started laughing. The assistant literally said \"Kya hi bachega\" while both were still smiling.  None of them even touched Shiva and concluded that he'd die. They didn't give any prescription or any kind of treatment to the tiny life. My mother was crying on our way back to our home. I researched if a small dose of paracetamol could be given to him and found that we could. We gave him the lightest dose of paracetamol. By evening his condition worsened. He was now unable to move his limbs, his eyes looking upon my mother while she was crying with him in her palm. It was one of the most sad moments I've experienced till now. The emotional bond which was made between us and him in just a few days was strong and no one could hold their tears, my sister who lives away from home for studying was crying at her place even she didn't even meet Shiva. She had just seen his photos and videos we used to send. My father sitting on sofa, sobbing, couldn't see him in his eyes. We knew his time had come, any minute we could lose him. My mom, still crying, started to chant Mahamrityunjay Mantra hoping that he'd survive or attain Moksha. It was that moment when my mom had chanted the mantra exactly five times, his soul left his body. Our tiny little cute Shiva was no longer with us. We didn't eat or sleep that night. We just couldn't believe the fact that he was no longer with us. The next morning, we buried him in our backyard. We bid him our last goodbye. A tiny life was lost because of less facilities in hospitals in smaller towns of India. Despite being a district, it's still a town where I live. I know thousands of lives are lost everyday but when a life gets attached to you, you don't wanna lose it but when you do, either you could blame yourself or anyone involved. In our case, it was lack of facilities in our town. No private veterinary clinic in the town, the nearest is 300kms away. Not only veterinary, everyday when I open newspaper, I read news about accidents, firing, self harm, etc and in the end of the news article it's always \"Referred to so and so city\" and most of the time the victim loses his life in the travel. We don't want no public parks, we don't want no swimming pools, we don't want no fancy Gandhi squares, we just want better hospitals, doctors, nurses, compounders and everyone involved in medical department.[Shiva's Images](https://imgur.com/a/O2E0jzn)"}, {"sno": 26, "created": 1603936181.0, "title": "I can't make a decision...", "selftext": "I've (F26 from India) been suffering the impact of what I feel is ocd, depression, social anxiety and panic a lot lately.

I need this outlet.&amp;#x200B;I'm Indian and in my mid twenties, come from a fairly OK to do family, live and work in one of the major metros. Lived my entire life in Indian concrete jungles only (mom and dad moved around a lot). Financially, i do OK for myself. The money's not great but it pays the bills and i manage to save a decent chunk if it. I'm only doing this job for now cause it pays the bills. I don't think I'm depressed but just aimless and it's now driving me nuts. I know exactly why and it's quite simple: Pretty much all the stuff advertised to me as being associated with the good life doesn't appeal to me in any way: Fancy house, car, vacations, parties...... all that crap. Simply put, most aspects of life don't appeal to me. I'm not materialistic at all and only use my money for the essentials. I have no idea what to do with the rest of it. I've lost interest in everything and everyone. It's boredom rather than depression (do correct me if I'm wrong). I have nothing to aspire to. It's been that way for a couple of years now. I tend to try getting the real purpose of any venture or undertaking and it doesn't seem to get me anywhere. This has started to affect my social life. Almost everyone I come across thinks and talks about stuff that I have absolutely no interest in: career opportunities, cool stuff to buy, who partied where? who's making how much? who's dating who? Stuff that I simply don't give a shit about. I'm off mainstream social media, don't give a fuck about my LinkedIn account and have no clue what to do. Life does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I simply don't give a fuck about doing the stuff that regular people aspire to do: rise in your career, get married, raise a family, acquire a good reputation and retire rich. So I don't really see the point of living.  Though I don't have moments of extreme sadness with how my life turned out or I turned out or wishing I could have regular aspirations like everyone else,  I do feel like I'm just lying on a bed of roses watching life pass me by.&amp;#x200B;I keep fantasizing about disappearing from everyone and everything, moving somewhere far away maybe to another distant country, start living and working on a farm or in the hills or mountains or something. In a country where no one's ever gonna even think of searching for me there (if it does come down to that). My idea of the perfect life there would be to keep things extremely simple: Rise, work on the farm till the evening and then take a break for the rest of the day: watch the sunset and the scenery, do some drinking, smoke some pot and then contemplate the meaning of life until bedtime. Keep doing this with the hope that I die in my early thirties. The idea is to get away from everything and everyone and be close to nature or to simpler people and not rot in an urban shit hole where almost everyone's caught up in a dick measuring contest.&amp;#x200B;Except that I love and care too much about my family to actually do this. Plus given that I live in India where the ideas of status and reputation in society are so ingrained in you from the start, doing something like this would affect my parents reputation.

I am 18 years old and my brother is 20 years old. My brother and I were from India, where we were abandoned in an orphanage and where we were neglected and malnourished. My brother is the only biological family and the only blood family that I have. We were adopted in 2006 to a white American man and a Guyanese woman. When my brother and I were being adopted, we thought that we were going to have a good life, but what we really didn't know is that the neglect would not stop. Every year and every day of both my brother and my life, we have always said thank you and have always shown gratitude towards our adopted parents for giving us a brand new life. For giving us food, for taking us on vacation, for allowing us to live in a house where we can sleep on a comfy bed, and for having a tv, etc. Our adopted mom is narcissist, toxic, and manipulative. She has physically and emotionally abused us both. I remember when we were meeting our adopted parents for the first time, before going on the plane, I had started crying; and of course, this was when I was four years old. (all four-year-olds and toddlers cry). So when I was crying my adopted mom had dragged me into the bathroom and started hitting me and threatened to hit me with a comb. Not only was that the first time my adopted mom had started hitting me but when I came to the US and started preschool, I was crying and my mom took me in the bathroom at preschool and started hitting me. My mom continuously started hitting me for the stupidest reasons. So because my brother and I were raised in an orphanage, we didn't really know much. My brother and I have never seen a dog or knew what Christmas or thanksgiving or anything was. I didn't know what a bathrobe was, so my adopted mom got mad at me and started chasing me around with a clothes hanger, beating me with it. I remember when I was in 2nd or third grade, every time my mom looked at my homework for reading or math, she would get frustrated and start hitting me over and over and over again until I understood the problem. My adopted mom continued to hit us; she started hitting us with a belt and the vacuum wire. To be honest, I did call the social service but they didn’t do any good. They said in PA we kids are allowed to be hit/beat, as long as we don’t have any scars or feel any other emotion, which is soooooo bizar. My mom continued to threaten to kick both me and my brother out of the house.Ever since My brother and I were adopted, my parents have kept our birth records and all of our adoption files hidden in their room. They had bought a special lock that you punch in some code numbers that allows you to get in. (Just like how you dial a password on your phone). I am so curious to find out about my birth parents. My parents told me that my birth parents died when I was young. My biological mother died when I was just born and my biological father also died when I was just a couple of months old and died from a heart attack. My dad decided to put a camera in his room. I honestly don’t know why when he has a locked door, which I don’t know the password to. As time flew by, my brother and I were starting to grow up to become teens to adults. My adopted parents, however, bought us both iPhones that cost $300-$600 and put restrictions, blocks, and trackers on our phones, they said that the phones were used for emergencies only. And when I mention emergency use only, I mean mom, dad, and police. I honestly don't get why they couldn’t just get cheap flip- phones that cost at least $80 or $90? Not only did my parents have a problem with not trusting me and my brother, but my parents also didn’t trust us in general, they thought that we did drugs, buy alcohol, and throw some random parties in the house even though we have never in our life have we ever done such a thing. Let me just tell you this, because I find it really messed up and really obnoxious. So when my dad accused me of throwing a party in the house I was literally laughing so hard and making so many stupid jokes. Let me tell you why. I live in PA in private development. My neighbors would call the police on each other for so many dumb reasons. So our neighbors would call the police on each other for various reasons such as someone is playing their music too loud, or someone just trespassed on to my property, or someone just targeted their gun to my house, or someone’s kid just ran away, called the child service. I would literally record the amount of times our neighbor has called the cops on each other and I would shove the video in front of someone's face to show if I would dare throw a wild party and have someone call the cops on me and have them chasing me. Not only have my parents falsely accused us of doing stuff we would never do or stalk on our phones and add restrictions and trackers, but this one just gets more messed up. So I got my driver's license in May and I have not driven since then. So Christmas finally came, and my dad bought me a car. Let me rephrase that one… (I thought my dad bought me a car and I thought he trusted me with it). But, he didn’t trust me a single bit. Every Time I was driving in the car with him, he would get so nasty with me that he would punch me and start yelling at me and treated me so badly and so mean. My dad was then Going to New York and he had accused me of stealing the car he got me for Christmas or of driving it without his permission rather than. But Never have I ever done that because I still had forgotten how to drive. So he has been hiding the car keys away from me, and he has not let me drive the car once alone. I have never driven to school on my own or to anywhere on my own. The last time I was able to drive the car on my own was when I drove to Quakertown and to the nockamixon park. But I knew that he still didn’t trust me. Not only has phones and cars and being accused of other bullcrap nonsense, but my dad started putting cameras outside the house. One camera shows the view of the walkway to the door entrance and the driveway. The other cameras show the view of the driveway and the view of the entire lawn, including the private development road. My dad has also put more cameras inside… INSIDE the house!!!! I am freaking the hell out, I mean like I am scared to take a shower, to go to the bathroom, to sleep in my room, and to get dressed. I am scared and I am freaking out, checking every single goddamn day of my life to seeing if there's a hidden camera in the bathroom or in my room. My brother was going to college and also had a good job, he then started having depression when our mother just kept saying to us about how selfish and ungrateful kids we are. She kept repeating it over and over and kept threatening to kick him out of the house. Where he was living in NY. Because my brother was experiencing so much stress, and trauma, he was smoking at a young age because your entire body technically doesn’t fully develop until you're 24 years old; especially your brain. And I am worried about my brother. The stress just kept getting worse, and my brother continued to smoke, so he decided to move out to a friend’s house and lost his job and his car he bought. I am sick and worried about my own brother now. I don’t know when I would ever get to see him and know if he is safe and healthy and if he is safe. I am only in PA because I had to finish my high school year of school, class of 2020. Even after my brother moved out, my mom continued to bring more stress but to me now. So recently, she had called me and started cursing me out and so I cursed her out and again she just kept repeating that I and my brother are the most selfish and the most ungrateful kids she has ever met in her entire life. She then told me that she wishes that she had never adopted us. So the word for word this is exactly what she said… “We saw the first picture of both of you and man I wish I had never adopted you, kids. Had I known that you both would be so selfish and ungrateful, I wish I would have never adopted you, kids. I wish I had just left you both in that horrendous place.” So since she was living in NY, she came to PA and told me that if I am not happy then I should leave. I honestly did, but I don’t know where to go because we live in the middle of nowhere where everything is like an hour or so away from you on foot. She got mad and started hitting me and told me to leave. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me. Instead, she tried to aggressively grab my clothes, like she was trying to take them off and told me that if I planned on leaving I had to go out fully naked. Because the clothes I am wearing are all hers. Because she had bought the clothes, and it belongs to her, not me. I had mentioned to my adopted mom about what she had said, about how she wishes that she had never adopted me and my brother, she then denies the fact that she did say it!!!! She said that I was making bullcrap up, even though I know for a fact she did say it. If the phone company allows you to hear people’s conversation, the day they had a conversation, and when and at what time, I would literally show proof to anyone. Not only has she threatened to kick me out of the house without any clothes on, but my adopted mom also said that she won’t support me for my college. She won’t help pay for my college. I only have two more years of nursing school, and for the rest of my nursing years, I can pay off on my own. I just want to get the hell out of here and buy my own house, my own car, my own phone, and my own computer. I just want to have my own life where I can be happy and to see my brother again. I just want my brother to be safe and healthy and for both of us to be happy and free. I don’t want to feel like a prisoner in a house. I don’t want to feel or be treated like a criminal. I want to find a job, but I am not allowed to. I found a good babysitting/nannying job that could pay me 1,000 but I wasn’t allowed to have the job. Even if I did have a job, my dad won’t take me. Also, my friends can’t take me because they all went to college. All I need is a cheap car that would drive me to work, and I need a phone that would allow me to get in contact with anyone. I am in college, just not out of state. I live in Riegelsville rd on gallows hill rd. Can anyone please give me some suggestions?

TL;DR [My mom's a really horrible person and she ruined my life]As a bit of background, I am 14yo M Indian-American, and this isn't the regular case of strict parents and impossibly high expectations, although it does make it worse. My story begins about 11 years ago. During childbirth my mother died, which left my dad in a state of panic and a desperate need of a wife of whom I could call mom and love me the same. When I was 1 they married and began a life together. When I was 3 however, my mother twisted my arm (this was in Wisconsin at the time), this broke the bone and dislocated my arm. At the time I remember her look of anger and the ambulance I was loaded into. But alas, the journey only gets worse.It was when I was 5, did the abuse really start (we moved to India at the time), and it was all because of speculation. Put simply, I was watching Tom and Jerry on the sofa, and my mom was taking a shower. Now being the relatively okay person I am I ran over to the door to close it, out of courtesy, but just as I ran over to close it out of courtesy but my mom got dressed and almost walked out of the door before seeing me. She had thought that I was trying to catch a glimpse of her in the shower through a mirror in front of the door and was furious. At first, I began to explain but apparently because I ran away from her when she showed up at the door unexpectedly I was damned. I eventually (after hours of bashing, crying, and trying to tell her that U didn't do anything wrong) admitted that did indeed do it (even though I didn't) to stop the abuse, but naive me didn't realize the consequences.  For the rest of the day,  she choked me, stepped on my stomach, hit me and bashed my head on the walls and the furniture. She also made me sit out on the balcony for the rest of the day, not giving me a bite to eat. But before my dad came home, she wiped my face and sat me down on the couch to tell my dad that nothing had happened. And before someone gets skeptical as to why the neighbors didn't call the cops, I don't really know, all I know is that child abuse isn't taken very seriously in India, and corruption and bribes run rampant through the police force (at least that was my experience). The rest of the time after that is a mix, but from family accounts, I could piece together what had happened. Apparently, my dad was horrified when he found the bruising, blood, and stomach problems and began to yell at my mom. Then came court battles of which my mom \"defended\" herself by saying my dad had physically assaulted her and managed to throw my dad in Jail for days (hence the bribery and corruption), she also threatened to go to news media with her sack of lies she called a story. Eventually, they came to an agreement (I don't know how) and decided to stick together. But afterward, the doctors realized I had a problem and was sent into the ICU because her immense abuse crushed one of my intestines, and I wasn't able to eat anything otherwise I would cough up bile. I was hungry, stitched up to an IV, and barely anybody came to visit me. But the doctors came up with a fix, and I was out and healthy.The year after, some of my relatives on my deceased mom's side began contacting my dad, to tell him that I would be safer with them away from the abuse. For a few months, this was true until they decided not to give me back to my dad and didn't allow my dad to visit. Cue the arguments and yelling. Then after a giant family argument that distanced both the relatives on my true mom's side and the \"sack of lies\" mom's side. Then after precarious arguments, a little bit of minor physical abuse and hell of a lot of verbal and mental abuse. We land to where I am today. Please know, that even though she's terrible I never harbored any resentment, as I always wanted to think of her as my mom, the person I could love, and maybe get some back. My mom's relatives are also extremely nice and I hold great respect for my aunt, grandma, and grandpa on my mom's side. But I have always tried to be the best son. My mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, which makes her in constant pain. So I clean the house, bring her food even if she doesn't as for it, remind her to take her medication, and check-in with her every single day so that she can vent whatever she's feeling. And I always try to make her feel happy, whether it's cleaning something extra, doing something so that she doesn't have to do it, or spending part of my trip to Disneyland by helping her carry her bags and making sure she isn't cold, hungry or in pain. I'm not saying that I'm the best son, I'm truly not, but I do what I can and try to minimize my . . . \"screw-upness\"?  And I never expect a reward and mostly do things and don't even take credit for it or give the credit to my sister which makes my mom and her feel happy. But it all goes unnoticed or neglectedAnd now for more than the 6 years, I have been here in California I have undergone verbal abuse beyond measure. Things along the lines of, \"You should go die, we'll all be better off, maybe we'd cry for a few days but in the end, we will be happy\" or her infamous \"I've done so much for you, I gave you a mom to love and you disrespect me like this! I gave up having another child for you!\" or the one that hurts the most: \"You killed your mom, and if she saw you today she would kill herself again\". Other than that there are the smaller hints of you're not a worthy son, you do nothing for us and we do everything for you, you are the curse upon our lives. You hurt everyone you go near, and so on.There's really not a piece of writing that I could express all her insults but you get the point. All this really starts to take a toll, I have never been allowed to express my emotions as I'm either too young to be sad and stressed out, being angry is disrespectful and crying is weak. I have been suicidal since the age of 8 and frequently cut myself. But thanks to a couple of friends, I have started to self-heal, I don't cut as much anymore and try not to cry. I sit in my room awake just wondering \"Is it so wrong to ask for a mom\", \"mom, why did you have to leave\", \"I hope dad's alright, maybe I'm just a financial drain\". But I'm telling you that even though life sucks, worry about making today at least a little bit less sucky than yesterday and soon you'll heal. I didn't write this for pity or attention, if you look, this is my first post on Reddit. If you don't believe me then that's okay, please go about your day, I really don't have the energy to argue. And if you're still reading I thank you for listening to my story, and I hope your own gets a whole lot better. If you guys want to hear more about my life just ask, writing stuff makes me happy and I'd be happy to spill my feelings. - Person who cares."}, {"sno": 33, "created": 1601851747.0, "title": "My mom's got covid.

I will be giving you one tip on a weekly basis that you can implement in your day to day life. Also try it for at least a week or 10 days consistently to see any improvements. It may work for some and may not work for others. Tip 1 STOP TRYING TO STOP OR CONTROL YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS It is not possible to stop or control your thoughts.A lot frustration stems from trying to control your thoughts.Thoughts  come and go. Trying to control what thoughts occur when, or trying to stop certain thoughts from happening altogether, is a poor use of your time and energy.Try this Experiment-  Try NOT to think of a PINK ELEPHANT, it actually makes it more likely that you will. It’s called Ironic process theory, and refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface.What you can do or learn to do is accept that you can’t control thoughts, develop the skill of observing mind-made activity (thought production) without getting caught up in it. With consistent practice, you’ll discover for yourself that the content of your mind does not matter. What matters is how you let it affect you. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds floating across the sky: instead of getting lost in them, you can choose to watch them come and go."}, {"sno": 37, "created": 1601232364.0, "title": "Please Help me,", "selftext": "Hi everyone,I am a 11th standard student from India.

They only love my older brother, it doesn't bother them what I like or what I want. Their love is in the ratio of 99:1 for me and my brother.

You all might think that I am jealous of my brother, yeah that's true and this jealous has made me rebellious. I have the courage to suicide but if I suicide now then everyone will think that I took this step because of the girl with whom I am in relationship. I can't bear any more pain, I am tired.

My parents have gaslighted me since the day I was born. My family has criticized me, controlled me, and have gradually killed the person I was supposed to be. I don't know who I am. I was raped by a family friend for 3 years, sexually harassed from the age of 9. I asked them to take me to a therapist and they denied that I am depressed and told me to 'think positive'. My father has terrorized and emotionally abused me and my mother since forever, but denies it. Everybody denies things they did, and I do not know what is the truth anymore. They tell me what to wear, what to eat, who to talk to, when to go out, when to return, how to even use the toilet. I had to ask their permission to make a phone call at night, ask them if I can even cut my hair. Issues with my parents kept reflecting in my relationships and I currently about to lose my boyfriend because I have too many issues to cope and I show him the same terrorizing, mindfucking behaviour my parents do to me. I hate myself, I hate to look at my body. My family members have compared me to my friends and called me ugly infront of them, when I was already suffering from inferiority regarding my body. I have tried to reach out to my parents, my mom, but they deny, saying that I think too much. They blame me instead. Since they control everything, using the pandemic they now do not let me go out, or bring anyone home. I am here inside the perimeters of my house for 7 continual months. I cannot sneak out because my father has threatened me that if I by any chance come back with the virus, that will destroy our family and I will be responsible if anyone dies. It's bad in India. Then they even start scolding if I go downstairs without explaining or having a valid reason. I am inside these walls and then also I am not left alone. They constantly check what I am doing. And then my graduation exams are starting in 5 days and I have literally forgotten everything and I am trying so hard to sit with my studies but after 5 minutes I just can't. Either I cannot concentrate because I am just fucking mentally exhausted or they are constantly entering the room, moving things around, talking about stuff, regardless of what I am doing.

Depression is seen as something that losers get so students don't see any therapist. 20+ students committed suicide this year due to the JEE exams(which I also appeared for) and the results declared today so many more will do that.

I just ask you to make at least this easy in my life.)Hi,This will be a copy paste text as I may not be strong enough to share everything all over again. This is my second attempt at this. I couldn't do it the first time.Anyway, I'm suffering from depression from past 3 years. Actually, I have had several episodes throughout my childhood due to bullying in school and College. But it got worse after I graduated. My parents (mom, especially) treated me like trash because I couldn't land on a job. Really changed my perspective on everything. I felt my worth is nothing to anyone. I grew up in a poor family and my parents being the way they are, isn't their fault anyway. But all these sudden responsibilities (I have 2 younger sisters and I'm an India. So you can imagine what I mean) put over my head, is just too much. All things I wanted to achieve while I was college were vanishing right in front of me. The realisation that I'd never get to live the life I dreamt of, is really messing up my life.What's all these about? What's the point if I'm never able to achieve my dreams? Why can't I just run far away and live for myself? What's the point of living like this if I'm never going to be alright about my career or life itself? What's the point of living if I know I'm never going to be happy?I can just jump off a building or breathe nitrogen gas and never have to worry about being sad or depressed again. When I'm thinking about suicide, I'm never scared of not being happy again. But I'm always scared of getting hurt again.I request you to not ask me what my dream is our discuss a way to fulfill or achieve it. I have already discussed it a billion times to every single person I have shared about my depression. Yeah, there's a chance that I might achieve them. But it'd take me YEARS to do it. I'm not capable of hold up myself for so long. I don't want to wait for so many years. I want to be happy now. I want to not feel depressed again. I wish we were mindless creatures rather than to deal with all these emotional drama ( I wanna say emotional roller coaster but mines just a downward spiral).My job? I'm a customer service chat agent. I have done handful of jobs throughout my life (I'm 24 now), but this job is the worst. I wake up everyday worrying about what kind of customer I'd have to deal with today. I've imagined myself smashing my head on keyboard or ripping my laptop into 2 and getting electrocuted or bleed out to death from my head injury. But I never physically harmed myself.If the information is necessary: I'm a dude living in Bangalore. I'm nihilistic atheist, tryna live as long as I can deal with this meaningless life. I'm doing this cuz my close friend insisted me to try this out. I'm not saying i don't trust in therapy. I'm just saying, surrounded by so much negativity while doing THIS job, this text based therapy wouldn't be much helpful.I want to thank you and the whole team for doing all these and for free of cost.

This is really aggravayed by COVID again because the people whom I used to talk to no longer talk with me at all and also due to different schedules.**I feel like I'm in a loop** . Just wake up eat , question life , feel sorry and wish COVID goes away and sleep.**I have gained 10 kgs** of weight and **injured my leg doing these stupid home workouts** which are not as effective as actual workouts in an actual gym .I miss the gym dearly.Feel like shit carrying that weight around and not being able to workout properly or visit a doctor because these fucking doctors mis-treat patients too.I cannot handle my stupid parents . **They just cannot seem to understand that depression is real** and my relationship with them is extremely toxic although there is no love lost , there is no compatibility at all. I feel like I'm trapped at home with people who just don't understand me and do not value mental health and think of it as just another attention.&amp;#x200B;I do not feel like coding at all. I just don't feel like learning anything at all. I wish I could have a gap year where I could pursue what I wanted. **Also being forced to enter into a Masters program because of leaving the country is a much better alternative than living somewhere you are just treated as fucking statistic.**  I fucking hate my country . I hate the people here and the mindset of the people.  I hate my fucking unversity which is a big scam. I feel like I want to droput and pursue something related to coding or maybe artisitic on my own but this degree and parents won't ever support or accept the fact that I could do something other than CS.**I just do not feel like eating , or doing anything. I feel extremely depressed.**&gt;All my life I have never been able to be around people who share a similar mindset to me and have extremely different interests and passionate about them . All people seem to care about are grades and nothing remotely related to humans or actually. I just feel I wish I had chosen a better university where I had people who wanted to pursue something related to research. However ,this scam of a country does not promote research among undergrads as well. The only people able to pursue this are for the Tier 1 ,2 unis where the profs actually know some shit. This shitty university of mine is forcing to sit for placements into mass recruiting company's and try going to FAANG. Fuck I do not want to become an SDE . I wish I could do something remotedly related to original research. All the research they seem to know is copy paste from google  ,bribe recruiteres and conference judges for paper acceptances. Which feels like a **big scam.**I have absolutely no motivation left whatsoever . I wish COVID goes away and I can heal both physically and mentally . I just cannot seem to work despite knowing the problems I could face for not acting whatever I have planned out."}, {"sno": 47, "created": 1598481929.0, "title": "I am tired of judgemental doctors.", "selftext": "So I was diagnosed with clinical depression on March of this year. I have been on medications since then which helped me a lot and get back on track.I can still tell those few months were hell (October 2019 till now when I have depression relapse). I am consulting a psychologist (female) and psychiatrist (male) both are quite understanding and well aware. I have absolutely no complaints from them. On the start of this year, a medical specialist wrongly diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and prescribed me medicines. After which I started consulting my psychiatrist who said that I don't have hypothyroidism and stopped the medication for thyroid. I took the medicines for 8-10 days which messed up my hormone levels. Then the psychiatrist doubted that I may have hyperthyroidism but didn't prescibe me any medicines. I had to give blood samples multiple times with an interval of 6 weeks. This time the doctor is still confused and told me to do Ultrasound.My point is that I have to consult other doctors besides psychiatrist due to many reasons.Often I have to face their judgemental looks and insensitive words when they see my past reports and medications. I am not the confrontation type of person so I say nothing. But it clearly bothers me. I understand that India is not \"educated enough about mental illness\" but being a doctor doesn't give them the right to judge me. It hurts me a lot and makes me furious. It makes me doubt myself and all the struggle I had to go through and still have to. It messes with my mind. It triggers me and reminds me of the times when I have really depressed and couldn't tell anyone because of the fear of not being understood.  Their way of speaking and words make me thinks that it's my fault.I can't even say anything to them as those men( I have only experienced this with male doctors, I am not gender stereotyping at all) have fragile egos and I don't have the guts."}, {"sno": 48, "created": 1598458039.0, "title": "COVID helped me realize everything.", "selftext": "I'm 17M.COVID helped me realize that people who appeared to be my friends don't mind if I exist or not. I've tried approaching them but I've either been ghosted or messaged like a stranger. Every time, I am the person who starts the conversation. I know there's nothing wrong with that but if a person calls you their friend then it is kind of obvious that any person in that friendship can message to the other side.People who I believed and who I talked with are not able to find even a minute out of their week to message me.  Before quarantine times they declared our group of friends as 'family'.I've always been the 'funny' guy of the group, and just like in the memes as the funny guys are depicted of being depressed within their heads, the same situation exists in my life.There are about 2-3 people who I'd considered to be my bestfriends, but they proved their relationship with me as otherwise. None of them care. None.Often, when there is some kind of work or support they need, for example, an emotional support, they mention it when I've messaged them, they talk to me, and when I ask details (just to listen not even suggest any solution because I know they'll find their way out of that problem on their own, they are smart and mature enough for that) they say that its personal and I can't ask any questions about that. Some of them tell me that they love me, but I know that is to maintain the confidentiality of the content they told me about. I've tried to believe otherwise too, that maybe I'm just overthinking, but in that case their actions proves that wrong every time. I am treated as an audio diary basically. In terms of work, I do it and if they ask for it I share, and that's that no further talk.I come to realize that being resourceful and funny can be a curse, so to get rid of it I've cut myself from everybody. Since a month I haven't messaged any single one of them, I find them online on social media and successfully resist the urge to message them. I share memes but again I'm either ghosted or just message a 'haha' text or so. Those people are smart enough to understand that if I'm memeing a lot I am not feeling good and I'm searching an escape from reality, but then again the point that they just don't care about me is proved.So, I don't have any friends.As far as family goes, I have a mother who loves me but when I make the slightest of mistake she ends up supporting my physically abusive father who has been beating me up since I was 10. He says 'when you'll get to face the harsh realities of the world after you become an adult, my beatings will seem like a gesture of blessing to you, and you will thank me that I put sense into your brain.' But I genuinely think that its affecting me otherwise.I don't feel like studying anymore, but if I don't study then my father would do what he does even more because he wants a full utilization of the money he had invested in me. For him, earning money and providing it for me and my sibling is ultimate parenting, because love and social growth is the kind of thing that mothers are supposed to do.I am somewhat talented, I can learn skills on an incredibly fast pace and I have proved it many times, but I've been told by my father that my talents have no value in the world and only marks (he doesn't ever say education but marks) are the only way to success.I am smart too, my favorite subject is Math and I am good at it but as I told just now, I don't feel like studying.Because of all this, I am lazy, fat, depressed, irritated and angered all the time.All of this used to happen before COVID too, but as the conditions have become worse and so is my life.I've lost all motivation to do anything, and everything I dream of achieving is either disapproved by my father or it just seems too far fetched.Whenever I try to distract myself from depressing feelings, I try to use social media but my parents think that I'm constantly chatting with someone and they'll be a bad influence as they assume any stranger in this world to be. This is the reason I'm scared to put this post up too.I am somewhat suicidal but I'm also scared of dying, just like I'm scared of every little thing in this world. I get suicidal thoughts, but as soon as that thought comes to my mind I feel like the reason that such thoughts occur to me is just my fault and I have to deal with it somehow, even if its somebody else's fault in reality.I feel like I should just approach my grandparents (maternal side) who are financially and socially stronger who I really love a lot, more than anybody, but they also have a busy life because they have other children and grandchildren apart from my mother and me respectively. My paternal side grandparents are just an older version of my father, who want to hit me but won't because their bodies ache due to aging.I'm from India.Whatever I just told has been going on since 5-7 years. Which is about 30-40% of my lifetime until now.I can't go to a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor or any such aid because in our country millennials and boomers think that such things are only meant 'mentally disabled' people and not for 'respectable' people (even though I have no respect anywhere). I cannot call any helpline number (if it exists, I mean, I don't know if it does exist) because anything related to a mental illness is just fiction for people around me.I don't know what to do.I want to get active and get thin while my education goes on so that my body can produce whatever happy chemical it is supposed to produce so that I don't continue to feel and exist like I do.But like I said, I have no motivation .This is my first post on Reddit and I thank God that I was able to join a community online where I can open up and just blabber about whatever shit is going on, anonymously."}, {"sno": 49, "created": 1598411336.0, "title": "Worst day", "selftext": "I am just having the worst day.

I also have a two 'close' university friends, a bunch of other casual ones and my old highschool friends back home. My problem? I've never been in a romantic relationship. Never. Not one girl has ever taken interest in me. Sure,  I talk to them, and a few are quite close as friends, but I've never been in an actual relationship. All of my friends are in one, and while I'm extremely happy for them and they are quite supportive of me, I feel worthless. I'm never going to be good enough.

Add on to this the fact that my parents are somewhat stereotypical indians, and I don't know I will have their support or if they even want to see me get together with someone (this probably isnt true; my mom actually asked me a few times if I got a girlfriend). I know I probably sound like an edgy teen or that this issue is trivial or very common, and that things will get better. This probably isn't even real depression right? I'm sorry if I misused that word. Past few weeks, this realization and feeling of being absolutely worthless to anyone as anything but a fucking resource or means to get work done has been fucking with my head hard (this probably isn't even true, but the scenarios just keep going on in my head and this is my current mindset). I'm probably just blaming my inability to get someone on my parents. I've cried alone in my room multiple times and I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy. I'm fucking lost. Maybe its just quarantine? I know a lot of you will tell me to put myself out there, and I've already done that. Hell, I'm an active in three different clubs and in a fraternity with a ton of good guys.Just yesterday I jokingly said to myself that if I killed myself then my thoughts would stop going haywire, and only after a moment did I realize the severity of what I just said.

I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my \"beliefs\" to myself and don't tell them about it. A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents.

They always expected from us that we suppose to know everything. Even when my brother was suffering from stage 3 brain cancer and was in stroke paralysis my dad treated him like shit. I used to think that my dad has work pressure that's why he's abusive and all but when my brother had cancer my father was retired so i still don't know why he treated my elder brother like shit (my bro died aug 2018). Last year around may i had a severe panic attack where i was literally choking and unable to breath bc i also have hypertension, it happened in front of my parents and when i was stable after like half hour later i told my parents \"i think we should go see our doc\" and they said \"you're on meds, it's your fault if something happening to you\". I suffer from anxiety disorder and panic attack prob alongside multiple other mental illnesses and this is where \"parents should be treated like gods\" and emotions and stuff comes... I always want to believe that you know, my parents do their absolute best According to whatever knowledge they have about parenting but still the way my father used to abuse us is still unjustified. My father wants to me live a life he have thought about. My mom's a lil good though, she cooks me delicious food and stuff but she also expects me to do everything on my own which is too much for my mental health. It's just miserable here. I still care there are still emotions bc maybe I'm raised like that but still my mind says what's wrong is wrong. I have some good friends that keeps me alive i guess. This whole \"parents are god\" this is a mess in India and it's just too much on a childs fkin' mental health. I wish i could be more practical bc I can't focus on myself. My parents are 60+ so I'm automatically supposed to help them even if they didn't help me when i was a child. Any advice is helpful, thanks. Life's just too much depressing!"}, {"sno": 63, "created": 1595686805.0, "title": "I’m so tired of having to always be optimistic (TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of assault, self harm)", "selftext": "Hey guys. i guess right now i’m just going through the motions. i’m alright, but not really. i guess i’m just tired, i feel like i’ve been through enough, and i know my trauma is nowhere as bad as what others have gone through, it has definitely taken a toll over the years.as a kid, i was molested, bullied, abused, and my already pre-existing mental health conditions got worse. but i stuck through it, and made it to high school.high school was the darkest time of my life. i was raped and this put me in a really dark place. i was very suicidal my sophomore year. i was also being groomed by pedos, and hurt a lot by people. my eating disorder got worse, and i self harmed a lot. my physical health was also taking a toll. i still have a messed up stomach and occasional fainting spells to this day. i was on every medication in the book, and that just made everything crazy. i was home instructed most of my sophomore and junior year, and pulled everything together my senior year, somehow graduated, and then went to college. when it came to friends, i do have friends, but after high school, i wanted to distance myself as much as possible from high school. even my senior year, i kept bailing on all these people that did care about me, something i still regret.i was really optimistic about college. everyone told me it was a new beginning, and a fresh start. and, my first year, was terrible. my college orientation was terrible since for some reason, my schedule was a mess and i had to get so much shit fixed. but i was still optimistic. when i moved into my dorm, i realized one of my roommates was kinda crazy. just not someone i really vibed with, which is fine, but it started affecting my mental health when random people would come into our room at 2 am, constant drug deals happening in our room, and when she told me about her eating disorder. this triggered mine and so mine got worse. i told a mutual friend about the situation, who i thought knew about her eating disorder, and basically got into a lot of drama with my roommate. i really shouldn’t have told our mutual friend, and instead maybe an RA, but my dumbass just wasn’t thinking. while there was all this roommate drama going on, i met my now-ex. and this asshole, i swear to god. in the beginning of our relationship, when we were getting to know each other, he never respected my boundaries, but my dumbass didn’t want to say no, because i was head over heels for him. and it makes me mad. i started coming to my senses, and wanted to break it off, but then, i found out about my grandfather. my mom told me that my grandfather, who at the time lived in india, was very sick all of the sudden. i was very confused because literally before college started, he was fine. i talked to him on the phone and he was fine. also, this was around mid-october. and so i hung onto my ex because i felt like i had no one. i didn’t really make a ton of friends in the beginning because i was so stressed about pre-med and classes and stuff. the ones i did make, i kind of got out of touch with at that time, and only spent time with him. eventually i moved in with him, and i kept ignoring every red flag.my grandfather passed away late october. my parents had to go to india without me because i had exams that week, and i couldn’t even say goodbye. he passed away from cancer. this was the first close relative i lost, and it broke me. i stopped eating, i barely could go to class, i barely slept. the only person i talked to was my ex. all i did was lay in bed. i passed out during one of my labs, because i didn’t eat that whole day. it was just such a mess. a week after i found out, my ex decided to come back home drunk, and i was so worried, and stayed up until 4 am taking care of him. i remember ordering him food, going downstairs in the cold at 2 am just for him. the week after that, he allegedly cheated on me. i say allegedly because i’m not 100% sure, but essentially, i saw texts between him and some girl. that weekend was veterans day weekend, and i went home to spend sometime with my family. the one weekend i was gone, he cheated. his excuse is he felt hungover and he needed weed, and his only way to get weed was to have this girl over and smoke some of hers. i obviously didn’t believe it, but i just could not accept the fact he could cheat on me. and, i couldn’t go back to my dorm. i was too dependent on him, and i knew i had no where else to go. he knew that. we argued a lot throughout our relationship. he was a big dude too, and he was very aggressive. it was a bad situation, but i just sorta accepted it. by the time exams came around, i pulled myself together and finally went home for winter break. honestly, things got a lot better in january. i realized that friends are important, and those friends that i cut out for all these extraneous reasons (such as a toxic person that is friends with all of them) are stupid, and these people care about me. i got back in touch with my high school friends, and made more college friends. things got worse and worse with my ex. he was very emotionally manipulative. as soon as i decided to leave, he would cry and say he would not be able to live without me. just emotionally manipulative stuff like that. i also had this one friend who was just very toxic but i didn’t really realize it. she put a lot of her stresses on me, and expected me to fix them. valentine’s day came around. he didn’t do anything for me. i know that it isn’t a competition, but for his bday/christmas, i went all out and got him something special and made him something. on v-day, i had 2 exams, first one at 7:30 am and i still wrote him a little note. that’s honestly all i wanted, a letter, a note, a cute drawing. anything. but he didn’t do anything for me, and it hurt. in march, because of quarantine, i had to go home. my ex helped me move out of my dorm, since my parents at the time didn’t know i was living with him. he met my mom and dad. oh and two days later, he stole money from me. call me a dumbass, because i was very dumb for doing this, but i left my card on his phone. and i forgot he had access to it. i’ll be honest, in all my previous “relationships,” money was never an issue. he was the first guy that actually made money a factor in our relationship.initially, we were going to split everything. this guy i went out with before him would pay for everything. personally i never liked it. i was totally okay with splitting, but i chipped in more than him. he basically said that his parents weren’t giving him the money he needed. and his excuse for not having a job is that he said his parents would not let him. i know, a very dumb excuse. around november, i let him use my card whenever i didn’t want to go get groceries. that’s how he had it. over the course of a month, he stole 300 dollars. and lied about everything. i feel stupid, all i ever did was love and care about him. my friendships aren’t super strong, but i’m building them. my GPA isn’t the best, but i’m bringing that up too. i feel shitty, but i’m trying my goddamn best. and this is what i’m tired of. why doesn’t it get better? i feel like i’ve had it hard enough already, but there’s always something that happens. someone hurts me. someone i trust is fake. and it’s so frustrating. it’s struggle after struggle, and i don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. i don’t even know if there is one. thanks for reading guys, i know this was very long. TL;DR: i’ve had a lot of trauma in my life, and even when college was supposed to be my fresh start, it doesn’t feel like it is. things are a little better, but still just as hard."}, {"sno": 64, "created": 1595648857.0, "title": "Please Help Me", "selftext": "I (16M) currently live in India with my father, step-mother and elder sister. I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (slaves). Please help me.

I want to give a little background information before I get to what I don’t know what to do with my life.I grew up in an abusive household. My dad is an alcoholic immigrant from India and he verbally, physically and psychologically abused me, my siblings, my mom, his own parents and his siblings. Growing up I would get yelled at, beaten you and told I’m a piece of crap. My older sister would stand up to him or ignore him or tell him to be quiet, but he wouldn’t beat her after a certain age, whereas I still got beat. Because she never listened, he would put it on me and make me feel like double shit. I played sports growing up, but after every practice and game he would tell me I played like crap and I was a piece of shit that I wasted his money. If I scored, he would be like it wasn’t a “worthy enough” goal and that it needed to be something you see on tv every time I scored. I eventually quit sports when I overtrained and injured myself because I wanted to be worthy in my dads eyes, but 3 years later my knees still hurt. I got slapped for not getting straight A’s. I also was constantly told that I was fat, and that I was a shame and a disgrace because he used to be a champion weightlifter. Yeah I gained weight after I injured myself, but food is all I turn to when I’m feeling like crap.About 2 years ago was my breaking point when he choked my mom in the car and then beat her up when we got home. I was so nervous and panicky in the moment, my younger brother kept telling me to call the police but I couldn’t. I went to school the next day and broke down every class before I got the guts to tell my counsellor what was up. (Basically told cops, got a social worker to come to my house, was told by my parents to lie and lied my ass off to the social worker)I graduated high school in 2018, and went to a college my sister was going to because she told me “what makes you think you’ll go places, you’re basically going to end up where I will.”I didn’t apply anywhere else and watched as all my friends got accepted into their schools and me this shithole college I never wanted to go to. I honestly didn’t want to stay in my town and study in any schools in my province, I just wanted to get away from anyone and everyone I knew. I was a good student, not going to lie I was way better than my sister, and got really good grades. But I started declining towards the end of grade 12 after that incident with my mom. I couldn’t do school after 2 semesters because I would get nervous and panicky, wouldnt eat or sleep, and would cry and puke. I dropped out and tried again, but dropped again. I have cut myself multiple times and planned suicide, but never followed through. I’ve been working at a grocery store for a year and a month now and I like it, but it’s not what I want to do forever.I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I’m fucking useless and can’t do school because it overwhelms me. I don’t know if I want a degree or not because nowadays a degree won’t get you a good job, you need to do more. I’ve been brainstorming, but keep getting confused. I feel like shit because my sister is doing well in school and wants to become a doctor. I keep thinking “we’ll I used to be so smart, what will people think if I get a mediocre job?” I keep getting told by my parents “well you’re born in *developed country* and you guys are smarter than we are and you want to do this? Or that? Be a doctor or lawyer” when in reality it’s not like that. I keep getting asked by my grandparents and parents when I’ll go back to school and if I’ll do something with my life. Fuck I just want to overdose and fucking die I don’t know what the fuck to do.  My uncle keeps telling me to do a small 1-2 year diploma with a good paying job but then I tell myself “what about a degree? Shouldn’t I get a degree or something? Everyone is getting a degree. Why not me?” I keep getting in my head and I’m fucking lost. I need help.Edit: forgot to mention that I didn’t want to go back to college after the second time I dropped because we lost some money and my sister told me I wasted money and my mom also said that. Fast forward a few months, my mom tells me to just take classes and if I failed it’s okay. So I don’t understand her or my sister.

On the fact that i don't value life anymore? Or  the issue on how pathetic i am?I never really understood why people would want to kill themselves before. But recently i finally understood what it feels like to be on their shoes. And that's why i feel so pathetic, and weak. Lately i thought about my life a lot, my past, present, and the hopeless future. And suddenly i found no value in life anymore! I am making this post because i want to organize my thoughts. I want to know what exactly is wrong with me. This may be a bit long but i hope you guys can finish it for me.I have never enjoyed my life as long as i remember. I came from a poor family so i never had the things i wanted since childhood. I remember myself always envying others, and i started loosing interest in hanging out with friends because of it. I also am a sole child so my loner life already began during my childhood. At grade 6, i entered a central boarding school, against my will because we deeply fear boarding schools here. But my parents want me to enter it because of the free education. The name of the institution was JNV. There was a lot of ragging there, and the second saturday of the month was always what i spend the rest of the month thinking about, it was parents visiting day. And that was the only thing i find it worth remembering from that school. I'm currently a college student, currently in my 3rd semester. I am renting a small house by myself here. The college is 10km away from my home but i often need to go there by foot because transportation is not that good here. Oh, I'm from Mizoram, a small underdeveloped state in India.I'm not particularly good at studying. I already have 3 back paper during my 1st and 2nd semester. I also am quite ugly, and have acne. i have never had a girlfriend. The fact that i am poor, and bad at socialising could also play a big factor on that. Also i genuinely am not interested in relationships.As i said. I am a pathetic person. I envy others. Most of my classmates have a motorcycle so i want one a lot too. But it's hard earning money here, as there are no part time jobs, and my family is poor so i know i will never have one. As such i don't really enjoy my college life. Provided my grade is already really bad, and looking at the bleak future, i don't even think continuing studying is worth it.I am an atheist. So i don't really believe in the afterlife. I have never valued life. I don't really care if i die, because that would just mean that i would be leaving this world a little earlier. I don't really care when people die either. These things just comes as a natural thing to me. Many people die everyday, our time will come sooner or later.My parents are christians. They already know that i turned atheist. I also know how disappointed they are on me. Our home always remained my safe haven before. But now all i get after going home is endless sermon at my face, and i still can't miss a single church day because my parents want me to attend it. And indeed i want to fulfill this little wish of theirs. But unknowingly this also became one of the reason why i don't enjoy home anymore. One of the reason could be that we always have a prayer before eating food, but they never fail to pray for me to convert back to christian. It is always extremely uncomfortable. And then i started thinking recently. I don't value my life, I don't care if i die at all. I only value my life for my parents, to live for them. I deeply love them, and i want to do something for them in this life. We are poor so i atleast want to bring some richness into my family. But now they are extremely disappointed in me, disappointed that i became an atheist, disappointed that i am so bad at my studies. And i also am disappointed in myself for letting my parents down in many ways. I just want to leave this life.I tried adding colour to my life a lot. I started playing games. Recently i played league legends and valorant. I indeed enjoy them. But it's extremely limited when you don't have anyone to play with, i have some friends mind you, but they don't really play games. It gets boring very easily. I also started watching lots of porns. I masturbate a lot. But these things don't really seem to help me much. Instead i became much more depressed realising that i am trying so hard to achieve nothing. I just want to end this pathetic life of mine thinking these things.A few days back, i ate some rat poison due to sudden impulsiveness. I immediately regret after eating it. But i ended up not caring and i went to sleep after making a short call to my parents, ofcourse i said nothing about the rat poison thing. Surprising nothing happened, my stomach didn't even hurt a bit after that. Maybe i was actually afraid of death, so i became quite spirited after realising nothing happened. And i doubt i would do something that stupid again lol. I got quite a scare there. Due to covid 19, my life is extremely boring these days. I didn't went home so i live alone in my rented house having nothing to do. To be honest i am very disappointed that my parents didn't ask me to go home. But for reasons i don't feel like going home either. Now that i typed these things out, it seems to be the accumulation of lots of things that made me lose interest in this world. I'm quite pathetic don't you think? Just because i came from a poor family, i don't have many friends, i'm ugly, i don't own a motorcycle like others, and my relationship with my parents became a bit sore, i want to stop living!! I know there are lots and lots of people out there with way worse condition than me that still tries their hardest to live! Though my logical thinking questions the purpose of such life of suffering, i suddenly feel like my life is not that bad anymore.This post actually helped me a lot. I feel like i release a lot of frustration through this post. It made me realize how pathetic i actually am! And maybe i should try a bit harder in looking for values in life.

It's been 2 years since I've known her, closely, 6 years since she was my acquaintance and been in this relationship for the last 9 months. We were best friends while i was in my 3rd relationship, she had a huge liking towards a singer who was locally famous(all three of us are from the same college), while i was her friend, she proposed and he rejected. After that I happened. She has this habit of playing with my hair when im driving (she used to do with the singer guy too), but i was conscious since I was losing my hair and was having a hairstyle so as to fill my spots. I was a bit jealous as the other guy had thick hair and wanted my balding to not cause a problem , so i started to get hair loss treatment which consisted of Rogaine and Finasteride.At the same time, I started to feel jealous about the equation which my gf had with this singer and conveyed the same. They were supposedly best friends, but their vibes threw me off. She told that she felt restricted and needed a break. After the break she came back and told me that she no longer had any feelings for him so I need not feel insecure. However, cut to a month later, I find texts stating how she misses him and How she feels that if they would've been together it would have been great. She also had a habit of saying \"I love you\" to that singer guy, which i wasn't cool , so she told thay she'd stop saying. But that day she even told him that she loves him. I confronted her, she told that it was very vague and she did not mean it at all and she loved him as a friend(whatever that means). We were already having many fights due to incompatibilities, but this broke me completely. From that day onwards, I have lost my ability to think straight, stalked her on instagram, would check if she liked or commented on the songs he posted, etc. In totality i became toxic which was'nt my trait. I was pretty outgoing and the irony was that i left my ex because i was feeling restricted. I asked her to stop talking to him as i was losing my individuality and was focusing on what she was doing, She tried to stop, but would talk to him in someway or the other. It got to a point where i would even hate her mentioning his name while texting. The last time she stopped talking to him, they talked for 4 hrs continuous when they started. I lost my shit and asked her to give me break. I had a panic attack and was about to jump off my balcony. I have totally lost my self confidence, sleep and peace of mind. Im always sad and anxious. I feel that I'm not sufficient and I cannot give her what that other guy can(he's popular and sings well). She gave me an ultimatum to either get over my insecurities or be done with the relationship.In this process of being with her, I lost all of my friends. I have no one to talk to except for reddit. Even now, I'm not able to express myself completely as I feel that it would put her in bad light. I read some articles on how Finasteride induces anxiety, depression, insomnia and a craving for sweets. All of which match with my symptoms. If I continue this way I'll be depressed and if i lose my hair I'll never be confident again. I dont know what to do, i just feel like ending my life now. I feel like there's no one who understands me. I am from India, people here would laugh at me if i tell them that I'm depressed.

So I have nowhere near the study ethic a proper indian student should have but i still get top 5 in my class for most of my classes and sometimes top 5 in my year leveel for others. But my parents or my family in India aren't happy with that. Because one of my cousins got top 4% in the country in her final year of school and another cousin got top 2% and another one got top in the state so the standards for me now set by my parents and everyone that  I know.  But the thing is I am nowhere near that and if i tried to be I'd rather kill myself than get that because I like to have something called a life other than studying. And its like I need top 20% to get into the uni and course I need so thats what I am studying for but if I get more I'll be ecstatic but if I get less than that I'll still be happy because I know I tried my hardest.

My relationship with my parents is going down faster than the speed of light because they expect me to be in my room just studying for 3-4 hours on a school day and 6-7 hours on a non-school day which is just way too much for me to think about. This expectation set by my family is costing me my relationships i have with others including themselves.  Like an hour or so ago i had gotten back from work and started video calling my uncle to see what was up because he had called a couple of times but I couldn't pick up. My dad was like stop talking to people and get to studying and it's like I need some time. So 10 mins later he comes back and says why tf aren't you studying and just gives me a lecture again which gets me down in the dumps pretty quickly and i see a scissor and just think about cutting because I've literally got no one to talk to, my parents haven't even come in to see what I'm doing in the past 2 hours or even check up.   There have been cases where my dad has literally told me and i quote \"I don't respect you as my son\" when I wanted to know the reasoning behind me not being able to go without my friends in summer holidays (they are in december for me) or me getting 95% or 52/55 on a math exam and 3rd in the whole school for a math exam and him being like why didn't you get 1st or why didn't you get 100% and it's like thanks appreciating my 25+ hours of study i put in that week and 60+ hours in the 2 weeks leading up to it. (This was school assessed so it didn't matter much as my end of year exams).  My friends aren't of much help because well just say this I thought they were laughing with me but they were laughing at me so I don't really go to them and also I'll be a burden to most of them so there's that.  I've tried talking to my mum about it and shes like its your dad's fault and if I say something I'll get in trouble and she backed my dad with the i dont respect you debacle.  So any tips?

I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). You know what? I did not sign up for this. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (slaves).

I feel like i have nothing to lose anymore. I've lost everyone.Don't know which subreddit to post in.# Where to begin?* I grew up in South Africa, I am Indian,  but i don't feel like i'm Indian.* I was pretty happy kid, had a lot of friends, my family was all together.* Our family ended up moving to Canada.* And that's where everything changed.It was super hard making friends, as i was the new kid, and because i was brown. I'd get made fun of because of voice, and my skin. It was really hard because it's something i never experienced when i was in South Africa. I'd end up getting bullied a lot.  # Bullying* It started with this teachers daughter who pushed me off the top of the jungle gym, breaking my nose. I couldn't say anything about it, because i was scared of her getting in trouble.* Being a small kid, some of the guys in my class would take my money, and purposely try to hurt me when we'd have gym/physical education class.* Things got worse when i mother caught my classmate pushing me after school, she ended up shouting at him, which i begged her not to.* The next day everyone looked at me weird, i couldn't understand what i did wrong, why this was happening to me.* My classmates would do terrible things to me, throw snow in my face, lie to the teachers about me even though i barely spoke.* Throughout the years i'd fake being sick so i could avoid going to school, but i't didn't last long.* My last years of school were some of the worst memories i have, people would post online about me being a terrorist, ugly, even punch me for no reason.* I couldn't handle the pain anymore, and i had to leave my last year of schooling and finish it through an online school.* There is a lot more that had happened, that hurts so much to remember, and just the thought of it makes me feel sick inside. (extremely sensitive to me, and might be to others)&amp;#x200B;# Video Games/Hobbies* video games use to be my escape from this world, but now i can't even play for more than 5 mins without shutting it off. # University Part 1* Fast forward, my dad enrolls me into medical school, close to South Africa.* I was super happy, not about medical school, but the idea of making friends, or even a girlfriend.* This is where everything just went bad.# Relationships Part 1* I ended up meeting this girl in uni, and we got along quite well, we'd share everything with each other, and i started having feelings for her. I knew she was talking to another guy(long distance) at the same time ,so i tried to hold in my feelings. One day she'd \"told me that if i should stop talking to him?\" I couldn't have it in me to make her choose between me and that guy. This ended up destroying our friendship, and it still bothers me to this day, now she hates me. But i also hate me so it's okay.* After my friendship ended with her, i befriended this other girl and guy, and they were really sweet to me, We'd sit together, have lunch etc.# Heartbreak* This new girl ( lets call her Sid) btw we were just really good friends.* She was suffering with depression just like me, and we instantly connected with each other, and she'd share her pain with me, everyday i'd ask her how she is.Shit i'm sorry this hard to talk about.I'll give a timeline that i can sort of remember.October 19th 2017 It was a festival we celebrate in Indian culture called diwali. This was the day she told me she tried to kill herself, because of all the pain she felt, she opened up to me, and we spoke for hours, she cried a lot, but i finally felt like someone trusted me enough to share their deepest pain with.October 20th She called me asking her to take her back home to India, i jokingly told her, we have to get through med school together, then i'd take her back home. October 21st - Till this day, has been the hardest day of my life.* She messaged me early morning, she posted a black picture on instagram, and gave me her instagram details and asked me \"make sure nobody posts anything bad in the comments\" i was like okay i guess.* Later that day she'd message me telling me, that she was feeling cold, and i tried calling her, but she wasn't picking up.Sorry it's a bit hard to talk about.* My cousin called me 1 hour later, asking me if i knew about the girl who passed away from my class. I was in complete shock.* I tried calling her, no answer, but then i called her roommates and they told me she's fine. i felt relief but at the same time i needed answers to who had passed away.* My cousin called again 5 minutes later, telling me Sid from my class had passed away. Her roommates fucking lied to me.I completely broke inside, cried so hard, i didn't know what to do, i was contemplating jumping of the building, I kept asking my self if i could of done something, I still blame myself everyday, that i could of done more, if i could of seen the signs earlier, i could of done more. She still shows up in my dreams.# Relationships Part 2* After a month of her passing, this group of people 2 guys and 2 girls, asked me to come hang out with them, we became decently good friends after this,* I did gain bad habits from them, i started drinking because of them. Even got tattoos, and lost my first kiss to one of them.* Long story short, I'm entirely to blame for our friendship falling apart. My depression and trust issues got in the way, and they weren't about that lifestyle.* I was more of baggage than a friend. Again i'm to blame for this,&amp;#x200B;# University Part 2* I ended up dropping out of university in 2018, and i went back to Canada, and I've pretty much been here since then, gained a lot of weight, and have almost lost my mind completely.# Family* Our family has grown apart, i have no connections to my cousins, and most of my family has passed away.* I'm no longer close with my older brother, we have had our fair share of fights, and 90% of the time it was my fault, and i take blame for it. We don't talk as much, but i don't say anything to him anymore to upset him.* My parents say i'm fine and nothing is wrong with me, and that i no longer need antidepressants, and they keep bringing it up that i should go back to medical school, even though i don't want to.&amp;#x200B;# Pain Part 1* My brother has a girlfriend, who was really nice to me, kind of wish she was my sister, but it is what it is. She'd stay over sometimes for weeks, while they were studying. * I remember opening up to her about everything, and right away, and for the first time i actually felt better, whenever i'd relapse and have a panic attack, she was there to help with the pain. She'd say the right things at the right moment.* I hate myself for causing her so much of problems, i did overstep boundaries, asking if i could call her when she's free to talk about what i'm going through.* My brother didn't like it, and it would cause a lot of problems and rift between everyone, to the point where she didn't want to stay over anymore, because she felt like she was the problem.* This was all my fault, and i should of never opened up to her, or overstep boundaries.But my brother did turn around at some point, and did allow her to help me, but i took advantage of her kindness, and asked for to much help, probably overwhelming her with all my problems.In my eyes she changed quite a lot after she graduated, maybe it was to protect herself from her own demons. And when ever i'd tell her that she changed, she would get upset, sometimes block me, and then telling me it hurts when i tried so hard and to hear how \"i changed, and i'm a bad person for leaving\"&amp;#x200B;I't took me a while to realize that i was causing the same person who was trying their best to save me from my own demons, so much of pain.&amp;#x200B;I'f i could go back in time, i'd rather suffer the pain and not tell her.We had a really bad fall out, and both her and my brother stopped talking to me.I still remember the words she told that still to this day makes me cry.\" I tried to help you but you don't listen anymore, and you keep doing the same thing, and i need to step back and i can't help you anymore\" when i heard those words, i lost all hope.This was when my brother and her went for graduation.I'm a shitty person, because i ruined her graduation weekend, by getting upset at her for ignoring me all of a sudden.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward, we go back home after graduation, both her and my brother left our house, and he went to stay with her and her family. Nobody spoke to me for almost a month. I felt like such a monster.&amp;#x200B;# My lowest point.I ended up emailing her, telling her a lot of bad things, how she quit on me, and that i feel like an evil person etc, and i told her i'm going to kill myself because i am in too much of pain.i really am a shitty person, i ended up taking a bunch of pills, and ended up in the hospital for 4 days. Since then we haven't talked as much, or whenever i mention my problems, she'd tell me to talk to my parents.&amp;#x200B;I don't blame her for diverting all the time, she has her own demons herself. I still don't know why she still talks to me. I know it's not the same person who use to go out of their way to help me. &amp;#x200B;We still talk these days, but it doesn't feel the same anymore, and i think today is the day i stop talking to her, and let her and my brother live their life.  &amp;#x200B;I don't want to cause anyone any pain anymore.&amp;#x200B;Nobody really tried like she did. I'll always appreciate it.&amp;#x200B;I'm sorry if my story is all over the place, i have no one to talk to, and i've been thinking of leaving this earth this past few weeks. It's been getting worse each and each day. My depression has completely taking over me. I struggle to take a shower, sometimes i don't shower for days.&amp;#x200B;I don't know what to do anymore?? i'm seriously thinking about ended it all, it feels like i can't breath anymore. I have no money, no job, no friends, (feels like i have no family) all i have is my demons. And i want them gone.&amp;#x200B;# More info if anyone is interested ( Psychologist, Medication)* I've been on may different antidepressants, but they didn't seem to work.* Also been to many different psychologist, many sessions, but i didn't feel any different about myself.* I've even been to group therapy for 2 weeks, after trying to take my life, but even that didn't help."}, {"sno": 77, "created": 1593902360.0, "title": "I just can’t do this anymore.

I didn’t take one of my exams ( a little one you don’t have to repeat the semester for it you can just take the class over the next year) and I had huge anxiety attacks after that and guilt that they will drop me out of the university.In fact I always have this huge irrational fear that I forgot something and I will be dropped out of med school.I lost some years due to the fact that I was too afraid to take exams and I couldn’t go. No confidence and it was a plus thing to come over and it totally took a toll on my mental health.Narcissistic parents especially my mother who is in hospital now and she constantly blackmails me psychologycally, talks bad things behind my back even to strangers, creates guilt in me, no support, nothing. She does the same to my brother who has the same problems as me.Ofc no relationship at the age of 25, never had anything serious or loving, only people who were kinda attracted to me. I think they sensed my lack of self confidence and weaknesses and they took advantage of it. Honestly I gave up the thought of a healthy loving relationship, I guess it will never find me, because how messed up I am or I am unlovable. Everybody is like wait for it and I am sure you will find somebody who deserves you but not really. I just cut ties with toxic guys. So nothing.Currently I am back in my hometown from university for a while and I have no friends here anymore. They moved out of town or we lost contact etc.I feel like I am uninteresting, unlovable mess, who constantly messes up everything and never will be happy.I am 25 and I have mental health issues since the age of 11-12 I guess but all my memories from my childhood are connected with anxiety.It just feels like that if I feel this shit at 25 and I felt shit during my whole life then how am I going to feel at 50 or 40? If I ever make it there.I am the bystander of my own life and it just passes and I can’t live only survive and it sucks. I don’t really find the meaning of life, I don’t have real friends, I realised many of them were or are toxic ones. I don’t feel anything positive, just I really feel like I have to survive. And life is just negative things nothing good ever happens. Only financial problems, health issues, backstabbing, losing a loved one, break ups, cheatings etc...And I also realised that you are only worth anything in this life if you have money, you aren’t really worthy oh no, it’s just your money. Every company is so nice and put this mask on how they support a noble cause ( like Coca Cola during pride month) but in reality it’s just all for money and they don’t really care. Or companies like H&amp;M ( how they are gonna make environment friendly clothes yet they have workers in India and Bangladesh who suffer to make end meets for a really bad salary working for 12-14 hours)It’s just hypocrisy.

So after we got married, I had to wait for 3 months in India to apply for visa and for it to get granted.

I had issues with my in-laws in those months and had shared it with my husband.I actually ignored them.We visit india once in a year or two. Every time we visit his parents , he tries to support them whenever we had issues. He wants them to be happy and comfortable and consoles me saying that it’s only for 3 to 5 weeks, please adjust.I have had very tramautising experiences mainly the one where he left me half way on the road and walked away with his mother, in his hometown.Last year his parents visited us and I had agreed for them to stay here for 3 months. They had visa for 1 year and continued staying here. I was uncomfortable many times and I had told my husband but he just let them stay.Now they are back to India.I raised my concerns with him and he apologised and said he would never do it again and he promised me that I don’t have to meet his parents again in future.He treats me really good(more like a princess) when it’s only us,but his behaviour changes when he is around his parents and sister.His sister and parents message him and they talk bad about me and he doesn’t give back.He just keeps quiet which is getting to my nerves.when confronted he says he gives back in his way and he can’t be me and behave like me. I just want him to take my side and tell them that we are a team and they have no rights to get inbetween us.I am sad most of the times and I have been annoying him recently. He doesn’t like when I am sad or cry. But just the thought of his parents/family boils my blood and I go into my cocoon . He keeps telling me that he is sorry for past but will make sure to correct in future.But from my past experiences I can’t trust him to stand up for me in front of his family and it’s killing me.He is annoyed coz, he listened to my concerns and has been working on it.But I can’t ignore the past and all these thoughts pops up my mind quite often.It’s really affecting our marriage and I am blaming myself for the whole situation. I am considering therapy but I just wanted to vent out to someone.PS: His parents are financially dependent on us. I don’t care supporting btheir expenses. But they just throw money to show off infront of relatives. We are starting a family and we don’t have enough to throw around.

Today I had to take a drug screen they do the urinalysis and for me they are extremely hard. I have to use a hat, I’m female, because of my stupid body. Then, I take what I call an anti pee pill. I have to take it otherwise the smallest amount of liquid going in causes me to basically piss my pants even if I’m just 5 feet away from the bathroom. As soon as the urge hits, it’s too late. Have had this problem since I was 7, am now 36 so I’ve taken a pill the last 10 years. I take 2 in the morning and 2 before bed. It typically causes a little issue doing a pee test but I can handle it. Today was not the day. I drank a lot on my way to the testing site, i then was like here we go. She didn’t want me to use the hat and I’m like legit I have to use it. Then you have 4 minutes to take the test. I’m like ok give me a time limit. Deer in headlights for the whole 4 minutes. Wasted that hat and cup. Get a 8oz bottle of water. I drink it and ask for another can’t have another until I pee or until 30 minutes later. So I feel the urge to go like I feel I’m going to potty in my pants I’m like yes let’s do this. Literally barely enough pee to fill a soda bottle cap. Like wtf is that. Tried again same shit and now they are out of hats so it’s a refusal to take the test. Lost that job due to refusing the drug screen. Then hear from a job that I did a 4 fucking interviews for that they moved on with someone else. Then, looked at my states job site of all the jobs for state gov jobs applied too have all been listed at “not selected” got email for one of them. So three in a matter of 2 hours plus the other 4 that were “not selected” but no notification yet. Like seriously this is weighing down on me. I want to work, I’m ready to work, I know this is a rough time as we are dealing with COVID but also that IT positions in my area had hundreds of applicants both locals and the out of staters that move here every day making it harder. Move here I don’t care, it’s just more experienced people in IT that will get jobs over me. I’m all about entry level right now.

I read that amineptine it is currently sold in India and Egypt.  I ask Indian and Egyptian users to check the current availability of this drug in these countries. anyone who knows a pharmacy, a small pharmaceutical industry that synthesizes it on commission or sell it, please let me know. I'm from Europe,but I saw that is possible to buy as a \"research purpose only\" molecule from private pharmaceutical companies in USA. Anyone can help?  if we join forces we can find it or have it produced, alone i can do little, only by passing from words to deeds, we can hope to get something. There are a lot of website of \"India markets\" that sell it, but they're all scams, that ask 100 or more dollars for 20 pills but didn't ship anything after receiving money, speculating on world's famine of amineptine. we have to collaborate and join forces, because this drug could be a life-saver. unfortunately it was withdrawn from the market because it really worked, and people were returning to their lives, ending up wasting money on unnecessary psychotherapy or ssri (check forums where users shares their experience with amineptine,it was amazing, more stamina, improved cognitive and memory, even better orgasm). this was unacceptable to lobbies, because a depressed patient is a client who spends money for life for ineffective treatments, and could not accept that people healed.  the reality is that amineptine was taking away the market from the ssri therefore it was withdrawn for phantom security reasons. I was visited by the best psychiatrist and neurologist,  working in hospitals and teaching at universities. They all said that to me, I'm not invent from my mind,they also told me that was amazing with parkinson too,without the dangerous sides of pramipexole for example. it was developed in France by Servier (the same company that produce stablon - tianeptine) and had a market share higher than the ssri.  the abuse problem was due to the fact that it was erroneously used in cocaine disaffection therapy, so cocaine addicts took huge quantities (10-20 grams per day) to try to recreate the same effect as cocaine. The lobbies used this fact to justify the withdrawal of amineptine. Consider that. ..have you ever seen a medicine withdrawn all over the world in the same moment for some abuse by cocaine addicts? Never happened...there are tons of harmful medication with hundreds of papers and studies demonstrating it, but still selled worldwide, even if patients and doctors know about the toxicity... and in any case we speak of very few cases, which do not concern depressed patients.  psychiatrists told me that bupropion it is used as a therapy for disaffection by cocaine too, and is taken by cocaine addicts shredded and then inhaled, but wasn't withdrawn from the market....For more info read thiswww.amineptine.com(The source indicated in this site however is not reliable,don't buy on it , don't waste money, it's a scam, i already tried and tested the shit selled and wasn't pure, with a lot of impurities, not for human consumption)"}, {"sno": 82, "created": 1593002380.0, "title": "I am depressed...

But the culture hurts people more than someone expects. I am a 19-year-old Indian in depression. I blame the culture and gender norms for my depression.The culture in India is so bad that parents **don't think** it's important for kids to have their privacy. I don't even have a lock for my room and my mom said she'd even tear down the walls for my room if necessary. Which I was and still am afraid that she'd do. I have been controlled by guilt, shame and with a word called \"respect\" all my life and compromise is not meeting in the middle but It's accepting all the demands and then choosing VERY FEW of the options now left for me which I am not interested in.I have so many things I'd like to say to all parents but they are not willing to listen. This is the same way many of our parents have been raised. Putting aside if it is the correct way or not, We are NOT stuck in the 1990s, we are in 2020, Please, I am NOT asking YOU to change, parents. I'm just asking you to let your children decide how they live in at least in a few parts of their life. Advice is always appreciated, so is your concern but that doesn't justify you threatening to do something that we find sadness in.My mom says \"You need to look after us when we get old.\" Which I got to admit is pretty common in Indian culture so she doesn't seem to think anything is wrong with it but I got a life that I didn't ask. I lived a life that was not mine. Everything that has happened is something that I didn't wish for. All I wished was that we stay happy as a family without any fights.I don't know when did our society forgot that children are their own person. Not a tool to compare marks with other parents. Not a pet to give commands. Parents and Adults expect us to act like adults while you treat us like children. You expect us to stay out of \"grown-up conversation\" when we try to be grown-ups, You make decisions without our consent then be angry if we do anything without your consent. I DO NOT think this is fair. How do you think this is fair? I like this quote \"I don't know how to act my age this is the first time I'm in it\". You can say just do as I say I have been your age, but you are/were not 19 years old in the year 2020.Times have changed, ways have changed, so many things have been invented to make our lives better but our mindset did not change. Please I have to ask you to not forget my experience and views. I have been hurt a lot and my priorities right now go like; Me, Internet/games, Parents. Yes. I like my internet and games more than my parents because I think if not for games and online friends, I'd have suicided in 9th grade itself, BECAUSE of my parents. I could say I hate them but they didn't know it was hurting me this bad, I didn't talk to them too. I don't think I can ever hate them but that also doesn't mean I can forgive them for what they did.

Promotion will be subject to onboard appraisal and even then there is no guarantee this was said by a superintendent who is a captain btw, one of the most negative persons you will ever met.Since Sep-19 I was trying for other companies , and luckily (or unluckily) My promotional thing was accepted by one of the largest ship management companies after clearing their interviews and all.Then in Feb-19 , I did their in house courses ,gave my documents etc. ,they have already lined up for a ship where joining would be in April. And thanks to Covid-19 , everything got fucked up. But then in end-may, Government of India  started giving permissions for charted flights specially for seafarers.

And after tonight, I think I am finally ready to stop fighting, and let whatever is going to happen, happen. 5 years ago, when I was 15, I lost my best friend to Leukaemia. I was still in school, and it caused me to spiral. I took days off, but I was able to stabilise myself, and finish school a year later. After I graduated, I missed out on University, because it cost too much. I quickly realised that University wasn't for me anyway, and I decided on my new career path. I started talking to this girl online in March of 2017. She was 4 years older than me, but she was the first girl that really showed any interest in me, so I jumped at the chance, despite not actually feeling ready. Problem was she lived in Croatia, and I live in Australia. We agreed to go long distance for a few months, meet in November, and work things out from there. I should have realised something was wrong from the fact that she never wanted to call. She never wanted to talk long term plans. I started talking to another girl in India, because of this. I was told by Croatian girl in June of 2017, that she had been seeing someone else the whole time, and the only reason she was talking to me is because I made her feel special. During our \"relationship\" my mum had a severe stroke to which she will never recover. She lives in a Nursing Home a fair drive away from where I live now. Just after Croatian girl and I ended, I entered a long distance relationship with the Indian girl, and for the first few months it was heaven, until the cracks started to show. She was very emotionally immature, which caused her to lash out in fits of anger, we tried for 2 years, (young, naive kids with no money) fighting nearly daily, before she just abruptly left. I had to come to grips with the fact she was gone, but my friends helped me get through it. Almost a year to the day after it ended, the girl reached out. She was apologetic, told me she was incredibly sorry for the pain she caused me, and that she had moved on and was happy. She also wanted to be friends. That hurt, but it was what it was, I had no interest in being her friend, because the feelings were still unresolved. Skip forward to my current issue. She reached out a few days ago telling me she needed my help. I, like the idiot I am, responded. She told me she wanted to do some stuff on YouTube and that was it. She called, we discussed it, and I told her that I have no interest in communicating any further. She told me she planned on moving here. For the last few days, I had been receiving mixed messages from her, one minute she loved me, and she wanted to try again, the next she was saying it would never happen. I allowed myself to get suckered in, allowed myself to believe that there was a chance I could get back with the woman I had always thought was my soulmate. We just had a big fight after I told her that I couldn't be her friend.

Ever since I was a kid I have been outcasted by ever group and have been bullied and falsely accused of shit I have never done only to be punished for it with no evidence. I have been all alone growing up in this world and I am still alone today. My parents have been abusive verbally and physically since I was a kid and even now they still are. I will just give you a couple examples.I was falsely accused of hurting a kid when I was 13. There was only one witness his friend and my principle believed him and when my parents found out they never even questioned it and my father beat me with a belt and I was expelled for a week. There have been other instances of similar stuff happening later on.As a kid my parents would say that I am a stupid dog who can't get anything right when I couldn't understand something in school or homework and because I am slow and unable to do things quickly.My parents are also toxic to each other and I would have to try to sleep at night with them yelling at each other.Anything I enjoyed or was good at was considered pointless to my parents. Such as video games, reading books or comics, drawing, music and computers. My father would try to take these items away from me many periods in my life as a way to punish me for not doing well in school. It never worked.In my first year in high school freshman year I decided to change myself and do better in my studies. By the end of the year I was able to get a 3.4 gpa which was a big improvement from my middle school years because during those times I never even did my work or pay attention in class. I believe the only reason I even did well was because my cousin lived with me during that time and he would support me that year and be a good friend. Unfortunately he left next year as he realized how toxic my family was and couldn't deal with them anymore. In 10th grade I completely stopped trying. My homework was never done and any tests I did was always 10 percent or less. My teacher realizing something was wrong and told my parents. My parents then abused me even more by yelling and cussing at me. They would come in my room without even knocking. I would block the door sometimes with an object only for them to bang on the door for 10 minutes before giving up. My dad once kicked the door open and broke it so the door was always open and I could hear them downstairs saying how terrible and annoying I was. I failed 10th that year.My grandfather during this time had cancer so my dad forced everyone to leave everything In the US and go to India despite me not wanting to go. He convinced me that we would be back within a few months. This was a lie and he forced me to go to a boarding school there. If you're not familiar on what that is its when you live inside the school. They took me to the school to apparently go check it out and see if I liked it. Of course I didn't. My dad told me he was going to use the bathroom. He never came back apparently I was signed up for the school without my knowledge. You couldn't try to escape either as there were walls around the entire school and guards constantly patrolling during the day and night. The school had disgusting living conditions with bed bugs and rats living in the dorms. The food was all vegetarian which I didn't mind other then the fact it was disgusting with mosquito bugs in it. I had lost a lot of weight living there as I almost completely stopped eating only eating white bread with jam on it at time to time. During the summer the place was extremely hot. They wouldn't turn on the air conditioning even though they had it. They said it was because it was too expensive. Which was a complete lie as they were getting money from parents of kids each month. Way more then they should by the way. I have literally seen people pass out from heat stroke because of how hot it got. The worst part was the bullying. I was in fights almost everyday usually with me being by myself with 4 or 5 others ganging up on me. I used to get stuff stolen from my locker, they had broken the lock multiple times to get in to steal food I saved like chips and juice which was rare to find in our school as it was only given out in special occasions. At night they would kick open on my door on purpose or bang on it very loudly to wake me up. The teachers and staff never did anything as they felt that I was being too sensitive.Now comes the part of the story that gets worse. I have never shared this to anyone. I was sexually harassed a lot at that school. When I would use the bathroom they would kick the door open to peek. They would make sexual remarks and asking me to do sexual favors for them and in return they would leave me alone. They would literally show their private parts to me on purpose and when that didn't work well......they tried to force themselves on me and of course I resisted and fought back. This happened multiple times during that year. Things got so bad that they threatened to kill me. I would stay awake at night scared for me life that they would come to my room and actually do it. With no sleep at night I would sleep during the day during classes and would get yelled at by the teachers. I tried multiple attempts to kill myself in that school. There used to be a building that was usually empty during break. I would go there and lean on the edge of the roof of the building just looking down gathering the courage to actually do it. No one cared no one listened not even my parents. They would come visit me time to time or call me on one of the staff phones but every time I would tell them the terrible things that happened they just ignored it. I never really told them about the sexual abuse I faced I was to scared to tell them.......I didn't think they would believe me and to this day I still haven't. Later on during the end of the year I convinced one of my family members to let me come home and take the bus instead. This only pissed off the people who hated me even more. During break they would come to my classroom or outside and harass me constantly telling me that if I ever told anyone what happened that they would hurt me or kill me if I they had the chance. One time when I was in the bathroom I was put In a choke hold from behind, I honestly believe he was going to kill me as he was enraged and shouting random nonsense that I couldn't understand, something about God wanting this to happen. Luckily some other kid came in who saw the entire thing and he let go of me and ran off. I eventually passed my classes despite doing no work or doing any homework that was given as the studies their were completely different then what I learned. It was a couple grades above my level like advanced psychics, chemistry, and calculus. When the exams came I clearly flunked them but apparently my dad paid the school to have someone else take them for me. The day I was suppose to go take the exams I refused too. My dad called a friend and another family member to force me to go take me to school. I had locked the door to my room and of course they kicked it open. They grabbed me and said they would do whatever it takes for me to go. They would undress me and make me put on the school uniform if they had too......they did try to do that but I caved in and followed their orders as I didn't want anyone to get hurt especially me. When I did finish 10th there I was stuck in India for another 3 months. During that time I realized that my mom and my brother and gone back to the US a month after I was put into that school. They never even told me they left. Apparently my brother was put into school in India too but didn't like it and within the first week they took him out without question. During that time I had multiple panic attacks that would happen late at night no one really bothered to ask what the screaming was about and would tell me to go to sleep. One night I had a really bad one and it lasted for a while one of my Aunts started slapping me for being insane this didn't help and made it worse eventually they left me alone and I was able to calm down. After 3 months I was suppose to go home to the US by myself. I have flown and traveled alone a couple times before so I was familiar with what to do. Of course my dad made an excuse and said I wouldn't be able to do it and told me to go with my aunt to the Philippines. This was of course a lie as a way for me to live there instead. I went anyway and ended up living with my uncle for a short time.When I was there I remember an incident that happened. I was yelled at my uncle who I was living with for apparently refusing to accept money from a family member who was there as it is a cultural custom to give money to someone who is way younger then you. I refused it because I felt that I was not going to spend it on anything and even if I did I would get yelled at for spending it on something stupid. I ended up living with a different family member the next day. one month later I finally came home to the US.I barely passed high school after that and fast forward to today those days still haunt me today. I have tried getting help over the years from meeting doctors therapists psychiatrists and psychologists. Therapy never really helped and I decided to take medication which only made me worse and have more mental breakdowns. I ended up becoming completely numb only feeling my depression and anxiety and over the years I have grown angry towards myself and the people who have hurt me. I have tried to suppress it but bottling up your emotions doesn't really help. I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was given 5 medications that I would take every day. One for the mania, one for my depression and anxiety, one for sleep, another one for a side effect of constantly shaking and one for extreme nausea. I had gained a lot of weight because of this and I now weigh around 200 pounds to my previous 160. The medication has helped a lot but I eventually stopped taking it because of the many side effects. I went to India again recently and stayed there for 2 months which was a bad idea and the only reason I did was because of family issues that were needed to be dealt with. This caused old painful memories to come back. I finally asked my dad why he even put in that school when I was there. He said it was because he wanted to make me stronger and learn to grow up and teach me a lesson.I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I live in confusion everyday. Nothing feels right and the things I used to enjoy just don't anymore. Even video games which I thought I would never lose interest in just aren't fun anymore. Nothing feels real anymore not even myself. My dreams feel more real to me then life itself. I know the stuff that happened to me isn't my fault but what am I suppose to do. Ya I can go work out or find a job or do a hobby or go to collage but whats the point if there is no emotion behind it? If there is no feeling behind it? If I just had one person In my life who believed me who would listen to me who cared for me who actually loved me that would be enough. But there is no one not even family. At this point I am convinced there is really no hope for some people. Its funny how people say how they got out of depression or mental illness and that you can do it to. Are you really sure about that....you never hear about the people who gave up on life because most people never got to hear their stories its only those who survive that really get to tell theirs. Not everyone gets an opportunity and even if you do there is no grantee you will succeed. How long do I have to keep walking I am tired so tired. Maybe I am wrong about the way I am looking at this but this is all i know. Thank you for staying this long to listen to my story and the fact you came this far means a lot to me. I was able to get a lot off my chest and I really do appreciate you for helping me do that. I really hope for the best for all of you.

I used to live in Dubai and I had spent almost all my life there. We had to leave our house because it belonged to the company my dad was working for. I felt sad and on the last day, leaving it all, I cried. Now fast forward to a few months later. It was inevitable that we had to come to India. I joined a new school and oh boy was it fun. Everyone was absolutely unfriendly to the \"new kid\". Also I all the new kids in my neighbourhood were friendly but not too much. School was a disaster. My dad was in depression. He talked about collective suicide in front of me. My mom once locked herself in a room with knife. Thus had a profound effect on me. Then everything slowly started to settle. Or so I thought. My dad picked himself up. I found new friends in school and the neighbourhood kids also started warming to me. Then the mid term exams came along. Me and my friends got average marks. This was devastating. My one friend blamed me for his marks and he stopped talking with me. That was rock bottom 1. You see I depended emotionally on my friends. I really don't know why. Also the neighbourhood kids now started treating me like shit. Everything was worse. Then some dude in school who I knew and was friendly with invited me to join his group of friends. And I thought it was a new start. It was all over. Again I was wrong. Slowly I established a good rapport with all of them. And at the end of 8th grade, I left school happily. Then 9th started and all of my friends at school now started to distance themselves. For some unknown reason. But slowly we again started showing the same signs of friendship. So it was all okay. I guess. But I didn't know that I was headed to something much worse. I became the butt of all jokes. At first it wasn't even that bad. But then they started getting much more personal. They weren't even jokes at that point. They were straight up insults. That was depressing. Also I had just recovered from low self esteem. I think I had it at least. So again this was a blow to my self confidence. My friends were completely insensitive to my condition. They knew by the way. I even showed self destructive tendencies. Yet they never even tried. Like I told I was emotionally dependent on my friends. You see 9th is an important year. So parental pressure was at an all time high. They would start pointing all the small mistakes, even if they weren't mistakes. The neighbourhood kids  started treating me like shit again because I couldn't play cricket well. That was the sport that all those guys played. So home wasn't a happy place . School wasn't a happy place. And anywhere else wasn't a happy place. Slowly I started descending into insanity or at least it felt like it. I was briefly suicidal in my 8th. But in my 9th it was much longer. I had a stupid ideology that I was talentless and useless. And if I am that, then I should just kill myself, right? So I tried that. Nobody ever told me that choking yourself doesn't kill you. So that is what I did. 3 different times. This was rock bottom 2. But things went on with their ups and downs. One day my friends at school took it too far. I was sad about it. My mom after some digging found out about the teasing. That is only because it would affect my studies and completely  ignored the mental effects. She told my dad. And then he called my friend and asked him never to talk to me again. This was devastating as I was emotionally dependent on my friends. And also everyone was like this guy's cronies. So if he stopped talking, everyone would. And that thought terrified me. My dad even swore at me for being such a wuss. But this was a blessing in disguise. As I regained my self esteem. And I found out about my dependency on my friends. So I was able to control it. After a few fights and setting boundaries with the neighbourhood kids, they finally started respected me. They understood I wouldn't take any shit. Now I'm in 10th. Most important year of school life. No parental pressure is almost unbearable. I still cry sometimes. I get average marks in my tests. I used to get good before. Whenever I get bad marks , I cry a lot. I even sometimes feel like killing myself. And also know these are small tests. What is wrong with me? Please someone tell me. My parents tell me counseling is useless. They think whatever they say is EXACTLY what the counsellet would say. I know they want the best for me. But their approach is dead wrong. For me, at least. They don't realize the impact their actions have on me. Am I the wrong one ? What should I change in myself ? Am I  just being melodramatic ? Am I being stupid ? Do I just want sympathy ?

Some say that its a Chinese bioweapon gone rogue , that's why chinese have denied access for the international probe.Some say that its the Chinese way of staying ahead of the US in terms of economy , because Chinese are far ahead in terms of covid timeline which gives them a jumpstart , as they resume operations when countries like India shuts down .Some say that its the US way of planting its own virus in china , in order to create a global hate , which in some sense has been achieved and inorder to disrupt the foreign economies , by taking advantage of other countries . Take for example : Facebook's investment in India , rise in Bezozs Wealth , Google domination , Microsoft pills. Some say that its a show of supremacy like if America shuts down , so will the entire world go down . Some say that Capitalism has brought this inorder to show that You are born and dead just to contribute your part in the overflated economy .

I don't smile , I don't cry , I don't have any emotions Its 2041 now , I guess , I don't knowIts just me and my face on the mirror , I don't know what is happening on the outside world , I don't know how are my parents are holding up physically , in the other rooms . They don't speak with each other too.. Probably they would also be staring at the mirror like me or they would have forgotten the fact that I still live . Because I myself don't know if they even exist.Its just a Photo that reminds me that I and my parents existed in this so called world i was born into, I still wonder why was I even born ?

It started with my sister , she was Covid positive , and after that , we were put in quarrentine , but I had a connection with the world then . I got the newspapers, the nurses told me stuffs . But after Some months everything stopped . I don't see the nurses too. Hope she's doing well. Hope she's aliveI have never seen or heard anything since then .The last time I heard about something in a very long time ,  was in 2036 when they said that they were shifting me because the place where I stayed had been affected by the rising water level and that half of Antarctica had swallowed up most of the major cites of the world.I don't know how the world is now .I don't know if my sister is alive or dead , the last time I saw her was when she was holding my hands in fear , I kissed her and told her that you'll come back soon and healthy .I think Covid was just first of its kind and after that many more, with power more infinite than its earlier impact , has taken a stroll on this insane world , with different outcomes . I wonder if there's a America or India now?Guess what if our prime minister is even alive ? I still don't know \" How do I still remain sane.\" After all these madness and Illusions I have been through.Its probably the drug injected food . Here I am still emotionless , staring at the same only mirror , with the hope that I could give my body its peace but all I can see in this empty room is that there's no means to end my meaningless life , rotted by the selfishness of some people who run or think that they run this empty world .

But it didn’t fulfill me.

Also it was a super attractive option for me to be working for my business (albeit my dad’s but it wouldn’t feel like a job) came back.

I am 19 years old(20 in September),in 1st year of engineering in India. Since 2016(11th grade),somehow I have done just nothing. I had been an above average student,  but somehow I just started procrastinating,being completely shy, introvert and turned into a complete daydreamer.My grades started getting worse, started failing subjects, started having hair loss, getting fat, no personal life or relationships.2016 and 2017 just went by procrastinating, academically failure, and simply just blank. I used to just sit with an open book and just couldn't study, used to play football, used to read novels, but just wouldn't felt like doing, the only I wanted was to just sit in my room and do nothing. So by 2018 I finished  school with low grades,  failed all entrance exams, for the universities I wanted to go. So In 2018 I decided to just take a gap, and to get out of the the mental hell I have put myself into. I realised I was depressed  .Being 18 with no aim,no specific talent, academically failure, from a financially mediocre family so nothing like ever I have spend money on myself and father also retired, and shy person I was,  forget girlfriend,i don't think I even Know a girl whom I can call a friend.Many times I have cried myself to sleep. Realising what a person I have become,  I just felt suicidal. The only reason I didnt do it probably was, all the things I was going through were my own fucking problems.Like I never gone through any physical or mental abuse, never have done drugs, smoking or alcohol, and have decent loving parents.Just a normal guy,but somehow over thinking I turned myself into a loser.But I just accepted the fact that I am depressed,  but suicide is just isn't options.I just accepted that I am not going to have the best life I thought of,  but the least now I wanted was to get financially get stable,  to support me and family. I accepted that being with a girl or having a relationship is just not my cup of tea and just decided that from now on I just focus on studies and go through university,  get a job and live on my own. In 2019 I joined a mediocre college(engineering), and somehow accepting what I can have,  what I cannot has helped a lot,  but It just becomes difficult to study things which you actually don't like but u just have to do,  cuz you have failed earthing others. Somehow 2019 went by passing semester somehow, at least one thing to get pleased,but if I'll be true to myself,  I myself know that I am not happy. I wake up sulking knowing another day of doing things which I don't want to,  but somehow I have to. But by March 2020 I have felt really interested in studing computer science, and with that the start of lock down,  I decided to do online courses so as to get my appropriate skills and improve my resume.But because old habits don't go so easily,  today it's April 26 and I haven't studied single line the whole time,  just have procrastinated everything.I don't know how to say but I just feel so bad of myself. Right now,  I want to just forget all the past and  focus all my time for studying and probably in 2-3 years get a job,  and that's reason I wrote all of this, I want to start fresh.Hope writing this helps me."}, {"sno": 105, "created": 1587471139.0, "title": "I'm at the end", "selftext": "This is long. I am sorry. If you read through this and leave me a comment, I will make a donation to a mental health charity, clinic or research facility. I have some spare money and this might help someone. This long mindvomit is not urgent. I just felt like I needed to 'diary' it. I have been diagnosed with a depression and anxiety disorder.  Depression runs in my family, even my great grandma was in an institution. I had my first incident with depression in my childhood, around 12 years old. 12 years old life was good. Had friends, played guitar, rode skateboard , read books, started learning computers. But suddenly it all stopped. Didn't bring a notepad to school. no pen. no bag. stopped caring. Stopped everything, became empty. Went to a psych ward, where I was diagnosed with the above.Then trying to hide the reality of me being 'insane' and trying to forget, fit in and never to repeat, please.Second bout od hardcore depression came two years ago, after I burned out from work. Afterwards, me and my girlfriend have traveled the world. Trips of a lifetime for most. Asia, America, Europe. Amazing experiences for most . And I only had like 5 seconds of hapiness after all the experinces and achievments we had. (ie. we trekked 15 days to see a specific vista in Himalayas). My mind just doesn't care. I have lost the light taht keeps people going. I just smile and nod to make my gf happy. She is ecstatic. I don't want to destroy her hapiness. I fake my emotions, because I am empty inside.I am now medicated by cipralex. It took away some  of my anxiety and left me kinda without the everlasting pressure in my chest and left me emptier than I thought it would. It left me scared and tired.Previous medication left me impotent and tired.Work is good, they know my condition. They understand it. I am a software developer. I can work when I feel like it and make enough to keep me going.Love of my life is with me for 13 years and we are planning a wedding and children.I just came back from my friend's flat, where I kidnapped all of the possible conversation and just twisted it to talk about my depression. I am sorry I destroyed a pottentianly fun evening. Every topic I kidnapped and destroyed. In the end I had to beg them to stop me. My gf is getting overworked and because of my melancholic passivity, she's showing signs of depression too. (depressed feelings, not clincal) I am sure she got it from me.. She cries, nothing excites her. I can't make a fun schedule I'd be able to follow and make her happy. Our relationship, which is basically the only thing that is worth something in my life is slipping through my fingers.I tried everything I could find about making your life better. I joined a gym, I went to therapy. I talked to my family. I am on my third psychiatrist and fifth medication. I ran every day. I tried interminent fasting. I went to India to practice yoga and also meditation. All of these things I forced myself to stick with for atleast three months. Most of the time it stressed me so much I coulndn't sleep the night before whatever I was supposed to the next day rendering it useless.Lately, I wake up every day with a vivid image of me with a noose around my neck, rope swung around a tree branch, the other end hanging in front of me. I am trying to climb the other end. This situation comes up before me brain boots up. It is buried in my subconscience. I never realistically thought of killing myself. But the image is there every day. It doesn't even physically work. You can't lift yourself trying to climb the other end. Still I wake up and it is burned into my mind. I am laying in bed kinda paralyzed, my limbs heavy in a meditative state which I didn't attempt. I lay there, kinda sleeping , kinda awake, contemplating the physical paradox of trying to climb the other end and somehow maybe hanging myself. If I am not forced from bed, I do that for 2 or more hours until I need to pee. I'm not gonna kill myself , never thought I would. It's gonna get better. Life can be fun.I started drinking heavily, just to feel something. I started smoking for whatever stupid reason. I got introduced to cocaine, which I never thought I would come into contact with.I stopped being able to do even the minimal amount of work I am supposed to do. I go to my personal office, I freak out, that I should be doing something. I smoke a shitton of cancersticks, drink rum, get angry at myself for wrecking my productive day, do cocaine to start working... aaaand repeat all of the above. This became my daily schedule. I am not yet addicted heavily. If I leave this routine, I don't have to smoke, drink or do drugs. But when left with my own devices, I numb myself, trying to get an emotion, which would be fake anyway. But I just fuck myself up, knowing I shouldn't, before, knowing I shouldn't have after. Then do the same the next day. This might look regular to some, but I am abusing everything right now, puking at 3pm in my own office.  Worst is, the next day, I try destroy myself again. I am on a trajectory to hell. I am gonna wreck myself.But weirdly, when I thought of all the destructive shit I am doing, I found solace and hope in the final result.I am gonna destroy myself into nothing. Place, from which is no other way than up.I am gonna drink until I puke. I am gonna smoke until I am sick. I am gonna do the line and hate myself. I will become the worst bundle of shit the world has ever seen. And then I will start anew.And then appreciate everything but the above .-------I showered - good, atleast you didnt drink all day, masking problems, trying to find an emotion.I cooked - good, atleast I did something productive and didn't smoke a pack trying to kill myself with cancer.I went for a walk - good, atleast I didn't do hard drugs, lying to myself I need it just to do my job.--------I know this is a wrong, bad idea, but it is where I am heading. I just need to hang onto something real before I get there. But will I? What do I want to hear from you? Is there anything that can possibly enlighten or help me here? I am probably just spilling my story here, just to be heard.EDIT: bunch of typos, am on mobile."}, {"sno": 106, "created": 1587253040.0, "title": "Please Help me", "selftext": "I have abusive parents, they fight with each other, my family is fucked up all are selfish and we are divided due to family conflicts, i haven't seen my cousin sister 5 years younger to me for 1 year I really miss her this is due to family conflicts again.

I tried to create a group for anyone who wants to work/study with other people because I personally find it easier and more motivating. I want to ask you to help me with studying and I will help you in return. I bought a premium on zoom so that we can have 24/7 study meetings non-stop, join and leave whenever you want (not gonna charge anything for this at all, never-ever). This zoom study room was created just a few days ago and it already had 2 meetings with wonderful and positive people from around the world: Australia, United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, India, France, Italy, United States and more. Right now there are more than 130 participants which join meetings using video at convenient for them time, so someone is always online and working.In addition, I know how hard this can be in times of complete lockdown... I couldn't properly study for last 3 weeks, since the beginning of the quarantine. During my university times I used to go to the library all the time, and now this, without seeing friends, family, loved ones for weeks (I am an international student). Honestly speaking, so far zoom helped me a bit, at least when I seat and turn my video on - I actually start working by seeing that other people are also working.

Fast forward to a few months later, then the crap started. I was bullied, a lot, A LOT, everyday it was for a new reason. We have a small race here in India called the Tamilians, and I lived in a city where people from the same heritage were hated ( for this and many other reasons I did not know), and every single day I was bullied to death, beaten up, verbally abused for absolutely no reason at all. Every single day in school was hell to me. Some people miss their school, i am afraid of mine. Nobody was ever friends with me, so one day I made up a story about having visited and resided in the USA, for some reason everybody suddenly wanted to talk to me, asked me about how it was, for once I had people who wanted to talk to me. So I continued forging story after story, filled end to end with lies, and never stopped. To this day people know me as someone who's partially American. I was never really good at anything, at all, no sports, I play video games with a few friends, but I'm always made fun of because I suck. Everytime I try to soul my guys about why I'm sad I get labelled as an attention seeker or sympathy seeker and get made fun of and ignored again. Until today I haven't done a single thing that makes my parents proud to state the fact that I am their son, I've always ended up disappointing my father, who worked very very hard to bring us to the comfort we have now. You don't even have to ask me about my love life, topping this all off with around 12-14 rejections all from various diff girls. All I ever want is for people to like me and consider me as a friend. I have never had someone who I can call my best friend, and he or she the same. Havent had anyone except family show any sort of concern about me. I'm 19 now, and I am still made fun of all the time, still lonely, still powerless, still, a loser. I've always had dreams or goals, but I could never achieve them, my mother thought I was messed up in the head and took me through a psych analysis. People always roast me or make fun of me for trying to live off pity. So I've decided that I don't need pity if I am frickin dead. I'm almost rock solid about my decision to kill myself.If you were in such a situation, what would you do ?

I made the mistake of talking to her about my issues... only at a surface level, like how I'm feeling hopeless and anxious over my career. Bad Idea. The moment she said \"you'll never get better if you think like this\", I told her that her honesty is nice, but I'd appreciate it if she doesn't talk like that. She didn't take it well, and just unloaded on me (she's a hot-head, and winds up saying things she sometimes regrets). Long story short, she just said she's \"sorry for trying to help\", and that I should see a professional, because she can't talk to me.

From a long time, especially the last 2 months, i have been really depressed and anxious about the future. I have a 16 y/o sister, whom i really love and care about. From last 1.5 year, she has been in a relationship with a boy who is 1 year older than me. My mother knows about this relationship, and she had no option, but to support it. My father, however, is completely unaware of this, and thinks that his daughter is very \"good\" in that sense. Both my father and my sister's boyfriend are complete bigots and full on narcissists. If my father got cognizant of the hidden relationship, he will do things, that even upon thinking, i hyperventilate and get anxious. On the other hand, my sister's bf constantly blackmails her into keeping up the relationship, that she is now REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN. However, i don't think that he blackmails for other more private stuff.  The basis of his blackmail is that he will tell my father about the whole relationship thing. Which, consequently, will make us all (me, my mother, my sister) liars in his eyes, which is BAD, SERIOUSLY BAD. My anxiety is crippling me, i am all the time tired, no motivations and no will to fight. It's like i am imploding, not exploding: i don't cry at all, i just sit and my body feels like it's getting more and more hollow. We run a pharmaceutical business, so after some research, i self prescribed a dose of pregabalin to reduce anxiety, without the need of acquiring a prescription. I have been taking it for like 5 days and it is showing lil effects. In January, most probably, her bf will go to Canada for study purposes, which will subside this whole mess. As of now, he has made attempts to call my father to tell him about all that, but he never said anything on phone, and just hanged up the call. There are less chances of him actually calling my father, cos he knows that it will certainly end the relationship. My sister is not at all interested in the relationship. She never ever complaints thought, thinking that it would make my mother and me anxious. She is very brave. Truly. My mother, who has suffered all her life from my ass father, also gets anxious and worried about the future. She also suffers from migraines, so more stress causes real bad headaches. Both of them are very brave and they are fighting for what could happen. But, I am not, I get super scared and anxious when all this happens. I don't know how to normalize, and feel ok. It's like eating me. Sometimes i think of real bad stuff happening to both the bigots, and sometimes i feel as cuffed and restrained. I know it's not life and death matter, but it's certainly not comfortable also. There is this fear that always lingers, about what would happen.

So I'm posting it here.Hi,I want to share a secret which is killing me. I don't have anyone right now.... So I'm posting it here.6Years ago I met this girl who later became my best best friend. We were inseparable. People often taught that we were a couple. When I met her she told me that she was out of a \"bad and controlling relationship\". Other than that everything was normal.3 Years after that we were even more close. I started developing feelings for her,at first it was really confusing and I had to keep quiet because she is from an orthodox bramin(cast) family. If they ever find out that she is dating a non bramin they would kick her out. I just suppressed my feelings untill we both were about to graduate.Just few months before our graduation. The way she spoke felt like signals... Anybody would say thay they were signals.\" I like you, I love you, I hope I can stay with you, I really feel safe with you\". So I tought that she really likes me too and  I told her that I like her and I would like to take her out on a date. She abruptly rejected me and told me that \" Sorry if you have taken my friendship the wrong way, it's on me...I'm really sorry\".Because of everything that happened before... the way we were... Idiot me didn't understand the situation and tought that she is just afraid of her family(This situation often happens in India). So after a lot of discussion we came to a conclusion. The idea was something like \"if I can get into an IIT (India's best tech school) I would get to ask her on a date.\" ~ Which roughly translates to, get successful and you might get me.That day was the happiest day of my life. I tough thay she is afraid of her family... and guess what she is !!! Why else would she say thay I'll get a date if I get into an IIT.Fast forward, I'm still working hard everyday just so that I can be with her. I truly loved her 🥺. She was my one true love. I spent most of my time with her chatting.Just days before my exam I figured out something really gruesome. She still loves her EX. She had to break up with him because her parents didn't accept his cast.But still she loves him and is waiting for him. I FELT BROKEN... EVERYTHING WAS A LIE.... She could have told me that she likes someone else. Insted she gave me a fake promise. THAT MOMENT I REALISED THAT I WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMOTIONAL REPLACEMENT.She apologized to me and told me that she didn't tell it to anyone and it is a secret. It felt like the person I loved doesn't exist in this reality all of this just was just a drama. I didn't have anyone... I can't tell my mom because she is already messed up. And friends... She is my best friend 😢. Exam was done I messed it up, I joined one of the best colleges in my country but. Unsatisfied I just moved what I had.About her, I just accepted the fact that it happened and still wanted her in my life. We were still talking and I was getting over her... I went on some dates met some awesome people. It was all nice. UNTILL one day I got a call from her.... She happily told me \"I got back with my boy friend \". She didn't even care about my feelings. Shit stared happening I got into depressed and often get panic attacks...  Dropped out of college. All of a sudden the successful smart guy became nothing.I recently told her not to contact me anymore... I do not feel good. I am hollow. I want to hurt myself for being an idiot. I cry everynight thinking about this.I have no friends, no girl friend , I lost my career. While she is happy... She is really happy. I wanted to say this to someone. I know it will get better with time... But I feel betrayed. I just die and haunt her forever 😭😭😭😭Edit : Hey, People !! it's been few weeks and I am really fine and happy now. I am working on myself, I'm sure that I'll be even more happy in future.Thank you for all your love.Edit 2: Oct 2020Hey people... I was at the lowest point of my life when I wrote this post.it has been few months since I wrote it  so I just wanted to come back and write what is going on with my life... it might help someone who is going through the same situation.In my previous edit I mentioned that I am working on myself, guess what !!! It worked out, I got into one of India's top 10 tech Institute [fyi the previous college that I dropped out of had a national ranking below 50]. I am soo happy that strangers online help me get out of my shitty depression. Now I am kind of scared of girls/relationship..  I have a hard time trusting them... But I'm sure that things will get better with time. I am also planing for migration to another country. I am really happy now.... ***The one who is reading this right now, if you are sad and your life is fucked up, don't worry things will get better.... just work hard***"}, {"sno": 114, "created": 1585630235.0, "title": "need a lesson", "selftext": "hi this is my first post here .
