"selftext": "I'm a 17 year old student from India preparing for an extremely competitive exam. I used to be a really good student until covid happened. Before covid, I was one of those students that just got grades without studying much. After covid, I sort of just let go and my life was so boring and I was so demotivated that I couldn't seem to focus or take interest in anything. Mid September I had a huge panic attack. I was so overwhelmed about all the time that I wasted, I started crying and I couldn't stop. I studied harder than I've ever studied in my life. I put in 16 (sometimes 18-19) hours of work a day and I just didn't feel like I deserved to eat or sleep because of all the time I had previously wasted. The more I studied, the worse my grades got. And this is still happening. I led myself on to believe that I can do this. I changed my study pattern, time, Material, etc. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP. talked to my teachers about it. They just tell me to not be stressed. Like it's just that easy. I constantly have thoughts of self harm and I just see no way through this. Btw I'm studying for something that I genuinely have interest in. I'm even scared to open my books because I know I'll get questions wrong and just have a breakdown. This fear has grown so big that I actually threw up one day because of how stresed I was. My hands start shaking when I'm giving a mock test. I'm just so tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm so sick of feeling so shitty all the time.",
