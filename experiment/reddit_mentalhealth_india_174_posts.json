        "title": "Guy tried to kill a goat at a child marriage in India to try and curse the ceremony and stop the illegal marriage without calling the cops.",
        "selftext": "A close friend I had since highschool, went in India for a year as a volunteer working with an NGO. This NGO was advocating for girls education around the world and against analphabetism and child marriages.This story he didn't told me himself first his family did, but we were eventually able to talk about it together. He is better now but quite traumatized I think he spend a lot of his time alone in his room just doing nothing and depression.He was giving free English lessons to kids although he wasn't a teacher (no diploma). Untouchable Kids from a very poor and difficult background.After like 8 month there one of the girl from his class got forced into child marriage by her family she was only 15 years old and wanted to study to become a doctor.The context is that apparently this is a very common custom /tradition in some of the rural backward area  in India. Where girls aged from 13 to 18 are married to significantly older men aged around 18 to 30 (And it also happens in many other countries I'm not trying to specifically point a finger only at India here.)The girl was the daughter of the handyman and school janitor who where living in a house at the school doors as \"guardians\" supposed to control who goes in and out of the school. The ironyWell on the day of the marriage he wasn't told it was going to happen not by the local staff of the school who knew it was going to happen and told no one.They even all waited for the founder of the NGO to be gone and he wasn't around town he was gone for a vacation with his wife that week. And so random people with fancy clothes started to come onto the school ground slowly from 20 people to About 60/70 people from the village and other people from the groom family.The old men sat in a circle and the women from the village started singing. Traditions and shit. It's at this moment he realised that something was off and that things like that wasn't supposed to happen on the school ground so he looked for the local staff and asked them what was going on and they were his Indian friends so they told him.And he just lost it at this moment he felt so betrayed and lied to. he insulted everyone and cursed everyone even threw the Prasad in the trash.Went to find the girl she was locked up in a room with another volontier was crying her souls out with fear and disper.He called the founder and head master of the organization and asked him for help the guy answered he was busy and too far away. The girls family were his friends and the school staff too so he didn't want to call the cops on them.Would also possibly mean the closing of the school.So he grabbed a bad handmade foldable knife without people noticing from his stuff. First Went to the neighbors field and caught a goat from the herd Went back in the school over the wall still carrying the animal and proceeded to murder this goat in front of the cheerful crowd while cursing them to hell. The goat actually didn't die though apparently had to get stitched up at the veterinary and was probably traumatized for life. But the girl also didn't marry that year. What is the real better option also dialogue with the family wasn't leading anywhere the  father being a backward alcoholic and violent.After that he was expelled and flew straight back home. The marriage didn't happen that year but the girl could be married now even him, he doesn't know.With corrona and confinement the people from the NGO couldn't stay on Indian ground.After that he was really wrecked and didn't see much people he was obsessed with this and was always trying to figure out a way that he would have saved the day without using such violent \"solutions\".He also went to a psychiatrist because he thought he was psychotic or something.What do you think of this ? What would you have hypoteticly done in this situation ? Do you think he is crazy ? Or do you think he lost control but still was right in a way ? Pretty long text but I think it's hard to understand if you don't have at least that much context."

        "title": "I think I might be on the spectrum, though one psychiatrist has dismissed it as overthinking on my part. If I actually am, is there any use of getting an adult diagnosis in India? Or will it make things even more restrictive?",
        "selftext": "I have been assessed as showing some schizoid traits (introverted nature, inability/lack of interest to connect with others beyond a superficial level, muted reactions, in general tending to keep events/thoughts to myself and often not sharing even with immediate family because I think it is unnecessary and often getting scolded for this) though not severe enough for a personality disorder, plus anxiety which has been present and increasing since a few years now due to severe career confusion and indecision and fear of becoming professionally irrelevant.There are a few reasons I think I might be on the spectrum, listed below. I know that self-assessment is not recommended. I had tried discussing some of these points with a psychiatrist recently, but he dismissed them as overthinking without going through all of it, and also said that even if I was on the spectrum, 'the problems end around the adolescent/early teenage years and don't suddenly come up in your early 30s', despite my mentioning that confusion/physical awkwardness/asocial nature were always around since childhood. This was not the same person who had done the schizoid/anxiety assessment a few months ago. I have had issues with depression and have taken meds briefly because of some severe stress I faced a few years ago, but multiple therapists since then have pretty much focused on the depression aspect and not really looked into the pre existing issues (except for one of those generic suggestions like making pros vs cons lists).**Asocial nature, solo activities:** Always immersed in things like sketching, reading or playing with blocks/action figures as a child. Also spend to use quite some time reading books and illustrated books on how different machines work and other 'general knowledge' related things. Used to go for some activities for 2-3 years around age 10-12, then football for quite a few years, but rather than making friends, some of these activities turned into brief obsessions (horses for example was a pretty strong one for a few months, so was writing down lists of players in different teams). Playing with a couple of friends/myself often involved creating modified scenarios from cartoons etc around age 11-12. For a brief couple of years in college and just before, I was \\*very\\* outgoing, made a lot of friends, but ended up being ignored by pretty much all of them as I didn't try to restrict myself to a single group (maybe I was trying to fit in with too many different sets of people?) - and also hated the fact that they couldn't even show simple courtesy, for example of informing me of changes in plans we had made (where the f\\*\\*\\* is that 'empathy' which everyone exemplifies?), not even occasionally giving me a phone call (why should I ALWAYS be the one who makes the call?). Have no problems with meeting relatives/participating with others in large groups/functions etc, but never feel like talking too much to others. Now am pretty much asocial and typically have no problems with it except when I constantly get talked down about not being social enough and it being a major reason for my career issues (as if the constant misguidance and invalidation of my, in hindsight, reasonable thoughts by you had no role to play in it).**Interests - sketching:** Frequently drew only a small number of specific objects as a small child (around age 3), then some specific vehicles, then planes (after my first ever air journey), then trains, then 3-4 selected animals, in phases, and always found it difficult to draw anything apart from the 'in-phase' thing. Always used to get a lot of praise because of how accurately I was able to sketch these things. Lost interest in sketching after appearing for a couple of exams and getting decent grades in them. Tried to restart after my 12th, did it for a little while (not even a few months) and gave up again because I felt I just couldn't go beyond some very limited things.**Interests - maps:** Reading and drawing maps from atlases as a kid, several flags and capitals/cities memorized, creating imaginary ones, now surfing Google Maps and often looking for public transport routes in metro cities. I have lived in multiple metro cities for small durations (work, internships etc) and can still remember names and approximate locations of areas I have never ever visited.**Interests - trains:** As a kid I used to get extremely engrossed in railway routes and timetables, and even today am familiar with names and approximate locations of several places and trains. Also interested in the actual trains themselves, with the interest taking up an added angle as I studied electrical engineering. I still sometimes watch random train videos etc.**Others:** If something new interests me, I can suddenly immerse myself into it for a few days and then I quickly lose interest in it and give it up. A couple of psychiatrists have said that changing interests is quite normal, but I am concerned about the intensity when they are 'on' and the rate at which they wear off, so am a bit worried about my inability to sustain things in the longer run (especially about careers). Sometimes there is this impulsiveness when I suddenly want to do a lot of things, start off with a number of them and give up on all of them. But some interests, such as trains, maps and even an interest in languages/wordplay, have always lingered on. Have always liked music, but right now it is restricted to only a few selected songs/artistes. Haven't really 'updated' beyond the early 2010s.**Physical/body related:** There are some body movements and habits - a long-term one in scratching/fondling my scalp, a phase in childhood when I was frequently scolded for blinking my eyes in an unusual manner, a brief phase when I used to tense some of my facial muscles, and most recent ones in the form of abdominal muscle/shoulder tensing/vibrating. The abdominal twitching was noted as 'fidgeting behaviour' and formed part of the anxiety diagnosis. Around age 12-14, many people used to remark that I walk with a bit of a limp, with the remarks and probable motion defect reducing to much more subtle levels around college time. Sometimes I find myself in awkward positions, for example when I am doing some work and have to handle multiple objects, I sort of get confused in figuring out how to hold which object, how to adjust multiple things - it takes me too long to realise that I can simply keep one/two objects aside for the time being and focus on the rest. My handwriting is poor and messy and I sometimes feel awkward when handling tools, but I never faced any problems while handling tiny Lego blocks.**Confusion/indecisiveness/double checking/overthinking/time management:** I always feel I don't know enough and want to find out more. Constant career indecision is now troubling me more as I have been introduced to many more possibilities, but given my age it is also a question of whether anyone would be give me a chance (already rejected for entry level jobs, before and throughout Covid) without a massive pay cut (already a somewhat low salary, though sufficient; but non-software entry level pay scales are \\*abysmal\\*) as it is of my willingness to try out something. When writing an email I always think a lot about my words, and sometimes need to ask another person if they think it's OK even for simple issues. I have been told on a few occasions that I am not able to express my thoughts clearly, and I do get confused and fumble under pressure or when suddenly put into the spotlight, though many also say that I make solid, brief and powerful statements when I do say something. There are often situations when I get scolded because there is a simple, common sense solution that I wasn't able to think of; there are also occasions when I myself question why I did what I did despite that lingering feeling saying that something seems off. These things often result in wastage of time, which brings me to time management issues and of late, wanting to multitask and not being able to accomplish any of the multiple tasks as a result, then again feeling the need to 'cool down' and losing more time in the process. This issue was noted in the assessment as 'problems with time management at work due to large number of interests', which is not the case as career indecision is the only thing causing me problems with career, while actually having no/minimal impact on my work output. I sometimes find myself lost in fantasizing over what might have been had things turned out differently at some select points in my life. I face several situations where I feel the need to check, double check and recheck, tending to sometimes miss out things and panic at the last moment regardless.\\*Realised that I spent over two hours writing and revising all this\\*Now if I do happen to be on the spectrum, is there any point in trying to get evaluated and get an official diagnosis **in India**? If I do get diagnosed as being on the spectrum, what kind of options would I have in terms of support, careers etc?"

People love to show off that they care about others by posting it on their Instagram stories, but in reality, they hate negative and toxic people around. Every since I was a kid, I was taught one thing that you have to excel in academics or else you'll never get a chance which I think to some extent is true. But I have been doing that from a very long time; my parents enrolled me in a coaching institute from 8th grade onwards because they thought it'd help me prepare for the IIT exam. To some extent it did, I worked my ass off for those 5 years and sacrificed every possible form of enjoyment thinking that college will be a place to relax and do things at my pace and landed up in a good college. I was so wrong; when I entered college, I found there's another race that I have to run, and that is, getting a good job offer. As usual, I again sacrificed everything and worked hard for 5 long years, and I finally got a good job offer, but then COVID happened, and I lost it. Like any other individual, I motivated myself to work again, sacrificing every bit of my social life, and after 8 months of working hard with no results, I give up. I don't want to breathe a tiny bit of oxygen anymore. I have lost everything, and nothing good will happen now. Any positivity I see on the internet seems like a toxic positivity to me. Death seems like an award to me."

I also worry about little things a lot and take them very seriously and get tensed or stressed. So now the doctor has given me medication which is Rexipra 5 mg escitalopram once a day and propanolol Hydrochloride 20 mg twice a day and Clonazepam 0.25 mg twice a day. Since the day I have taken the doses I'm feeling pretty good and my head is clear never felt like it. But the main problem started when I looked into the drugs read the information about them and it says that some SSRI increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and depression and anxiety. Now I'm again worried about these effects it's been only 3 days and I'm feeling pretty good but I don't want to feel suicidal. The doctor also told me that the doses are minimal but I want help as I worry a lot as you can see I'm typing this. Please do help we with your opinion I need help. Hopefully you guys can give me some advice.\u2764\ufe0f"

I had changed schools about 8 times by that time and in 6th grade Itself I had changed school 3 times. It meant I had a lot of trouble making friends: i never tried to make lasting friendships as in the end I would always leave the school. I actually had about one friend for most of that time which let me to get isolated pretty bad. I used to never show my feelings so I tending to be \u201cpranked\u201d on a lot as they though I could take it with me boiling inside in despair trying to tell them to stop but too scared to say so due to my lack of social skills.It was in this environment that dark thoughts started to brew in me. I had almost no energy or drive to do anything. For a long time I though I was just lazy and I stated to hate myself for it. I hated myself for my \u201cself pity\u201d as a teacher of mine put it; Getting lost in downward tangents and getting just about nothing done. Hours pass by with a single book page open and me just reading the same paragraph over and over without understanding a word. Everything started feeling... grey for a lack of a better word and I kept blaming my self for being this useless.   And to add salt to injury, my family members kept talking about how smart I was and kept comparing me with my cousins and stuff. I felt guilty of not meeting my parents expectations but no matter how hard I tried, my willpower crumbled like dust.It was only about 2 years ago that i learned that I might be depressed. Now flash forward to this year when I finally made up my mind and told my parents about all my issues... and they didn\u2019t believe me. Or at least even if they did they forgot about it in under 3 to 4 days. How do I convince them that I have a very serious and very real problem. I spent about a hour yesterday after a rather big mental breakdown alone in my room with a packet of migraine painkillers and a plan. I am scared and I need help but I don\u2019t know what to do."

There is also the narrative of people close to him saying, \"he could not have been depressed since he was a very positive and cheerful person.\" That shows how clearly misunderstood the mental health issues are in our country; while we have come a long way, there is still a lot of stigma attached. Now, nobody is going to know if it is actually a suicide, or if it was abetment of suicide (which is a term I have only seen used in the Indian context. Until 2017, suicide was a crime in India, but abetment of suicide still stays and people look for reasons to put the blame on someone else) or if it was actually a well planned murder.What is your opinion on it? And have you been as affected with it as I have been, because of the way it has been covered by the media, and the way people have reacted (and are still reacting) to it?P.S.: I have posted the same question on the India Mental Health community."

I wish I had more friends to hang out with and often meet, to maybe gain a different perspective or just clear my head.

        "selftext": "I am a student of Law from India. I have a problem that I have been facing for years. Loneliness. Firstly in the start I took therapy and it was all about my lack of self love that I found myself utterly miserable in college. Further, I live at home, so both parents, who are lawyers themselves, go out leaving me alone at home. After college ended I knew that now was not the time to sit and think about my situation and mental health. It would be better that I study and get admission for my post graduation and get out of my house so that I may find a new environment. This was the same thing my therapist advised me as well. But as well all know Corona happened. Entrance exams got postponed. So that time went well for me. I decided that it's a golden opportunity and I have now ample to study. Plus all my friends were free themselves. Therefore I didn't felt lonely at that time. I being overconfident that I only need to focus on a single entrance exam, didn't apply for other colleges which were less prestigious despite of the fact my friends suggested otherwise. I failed miserably.My confidence was shattered. I had no idea what happened. It was probably my lack of preparation that ate me up. All of my batch mates also didn't make it but they had backups. Hence they went on. Demoralized, I said no, I cannot give up this easily. I then started to prepare for judicial services(It's like a Administrative service exam just for lawyers). The syllabus for that is bit easy than post graduate colleges. I decided to prepare at home and attempting for post graduation next year. The classes for this year will be online for post graduation. Hence my goal of getting out and making new friends or changing the environment would be defeated.Now here comes the problem. I recruited a friend of mine along with who I study for judicial services. But she is a bit busy with her house chores but regardless she tries her best to keep up. Then there is another with whom I work on physical fitness. Some friends whom I kinda talk to but I hate bothering any one of them. I just hate being seen as needy. So basically, this is way I try to keep myself busy. But recently, people are getting busier, some have there classes starting. Hence I am left all alone in the end. And no doubt that as soon as my graduation completes, I have to work my ass off to keep up with my career. But although I am not bothered much when people don't talk or respond, it does hamper my ability to study efficiently. The thoughts of what they will think or say or anything else just eat me up while studying. I have improved my lifestyle and study routine. But it is not upto the mark.You could say deep down I know that preparing for exams at home is not going as well as expected. The alternative to all this is me just getting inside litigation period. Litigation is a very hard field but as I have a family background, things are going to be a bit easier for me. But seriously saying, thinking about it scares the shit out of me. I just know that life will be very hard there in litigation. I would be treated like shit. Seniors would not even give the light of day for the first few months but still I would probably get out of the house. Now the thing is that I have been given the option to try whatever I want by my parents for 3 years or I could join litigation right now. But somewhere I know that preparation will pay off but at what cost. I am seriously confused as to what I should do?. I have this notion in my mind that if I am able to find a good friend circle, only then I would be able to prepare for judicial services properly for which I want to go in for post graduation. Is this thought process correct? Please help"

She pushed me to move in together which I was not ready for. But eventually I realized her interests and behaviors does not align with my lifestyle. I told her the same but she wanted to work on the relationship and go forward. I did my best to express and get out of it. The friction developed and we decided to part away but we continued to stay in the same apartment. She was really upset and got drunk one night during our dinner. That night we had an argument and she took my phone and started calling my contacts. While I tried to get it back holding her arm, it left a mark on her hand and considering we did this back and forth, she did not feel fine the next morning. I had never experienced this situation before and did my best to help her feel better.At her job, her manager suggested her to take pics and call police. Couple of weeks later she called cops on me at 3 am and she told them everything. I could not believe and the shock left me vulnerable and I did not defend myself when cops asked me for details. I was arrested that night on felony charge. It shattered me and shook my core. I tried my best to get out of the relationship gracefully and  it did not happen. Later, she realized what she has done and tried to take back charges but she is not allowed to.She blackmailed me to move in with her again and continue the relationship else she would not support me with the legal case and I moved in with no heart. I was already in the shock and could not help myself better. Things did not change for the better. After six months we split apart for better. She eventually told that I used her for legal case and she emailed district attorney that I had hurt pretty bad and abused her. She also mentioned I stalked her, destroyed her peace and made her feel worthless. But, my attorney handled it well and my charge was dropped and given an infraction.I continue to suffer with the thoughts and the trauma of the arrest incident. I'm trying to move on but its been very difficult. I keep feeling that I have had massive injustice and loss with all this. Never have I hurt her other than holding her arm that night (my left hand had surgery and was in a splint). Sometimes I feel like dropping an email to the police explaining the details to help myself feel better but this can be a bad idea.I had seen few therapists but did not help me very much."

I\u2019ve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I\u2019ve always faced so much racism. I\u2019ve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I\u2019m just expected to suck it up. I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been told to \u201cgo home\u201d by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I\u2019ll never be seen as a true American. Despite that I just can\u2019t stand it any more. It\u2019s not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That\u2019s the real depressive thing. Anyway, this isn\u2019t to say that all Americans are like this. I\u2019ve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I\u2019m so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I\u2019m ethnically Indian won\u2019t be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I\u2019ll be \u201cthe American\u201d and not \u201cthe Indian.\u201d Systemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don\u2019t exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they\u2019ll grow up in a country where their skin color isn\u2019t their defining factor. I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone with this soapbox. If you\u2019re an American who gets what I\u2019m saying, then thank you, and I am grateful that people like you exist. I acknowledge you and will never lump you in with the other people alluded to."

The rest of my results were As and a two B\u2019s in Spanish and IT. I had extremely high hopes and my parents expected me to go to Cambridge as my dad is a surgeon and my mums a nurse both graduating from top medical schools in India. Just like in high school I slacked during my A levels and planned to pick up the pace and bring it all back. I know that it\u2019s easily in my ability with a few months of hard work I can get the grades a need so I really wasn\u2019t stress. Then corona hit.Exams were cancelled and I had no idea what to think, I was hopeful that my grades will be as they are predicted but I got completely screwed over and downgraded. I ended up with and A in English lit and a C in history and chem when I was predicted A*BBIt\u2019s only my third day of university and I keep switching between content to completely dissatisfied. It\u2019s still a very nice university and I have a plan for the future but I can\u2019t stop thinking about how it would be easier if I went to a more prestigious university as originally planned. I can\u2019t stop thinking about my parents success and how my future will most likely fail to compare. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how people who used to ask me for help in class are going to do to exactly what they wanted. I can\u2019t stop feeling compelled to tell everyone I\u2019m smarter than they think and adversely making myself look like an arrogant dick.The only times I feel happy is when I\u2019m with my girlfriend who at this point is my saving grace who brings me so much joy but when I\u2019m not with her I go back to my state of discontent. I can\u2019t rely on this as a mechanism to enjoy my time here because she is prone to outbursts of emotion as she has bpd so I don\u2019t want to overwhelm in any way which is why I\u2019m complaining on Reddit lol.I really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this but I feel better already. It\u2019s very whiny and self pitying but oh well, thanks for reading and if anyone is in a similar situation please let me know how they are coping."

Does every psychiatrist talk to the patient alone? I'm too scared to let my family know any details about this and am really scared that the doctor will start asking questions in front of my family member. I'm scared the room won't be sound-proof, so anyone outside can hear the conversation. Will all my details be kept completely confidential?2. Do the doctor always prescribe medicines? I'm very uncomfortable taking medicines (have had to take so many medicines for other illness recently). Can it be only therapies or something?Please let know from your experiences. It'll be a lot helpful for me to prepare for the visit. Thank you."

Though, the result will take more than a month to come out I am having anxiety and pablic attacks though the intensity is not strong it still gets a bit ugly. I have been having sleepless nights and I am unable to concentrate on other things.- This is not my dream college but I would very much like to be a part of it as it would be the best alternative to my current situation.-  This year has not been great for me I have lost some close people, I have been dealing with college rejections, I have been involved in some sort of alterations with authorities which have had me shell out some money. I need some help on how to accept the things which might not be fruitful and most importantly I need help to divert my attention somewhere else so that I don't have anxiety and insomnia. Please see -  I don't have many friends or family to whom I can talk to."

I was going to sneak out to get therapy by telling them I was going to a friends house. My parents dont think therapy is a \"real thing\" and its only for rich people they say things like \"mental illness is a rich persons disease\" inspite of  my sister and mom suffering through mental health issues.I've tried apps where you can talk to bots but they dont seem to help at all. I've talked to strangers too. I've tried looking online but I cant find any therapist for free (I live in India). I cant make online payments as I dont have a credit card or any other online payment alternative and I can't use my parents card either. All our money transactions are noted and due to this pandemic we are having financial issues aswell.I've tried talking to a friend about it but it doesnt seem to help either and I feel like a burden.Even if I get online therapy somehow I wont be able to talk to a therapist on calls or videochats. I can only text them as I dont want my family to be able to hear it (noises travel in my house) and frankly they dont have much respect for privacy in the first place.What are some ways that I could get help for free? And with my situation in mind non verbal therapy would be the best where I could communicate only through texts.Please please please offer some help I really, really need it."

Like she is a very good person and we all love her , and yeah sometimes the rest of the family might be introverted so our expression is not a 100% direct but we make is visible. But then she in these minor issues  starts of a chain of thoughts which make her super depressed and change her entire outlook of the world into negative. And this is not a one time thing , she does that every single time some misunderstanding or small problem occurs. Like I try to tell her or make her understand that these minor things need to be looked past and they don't matter , but she clings onto  them. And in a past few days this has gone to bad, she cries at night ( awake) about all the past year issues she had with my father ( all the minor spats she has with him) she becomes inconsolable during these hours. And honestly I don't know if this is a mental health related issue. If I were her in her shoes I might also trip on the these daily problems / misunderstandings we have with other people, but I won't dwell on them for too long, my mom she dwells on these too much.

I got admitted in a good college, but the way he used to speak to me, which unfortunately, I can't remember exactly, only feelings, I stopped studying properly. I failed 3 semesters, out of 4, and only used to go for my exams.I wanted to become a teacher, for 11-12th grades. But he then started to force me to become a teacher once I've cleared my exams. Telling me at least once a week that I should give these exams so I can get a job. Or he'd ask his teacher friends to come and convince me to become a teacher.Now I fucking don't want to do it!

As selfish as it is, I really can't support them or be happy for them right now because of my result and how bad I feel.The anxiety I had before I checked my result has just gotten worse as I try to figure out what to do about my college and stuff now.To make matters worse I can't help but feel like a horrible friend for just disappearing and not responding to their great scores.As if that wasn't enough, one of my friends decided to publicly post our scores on her Instagram, the way everyone does in my grade. But since she didn't know mine she just posted a '?' symbol next to me and that's making my anxiety even worse.I feel as though everyone I know is now wondering what my marks are that my friend had to post a '?' Further, every relative is calling up my parents asking them how I did, comparing my scores to their children's scores.It's too much.I feel horrible acting out because it's not like I flunked or anything but I can't help but feel so disappointed and miserable and anxious about everything.I'm sorry if this sounds stupid, I just needed to vent and since there's really no one for me to talk to in real life, this is where I ended up."

        "title": "Some thoughts. This is what stops me from doing the things I love",
        "selftext": "One of my earliest memories is sometime in the year 2000. I was at a book exhibition at school with my parents, which was sponsored by Scholastic. I remember being happy and excited, even though at that age I barely knew anything about anything. But I did like books, and was fascinated by the dizzying collection of colourful books there.My favourite book as a kid was the Atlas. I loved poring through my copy, and to look at not just maps of India, but of the whole world. This atlas not only had political maps, but geologic and weather maps too. I used to play atlas with my cousin brother where he would name a city from a country and I had to find it. It is unbelievable how much joy I got out from one book. I used to look at the scale at the bottom and marvel at the sheer size of the earth, how 1 centimetre on a map could equal a thousand kilometres.The appeal of geography is for people who find \u2018what is the world like out there?\u2019 an interesting question to pursue. There is another subject that poses the same question: Space &amp; Astronomy. That day in 2000, the only book I asked my parents to buy was one on the solar system. When I flipped through it and saw the pictures, there was no way I was leaving without it.Books were my lifeblood. And I don\u2019t mean novels. I mean the atlas, the book on the solar system, Tinkle comics, and Amar Chitra Katha. For my 11th or 12th birthday my dad bought me a collection of 25 Amar Chitra Kathas. To this day it remains to be the best birthday present I ever got. I was so hooked onto these books that my parents had to lock up my collection during exam time. And I of course sneaked them out and read them to my heart\u2019s content.Another gift I received around that age from my cousin brother, was Trivial Pursuit in the form of a small digital console. Every time I pressed the button for \u2018Next question\u2019, I yearned for the shuffle to land on Science &amp; Technology. Though I fortunately wasn\u2019t aware of the word at the time, but I was a dork, and glad to be one.What I love the most about my childhood was the certainty I had about the things that made me happy, and the determination to pursue them earnestly. Granted, books and games are inherently quite ordinary and not particularly challenging. But no act is small when it is towards something your heart truly enjoys. I never stopped to question whether these things made me a dork/nerd/geek, or whether my friends liked it, or whether my parents liked these things about me. I liked doing these things and that was it \u2014 end of story.It\u2019s 2020 now, and doing what I want has become incredibly hard. And it is not because of work or this pandemic or \u2018a part of growing up\u2019. Consider writing for example. Apart from a couple of long captions on Instagram, I haven\u2019t written a word in the last 6 months. I had time, I had things to say, and I genuinely enjoy writing. It creates a coherence and flow in my thoughts like nothing else and there is a sense of adventure. It\u2019s like you start drawing a fruit, which then becomes a part of a tree, at which point a nest emerges, and you end up drawing a baby bird taking its first flight to grab the fruit.And yet this is how my attempts to write go: The moment an idea enters, my friend\u2019s face pops up, smirking at me and telling me this is no good. I think of how certain people will react, most of whom never read what I post anyway. I picture them narrowing their eyes, flaring their nostrils, and just scrolling past my words mercilessly. I remember a friend calling my writing a ramble, and another one saying I don\u2019t mean the things I write. And thus the idea dies before it even takes shape into words.Rationally, I know I\u2019m not supposed to care.Should I care about what people say? No.Should I care when my friend smirks? No.Do I care anyway? Yes.Singing is something I enjoy too. A few months ago I purchased a condenser mic to record better. But I have been falling into the same trap again. Instead of recording, I hopelessly go through songs and think \u201cwell, this won\u2019t be well received.\u201d \u201cThis one will make people call me gay.\u201d \u201cThis is too niche and nobody will connect to it.\u201d \u201cI sound funny on the high notes so what\u2019s the point recording, fuck it.\u201dI think this is what is known as compulsive behaviour. They\u2019re kind of like these bad habits, that you know are bad, yet you find it impossible to break out of them. When I eat at home, I absolutely must watch something while eating. And 95 percent of the time I will be watching something I\u2019ve already seen. A re-run of Seinfeld, It\u2019s always Sunny in Philadelphia, Arrested Development, the entire MCU movie list: it is just an automatic action, into which no thinking goes whatsoever. Grab plate. Open mac. Open chrome. Enter Hotstar or Primevideo. Click on next episode. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or even fruit: press play.Breaking out of these loops is like going through withdrawal. Last week I was angry at myself for watching The Newsroom for a 4th time, so one day I just didn\u2019t watch anything. It literally felt painful  leaving it mid-season like that even though I knew what was going to happen. The next day, I tried browsing to see whether there\u2019s something that genuinely interests me. I searched for space, and ended up watching an Engineering Marvels episode of the International Space Station. The next day I found the show Cosmos, and it rekindled joy. The joy of rediscovering a lost love, of the mind actually having to work to decipher what was being said, and rewind, if needed. Planet Earth is the only other show to have had this effect on me. It is Cosmos in fact, that sparked the memory of the book exhibition from 20 years ago.There are other more embarrassing instances of compulsive behaviours that angered me. The launch of reels on Instagram meant that whenever I clicked on the search button, I was forced to constantly see what is usually a teen/young adult woman prancing and dancing in a series of costumes. I somehow got hooked to this particular profile, and started obsessively loading it again and again till a new post came. I don\u2019t know this person, and yet dutifully watch her and learn 5 different ways to style a black tee. I had to uninstall Instagram for a few days to come to my senses, then eventually block her.Everyone wants to live their life doing the things they love, and everyone has the time to do it. Looking back, if I think about why I haven\u2019t done (more) of things I like, even the easiest of things, the answer is simple. One, I have spent way, way too much energy on \u2018what would people think?\u2019 and two, I spent my free time on auto-pilot, instead of taking the wheel and driving where I want to.Doing what you love is level 2. Level 1 is to be conscious of what you\u2019re actually doing. Watch and study yourself. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll be surprised at the number of things you do without actually consciously deciding to. Love can wait, I\u2019ll be happy to take the wheel for starters."

(there's a lot of controversy surrounding his demise, and I don't want to get into it. You could look up Sushant Singh Rajput demise on Google if you wish to know) His demise has left me shaken. I was not a mega fan of his work, but I genuinely appreciated his work. It seems he was diagnosed with clinical depression. And I guess all what happened is acting like a trigger for me? I have struggled with anxiety and had medically induced depression about a decade ago where, I used to have suicidal thoughts. I don't anymore, I'm in a much much better place. This year it's just been bad news after bad news, with everything that has been happening around the world. I've been feeling worthless and low for no reason. (I'm a language tutor and I'm doing WFH, and I really enjoy teaching) I had received a scholarship for a course in Germany, and I was really looking forward to go, had gotten all VISA formalities done and dusted, too, but Corona has pooped all over those plans as well, and my dreams got crushed. I have accepted that now, and am much better, but I keep having these bouts of low mood. I try my best to cheer myself up, I watch something funny, I listen to music, I play with my Dog, and I'm fine, till the next time. I'm not like this, I don't like feeling weak and vulnerable. And I hate it when I do. I don't even know what I have typed."

        "selftext": "Hey reddit.I'm a 19 year old in India. Although I am technically undiagnosed, I have suffered a lot of trauma in the past. My dad is an alcoholic who abuses my mum a lot when he's drunk. She's not perfect but has done nothing to deserve this abuse. The words he calls her are quite hard to listen to. He has called me a lot of shit in the past as well, and we have had bouts once or twice.Whenever he has an episode, I am deeply impacted by what's happened but as soon as his episode is over, I am somewhat normal again. I do not know if I was dealing with the trauma or just suppressing it. All this has made me contemplate suicide in the past (a couple of times) but have never truly acted on it because I want to get her out of this mess.None of the people I know are on reddit so that is why I am able to post this here. I do not know what to do. It's getting harder to deal with each time this hapens. I have had breakdowns as well.He drinks everyday and is a bit abusive but every 2 months or so, he goes all out. Drinking for weeks straight. All day. We have tried stopping him, getting him in rehab, attending AA meetings as well.My mum cannot get a divorce or have a separation because of societal constraints. Also, our family business is also partially dependent on him. I have enrolled in courses which statistically lead to high paying jobs so that I can get out of this. But every single exam of mine has an episode just before this. I need to study at least 10 hrs a day but am unable to do so rn.The last time he came back from rehab, I told him that I couldn't live like this and told him I was feeling suicidal because of him. He told me he couldn't stop drinking, alcoholism is a disease and that I should support him. I have tried my best but I can't do this any longer. I can't live like this. Please tell me-what do I do?? I have lost my faith in God as well, have tried everything, words like \"it will get easier\" / \"everything will be alright\" seem fake and false reassurance. Rehab doesn't work, I cannot escape this. I can't even go out for a drive without risking my life."

        "selftext": "Hi. I (27M) have learnt through self observation that i am what they call a 'vulnerable narcissist', The more i read about this the more accept this condition within me. I am emotionally weak and ill disciplined person, who has shown a lack of control when expressing anger, dissapointment or mere show of love. I have always overdone things, i have done things which i have regretted alot later, a tad on the dramatic side (knowing quite well while i behaved that way that i am over doing this to get a certain kinda response that i am expecting from the other person) i have blamed my anger on others provocation (sometimes true). So now, what i have realised is that i am always anxious, always wanting appreciation and never taking rejection or criticism well. Almost everytime i am criticized at work i have come an inch close to quitting. If i predicted rejection to an action i never went ahead with doing that thing. This has led me to be a very calculative person who worries everytime i say Hi because i am bothered it wont be said back. It takes a long time for me to get comfortable in an environment among new people, and even then years later i spend most of my time putting every response and reaction towards me under the microscope. I do want to change, i want a healthy mental state, a confident personality not determined by other persons actions. I have spent most of my life trying to please others and then trying to control their reactions towards me by doing so. Shutting off to every criticism, thriving when around constant appreciation. I had a wierd childhood, kinda abusive but at that time almost every kid got a good beating from their parents (not cool but yet normal in India i guess) I love parents, they have done a lot for me and i could die for them. but then when i look back i keep questioning if that is the reason i was like this, to get beaten when behaving in a certain way, when getting bad grades, etc. Or was it my college days when my elder brother (who paid for most of my college and cars and what not) used to put me down in front of people, friends and claim how much i lacked i life. Or is it just me finding such reasons to blame things on. In recent days, i spend most of my time thinking about all these things. I have also recently had a break up (toxic controlling partner). But what is happening now is that i fee its me who is at fault for everything probably, because the way i am, and the way i behave, and the way i try to please people and burst when things dont go my way. I work in waves now, certain part of the day is way too good (specially when i have my black coffee) and certain times are too low, this is when i dont wanna do anything. I know i have a lot of potential, i was always bright, i was praised in my gradute college and mba college (probably why i was bright and happy, the appreciation) i feel i am not living upto the life i should have had by now. I earn less than the same people who used to praise me, i struggle more than the people i felt i was better than. I have made bad choices with career, relationships, and everything else. I know 27 is not too late. I need to move ahead in life, but things need to change. And idk how to do that. Any suggestions are appreciated."

        "selftext": "*this might not make sense to most people*I feel like these three words can define my whole life. For as long as I can remember I've had trouble making decisions. When I was in my teens I was having problems in making decisions, important decisions like picking a major or what I want to study as well as easy ones like where do I wanna eat lunch. But back then I didn't think much of it. As I grew up, right after high school is when major changes started to happen in my life. I couldn't decide on what to pick for my college education. There were times every option seemed doable and there were times when nothing seemed favourable. So for most part in my life I do things which are most commonly followed by people, thinking that is probably the safest bet as majority of people do it. So I got into engineering, like most Indian kids. I simply did it because I didn't know what else to do. I was miserable the whole while I was there. My grades sucked, I had no friends, only two people I talked to because we went to college together. I didn't like anyone. For 4 years of my college I spend my day sitting in class waiting for it to end. zoned out. Absolutely blank. I didn't even leave class during lunch breaks. I have been living in the same house with my mom my whole life (Im 23now). My father used to work UAE for 10 year from when I was in 6th standard to when I finished my graduation. I cannot remember much of my childhood days. The only thing I remember is my mom and dad fighting and shouting. Everything is a blurr. So much that, I can almost remember an incident when my dad was trying to hit my mom with a belt and I held onto it to stop him. Now I don't know if it was real or I'm just making it up in my head. Now I'm 23, graduated last year with shitty grades, and I'm at my first job for the last 9 months which I couldn't give less fucks about. I got this job simply because I didn't know what else to do and came across an ad. It doesn't pay much, I'm mostly sitting in front of the laptop. But it pays the bills. Now days the indecisiveness has become much more prominent. It's like a constant battle in my head about what I should do. Should I do this, should I do that, what if I had done this, what if it was the other way around. I just don't know. All I want is to be dead. I have been wishing for death for the last 4 years. Not that i have made any attempts to take my life. I have just been hoping to die. In any manner no matter how painful. Just for this miserable life to end. I think the only reason I have not killed my self or tried to so far, is because I have to support my family now. My father is retired. And me and my sister are working. I am 4 years younger. I feel so helpless that I don't even have the option to end my own life because others depend it. Which somehow seems worse than being dead. When you're dead, you're just dead. It's those around you who have to get through this pain. But when you want to die and you know that it's not an option. You have to suffer every single day. Pretending to be normal. I have been considering going to therapy for the past two months, because it's not a common thing around here to seek therapy. If you're from India, I think you can relate. Growing up I didn't even know there's a thing called therapy. There's hardly anyone talking about going to therapy. But the thing is... I don't know!I don't know if what I am going through is actually some mental health issue or I am just being overanalytical or exaggerating things. I don't know if it's depression, dysthymia, aboulomania. I don't know if going to a therapist would be the best thing. Since the lockdown I have been looking this stuff up on Google and that's where I came across the term. Aboulomania. Idk if what I am going through classifies as that. And I don't want to call myself depressed because I know there are people going to much much worse. IS THIS WORTH GOING TO THERAPY?All I know is, I tell myself that 'i wish I was dead' about 10 times a day. I have been feeling this way for the past 4-5years. I know that I am scared of everything. I don't know if I wanna get better. And I don't know why I am even writing this. If you have actually read this far, I thank you for your patience, and if there's someone out there who feels same please hmu."

This is a sight to cause goose-bumps for the most anti-social introvert as well. Such is the situation for almost all of us during these trying times of COVID-19 lockdowns.All of us have been trying extremely hard to cope up with the sudden surge of extra time that seems to be hanging over us. Be it cooking, crafts, an entire day of Netflix, we have reached a point where there are no more recipes to make, nothing exciting to watch, AND\u2026 lo and behold. Here come the unavoidable introspection and self-assessment. With this introspection comes forth anxiety and inferiority from what someone said to you many moons ago and all your failed relationships. Those who are already suffering from some mental disorder are experiencing hikes in the symptoms. The untimely and unfortunate death of the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput can\u2019t be ignored here.\u00a0However, in India, mental health is still not given priority. Many times we overlook the symptoms; we shift blames. We are a culture of comparing pains. We have all had conversations with our parents with something along the lines of \u201cmujhe yeh pareshaani hai\u201d and received replies like \u201cToh kya hua, yeh sab bas tumhari soch hai\u201d. Our parents and grandparents tend to run away from mental pains and discomforts and preach to bottle everything up. It is not their fault; they grew up seeing the same and are adamant about not changing their views.People often forget that just like a person suffering from an injury or some disorder has happy and normal moments; just like that a person suffering from depression also has some good days. Depression manifests itself differently in different individuals.Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone has spoken vividly about her battle with clinical depression and has founded the \u201cLive Love Laugh\u201d foundation to provide help and raise awareness regarding depression. She says,\u00a0\u201cPeople talk about physical fitness, but mental health is equally important. I see people suffering, and their families feel a sense of shame about it, which doesn\u2019t help. One needs support and understanding. I am now working on an initiative to create awareness about anxiety and depression and help people.\u201d           Readmore-https://shouts.site/mental-health-during-covid-19/"

Context : I was travelling solo, it was late at night in India. I quickly kept my gps on, booked the nearest hotel room and when I reached the hotel, asked him to stop, lying that I needed to buy something. At this point only my adrenaline was running. Once I got out of the car, I got my bag and he tried stopping me. Then I had it. I ended up shouting and kicking him in his balls. And then I called the cops. The Indian cops let him go cause he had some political influence and dragged me by my hair to the hospital, I still have scratch marks of a lady police officer. At the hospital I was in the trauma ward.I had bruises on my feet and hands. Nobody took my statement. I flew back home and went to a psychiatrist who I told that I smoked weed on my vacation after a gap of 6 months along with everything I just told you right now. She asked me if I want to go to a calm place where I can relax and I said yes. I ended up going to a rehab. I was carrying my guitar, notebook, a pencil box and some water colors. I genuinely thought I was going to a place to relax. The first hour there they took everything away. I was put in a blue dress and when I asked a man(who is the director of the place) about my art supplies, he said, \"this isn't your dad's hotel\". It was basically a jail. No colors. No books. No music. No art. They didnt even let me sing. I wasnt allowed to take showers keeping the door closed so basically I had no privacy. I used to stay silent and cry and was locked up in a floor with other women. I wasnt even allowed to open the windows to let any air in. I stayed there for 9 days. Two other inmates told me their story - a 20 year old girl dragged publicly by her hair to here cause she smokes weed and a pregnant mother losing her calm cause her husband cheated on her. He sent her there. Eventually I left the place and was diagnosed with BPD. After a month, I went to a different country where I went to a different therapist. She listened to me for a change. She listened. THAT changed my life. She actually active listened. After 1 month of therapy, she said I had no signs of bpd and actually had complex PTSD. Last december I stopped any medication and I am okay now. It's just sometimes it hurts so much to look back. I keep looking for other people who went through something similar but cannot find any. If you are reading this, which I highly doubt anybody is, thank you. Please share a thought of yours."

Like even about where is the right source that i can find help from?I need to know in general in India and outside as well what the rules are regarding institutionlaising some one into a rehab/ mental health institue/ asylum what ever it is that they are called against their consent.Bc my family in the past has insitutionaliesd me 2 times before against my consent. Im a 34 yr old adult. And my family is basically just using it as an excuse to bully me with it for no reason. I dont quite understand their motive behind it. Firstly.It was basically my mother who first started with this labeling. But she actually had a personl motive for doing it. Which became clear to me eventually though not at the time when she first started labeling me as mentally ill.Turns out that she was looking for an excues to seperate from my father and me and she used the lable of me and my fathers side of the faimly being mentally unfit so that that she could walk out of the marriage for social status reasons.But the thing is that after she left. And i was left back with my fathers family i though i would have no more reason to worry about this label anymore. Bc it has served its purpose now that  my mother has gotten what she wanted out of it.But unfortunately. My whole family.Not just my mothers side. Who we do not even keep in touch with anymore.But even my fathers side. That i currently am residing with still do not quit it with calling me the lable of being mentally ill.And most of all up untill then when my mother was still together with my father. I was only being forced to get counceling and therapy for whatever mumbo jumbo that they could find and cook up against me.But this is aftet my mother even left my father. Both sides of my family even began to instiutonalise me at this point.And now the thing is that i know now why my mother wanted to do this.But i still Do Not understand why the rest of my family is still going on doing it?I don't understand what their underlying agenda and motive behind this is?But recently/currently i am going through some stuff and i think my father talked to the Dr. that i am seeing and asked him about institutionlising me this time again.But the doctor declined it by telling him that recently there have been some reforms in the laws against instiutionlisng anyone without their consent. And it is no longer legal to do it anymore.So even though i am happy that what ever this rule is it is working in my favour. But i was still hoping that i could find out more clearly about it instead of just blindly beliveing my father.But i dont really know where to find out about it?I just in general feel really lost about everything that keeps happening around me. Bc of the sick games that keep getting played on me by my family.It would just give some mental ease to know what the deal with this \"air qoute\" NEW REFORM IN THE LAW AGAINST SENDING SOMEONE TO REHAB AGAINST THEIR WILL is all about???"

        "selftext": "I'm a 17 year old guy who has played football(soccer) since I was 8. I've always done fine in school and have a really good social life. I've been the best at the sport in my area and was the top scorer for the most competitive league in my country India (Hero Youth League). I've also always played video games and have been addicted to Rust, DayZ and CSGO since I was 14. Due to my genetics I have been able to peak my fitness and football skill while playing videogames all day.However this all ended in 10th grade when I started facing problems with my ankle and getting injuries everytime I shot the ball. I got an MRI and got diagnosed with numerous injuries(impingement, bone marrow edema, synovial thickening) bone marrow edema being the worst out of them. This injury wasnt enough to prevent me from playing but caused me a lot of constant pain and prevented me from being able to shoot the ball at a certain angle with a lot of power. I also have had constant ankle pain for the last 3 years. Finally this year due to quarantine i was able to rest my ankle for 5 months. My parents took away all my videogames which were my primary source of happiness after football so I have had nothing to do but study and wait for my ankle to heal. Last week I finally decided to play a 5v5 match against some college guys and got the most horrible swelling after playing for 10 minutes resulting in me not being able to walk and I still have the swelling preventing me from being able to walk for the last week. My dream has always been to become a professional footballer and this year was my last chance to fulfill it but this injury seems to have not changed in the 5 months of healing as it feels worse than before i started the rest. I just dont see any point in living anymore as the only thing I really want to do with my life is being taken away from me because of this injury. I feel like a cripple and cant see myself getting an office job in the future just giving all of this up. The only thing that brings me joy in life is football and I've basically become a cripple as any physical exercise results in my ankle swelling up to the  point that I cannot walk. The only thing I have to do now is study all day and attend online classes but its not what I feel I was born to do. I have 0 happiness nowadays and don't see any point in living anymore. I am completely aware that there are people who have much much worse circumstances than me and I seem like a baby complaining about this but I don't feel like I have a reason to live anymore. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is how I know that it will deeply hurt my family and friends and could result in them blaming themselves for it when it was really just me who was the cause for it. I feel slowly and slowly neglecting that consequence and I feel eventually I'm just going to end it because I dont have any real purpose in life anymore."

        "selftext": "School life, or early college life for that matter, is not as simple as many would have you believe. From group dynamics to image maintenance to early tryst with relationships, there are a ton of factors that they have to navigate through, pretty much on their own. With the popularity of social media and easy access to smartphones for today\u2019s teens, the issues have magnified. Hence, the importance of a [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) in today\u2019s society has increased a lot. Even today, the idea of therapy for young adults seems like an alien concept for many. In a world where even adults have to either hide that they are going for therapy or dismiss the concept altogether, this should not come as a shocker. But, circling back to teens and why teens need therapy, the fact of the matter is that in today\u2019s world, there are so many issues that teens face but are not always emotionally equipped to handle them well. Add to that, some teens are not very close to their parents, so they turn to their friends for advice and that is never a good decision. So, what are these issues that teens face? Let us discuss a few.**1.** **Substance abuse: -** More often than not, some sort of abuse is at the centre of all the issues. With urban teens having access to the internet so readily, it also makes accessing illegal substances extremely easy. Sometimes, a teen is the initiator while others follow suit because of peer pressure. Results of substance abuse are no longer a secret, and everyone knows what can happen to a person. It is extremely important to recognise signs of substance abuse and address them right away. If you are looking for a [therapist for teens in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/), you should not have any issues finding one. The city has some of the best therapists in India. It is important to maintain dialogue with a teen. Talk to them, ask them about their issues and make them feel safe. A hostile environment at home is the breeding ground of early life issues that can further lead to substance abuse. **2.** **Stress -** Yes, stress is an extremely broad factor, but it is also an extremely important one. As adults, with experience, we get used to the stress. We find ways to dissipate it or manage it. But teens, like we have mentioned above, are not emotionally equipped to handle stress very well. Now, stress can be cause by many factors, like studies, peer pressure, social media anxiety and more. It is important to continue having a conversation with them. As we have mentioned, if you are on the lookout for a [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) has some of the best ones in India. It is never too late to seek help and above all, it is not a reason to feel shameful. But the only way you will know that you, teen needs therapy is if you just talk to them."

It's rare that I'm not being constantly shouted at even though I'm working hard AND getting results.. I'll keep it short.Situation in college:1. Teachers have not taken any classes or made any efforts to progress the syllabus since the lockdown. I'm an electronics and communication engineer.2. We have almost no notes and our teachers don't know basic maths and are unable to teach the subject.3. The exams have been kept at a week and a half's notice. Even though they're mid sems, they're one after the other, hence it consists of 70% of the syllabus in this semester, of which 80+% hasn't been covered.4. We've written countless assignments, and a lot of tests. None of them are being considered for our marks and we don't know how we're being graded.I've been having panic attacks. Today a teacher took a verilog (coding) exam, and the question which came to me and a few others was not in the syllabus, and I'm sure the teacher doesn't know how to solve that, or most other questions.We cannot cheat in the exams as we lack notes and knowledge of the subjects, and on top of that, we've been asked to keep our webcam turned on and audio turned on, sitting 6ft in front of the camera.I used to be a person with routine. Sleep by 11 pm, wake up at 5 am, study at specific times, meals on specific times and exercise every evening.As of now, I'm suffering from migraines, I don't remember when I slept last, and have been studying all day (almost). I'm forgetting to have food (and things at home are bad enough that no one reminds me usually). I pass out while studying because I realise I've not eaten 2-3 consecutive meals.I'm still pushing but I don't know what to do."

We are part of a bigger friend group, but us, along with another male friend grew close in our teenage years. It wasn't like we were best friends, but we were close friends who met up at least every week when every one was in town and I felt we could talk to about anything. However, over the last year, we've grown super close and communicate weekly. Okay I guess that's enough information for you guys to understand our relationship. She started college three years ago and she made a couple of friends. However, she soon learnt that they were very toxic. This was also around the time when her sister, who she's extremely close to, moved to another country. I don't know exactly when she started feel a bit lonely, but in September last year all three of us had met up for a sleepover and she said that she felt depressed. Her boyfriend at the time had also ghosted her and started telling people that they had broken up without even telling her about it. The other guy was going to therapy for his own reasons, which I won't mention for his privacy, and he immediately told her to try it. We talked a while about it and gave her options such as seeing if her college had a therapist or her talking to her parents and getting her help.She told us that she had talked to her parents and they brushed it off by saying \"you are strong\" and \"it's just a phase\". After this, she didn't want to talk to her parents about it. I started to check on her weekly until she told me that she felt fine and doesn't need any help. So, I stopped specifically asking \"How are you feeling\" and would straight go to things like \"You'll never guess what happened today\" and just talk like normal friends would. Last week was her birthday and we had a long conversation where she told me that she had a great day even with the virus and I was happy to see that her mental state had improved a lot. Well, today I received the following message&lt;My name&gt; I thought I am okay and that I don't need any therapy but maybe I do! I have mini panic attacks a lot idk I can't talk to anyone about how I feel even if I want to. I dont let myself speak so idk what to doThe main issue I have is that I want to say that you can talk to me and you can try to go for therapy but she specifically says that she doesn't let herself speak. Also, she sent me this message at 4 in the morning, so I wonder if she had a panic attack then or had thoughts about self-harming. Please tell me what should I do.Edit: we live in India, just read the rule about geographic location."

It's not that they act spiteful or do anything to hurt me, but I simply feel an overwhelming sense of digust and pent up anger towards both. I smash things, unable to scream and the aura is all of. As if their presence is killing me. My sister arrived today. After spending on an extravagant meal, I am curled under my blanket with a migraine. I don't understand why I despise and hate her to a point where I just want to punch her face into a fucking wall.(Prelude: I live in India where family sticks on all along and there is no concept of separation even if you have spent a decade away from home. I buy my mother and sister nice things, clothes and spend time on phone, but it is their physical presence that angers me. I even screamed at my dad at the top of my lungs for sending my sister to my place for the weekend.)My hate is feeling physical. I hate everything about this.

        "title": "Different Therapy Techniques That Work For Depressed People",
        "selftext": "Therapy is no longer a buzz word used by the urban elite of our country. Thanks to a lot more acceptance of mental health around our country, therapy has become relatively more accessible for people. By no means is it absolutely fine, but it is a step in the right direction. People who suffer from mental health problems like depression have more access to therapy, especially in the major cities of India and that is something we could not have said a few years ago. Nowadays, people have access to [support groups](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), top notch therapists and psychiatrists. This means that people, even if they aren\u2019t comfortable talking about therapy with their family or friends, still have a way to deal with their mental health issues. So, how does therapy help people get over their fears, issues and everything pertaining to their mental health? Let\u2019s have a look at some of the most commonly used and effective techniques of therapy. 1) **Group psychotherapy -** Group psychotherapy is a form of therapy in which one, or multiple therapists treat a small group of people. [Group therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) is extensively available at private hospitals, clinics of psychologists and therapeutic centers. Studies show that group psychotherapy is effective for people with depression. One of the main reason people seek group psychotherapy is that it allows them to receive support and affection from people going through similar issues. Moreover, fellow group members also serve as highly accessible role models. Their dedication to the cause and progress can work as a great reinforcement for others in the group. 2) **Narrative therapy -** Another highly effective form of therapy is narrative therapy. In this form of therapy, the psychologist separates the person from the problem. In a nutshell, it is all about encouraging the person to use their personal skills to come up with solutions for their problems. What this does is that it helps people objectify their problems. It also allows the person to create wriggle room for other stories in their lives. So many times, when you are going through something larger than you, you invariably work around that problem. What that does is that it consumes everything in your life. Similar to [group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), where you see other people\u2019s issues to add more perspective to your problems, narrative therapy helps you look at your problems in a bit more impersonal way. That allows you to add more positive stories in your life, which ends preloving that stress a little bit. Narrative therapy is not about transforming someone. It is about transforming the effects of a problem. The aim for narrative therapy is to add space between a problem and the person. This allows the person to see how a certain concern is serving them, rather than it just harming them. This kind of therapy also helps put certain problems in different contexts. These contexts can be personal, social, political and cultural. What this does is that helps people see how they see themselves and their personal stories."

I\u2019m interested in studying human psychology but I\u2019m not yet sure about the other subjects. I want to become a chef( I know seems hypocritical considering I\u2019ve been through anorexia but that\u2019s where my head works). But my parents to think I\u2019ll need a real job and that cooking could only be practised as a profession. I\u2019ve no idea what stream to take and the time to take the decision is coming near. My parents are quite convinced that I\u2019ll take science and I don\u2019t know how to tell them I want to take humanities when I\u2019m not sure as well. Whenever I try to focus my mind and try to come up with a decision; well I can\u2019t just think about it, my mind always gets diverted, it just won\u2019t allow me to think about it. I\u2019m lost as of to what to do?TLDR- No direction in life. Not sure what stream to take. Cannot focus on the issue and come up with a decision"

She also has periods where she thinks she\u2019s a billionaire and is spending money like it too (tipped a server $100 yesterday.) she\u2019s crashing with me for the time being, but can\u2019t stay here forever (i have housemates).

I haven't felt like myself for the past 10 years. I know I need help but am too scared to go to a doctor due to my last experience. Last time I went, the doctor gave me some medicines which made it worse. I never used to self harm but a month into taking the pills, i started cutting and I feel it will get even worse with the pills. My main fear is of my career but to succeed I need to make an effort which feels too exhausting, so it's like a catch 22 situation. It's. 2 am here right now and I'm still awake, crying. The only person who knows about this is by SO, who is out of town right now so I can't even talk it out with me. I don't know what's wrong with me and what should I do. I want to go to a doctor again but I'm scared it'll be like last time. What things should I research about the doctor before going to them? Also, is there anything I can do at home that can help till I can find a shrink I can trust? Any help would be greatly valued as I'm really at my wit's end.PS: sorry if I haven't explained myself properly. English isn't my first language and I'm crying as I am trying this.Edit: I'm from India (currently in New Delhi) so if anyone knows a good affordable doctor, I'd really appreciate the help. I am not financially well off so that really limits my options as I cannot afford most good doctors here.Edit 2: i used to be a chain smoker, smoking a pack a day but now I've switched to weed since it's free as it grows in the wild in my hometown im uttarakhand and is less harmful than cigarettes. I've quit cigarettes because of it and it does help relaxing me a bit but I don't want to be dependent on it so only smoke up to calm down when I feel like cutting (a couple of times a month). Due to it the self harming has stopped since the last two months but not much else has changed."

I guess some of y'all might've experienced it in your life.&amp;#x200B; So, I come from an average middle class family from India. I graduated high school in 2017 and started with college in Aug 2017. 2 years into it, and I had to drop out in mid-2019 due to failing in a few subjects. It was a very hard situation for the whole family. But still, I got enrolled into another college and I'm pursuing another course currently which I'm confident about and love studying.But now this year, all of my friends from my previous college will be graduating. Some of my other friends have already graduated and started working.This is where my worry and trauma clicks in. In all this process, my parents have been immensely supportive to me but when I see how much financial problem I've created for my family, I feel guilty. I am ready to earn and learn and when I told about this to my parents, they strictly opposed it saying that for now, I should only focus on studies. What they say is right too but this guilt of not being able to do anything for my family eats me up inside everyday, every night.  My parents never compared me with any other child but when people ask about my current situation, they have to answer it and they flinch in talking about it.   In recent times, I've even stopped using any social media because I'm not happy about it. I've stopped attending parties and get-together because the questions of the people make me restless and speaking lie/ avoiding every time just doesn't help.  I know that me graduating and working is the only way to stop all this but still..  My daily routine has become like-1. Wake up, fight life and study hard to get through. Avoid people, Avoid friends.2. Crib and cry myself to sleep, cursing myself.  Let me know your suggestions on this"

I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts. I\u2019m not fully recovered but on the way. Before any of this I didn\u2019t really think of mental health much. Didn\u2019t know much about it. But after going through these things, I\u2019ve really developed a sort of respect for the people who battle these thoughts everyday. Mental health is not really paid much attention in India. We don\u2019t have really good therapists. My question is what can I do to help other people with mental illness and raise awareness about it? Any help would be appreciated"

        "selftext": "  Hello! I'm Aidamis, currently a student abroad, several months after a good Samaritan convinced me to get over my fears and follow through on this project I had started myself.edit: feel to scroll down to the \"therefore\" actual checklist paragraph if the wall of text intimidates you :) thanksHowever, my trip is having the same effect as Steve Jobs' trip to India. Lot of new experiences but no \"Woaouh\" factor, no magical \"falling in love with xyz\", no sudden inspiration surge to fix my nonexistent work ethic, find my passion, or face my demons.I have discovered self-help three and a half years ago after a lightbulb lit up and I faced my wrong university choices, poor life hygiene and low self-respect (like Jordan Peterson I'm a bit wary of the idea of self-esteem). However, after somehow defeating my own dictator who keeps coming back once in a while, I'm still wandering through the desert and still have no clue on how my life relates to my future or any contribution to society worth a damn (pardon my language).Quora recommended \"medication and meditation\" to folks with symptoms similar to mine, and I'm taking neither since I think I'm deeply depressed, just apathetic, zen in a bad way. Meanwhile I put off meditation because (I think that) I'm aware enough that 99% of my problems are still stuck at the wall of accepting mortality, normality and ultimate lack of control. I still cannot let myself go.All in all, that leaves me with one mess of a privilege life I'm ungrateful for, all because while being lazy I'm also a perfectionist with unattainable standards and I stubbornly hold the belief that I have a moral obligation to save the world, or at least contribute to the betterment of the lives of many. Actions-wise this is why I still haven't abandoned creative writing completely, though I've yet to be published. But here too I can't get sh done because while I'm imagining my characters completing their arcs and finding solace I (think I have) no desire for solace myself, maybe because complaining is so much easier.Still, as the song \"to say goodbye\" by Uma2rman goes: \"a late epiphany is wandering my barren room\". I know I have the tools somewhere but I know I don't want to feel pain.So, I've compiled this random list of stuff I need to fix/actions that might be helpful which I am writing in real time, from the top of my head. Problem is, to me getting homework done and playing a videogame is one and the same thing, and love and even self-love is worth pursuing as much as a billion dollar, which is not much. Finally, I have trouble quantifying my goals and breaking them down. I might be in need of some cognitive therapy but where I live the cost is prohibitive and I'd rather take some advice on which books to read to \"self-medicate\".&amp;#x200B;Therefore, what I might be in need of but don't know what to prioritize/how much time-wise is:\\-become even more mindful\\-set a schedule\\-find time for my hobbies and my foreign language studies\\-find time to check on universities for my MD (I graduate this year)\\-get some progress insofar as to finding my life purpose\\-go to the gym/exercise\\-get rid of some annoying addictions, the least of which are YouTube, daydreaming and videogames\\-procrastinate less\\-learn to reward myself without becoming a dog (I heard from a self-help specialist that traditional carrot and stick schemes are outdated and stupid)\\-become self-grounded at long last, whatever that means\\-find true happiness edit - pick up meditation and stick to 20 min/day? if not 20 how much?Please, if you could give some tips on which things to do first, I will be very grateful. &amp;#x200B;Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post and think of an answer. I hope you all have a good day!"

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 31 (m), have a decent amount of nice friends, a cool job and - until recently - a good girlfriend (more on that later). Despite this, more and more I feel like I enjoy nothing. I look forward to nothing. I\u2019m not particularly sad that I\u2019m aware of but everything feels like a chore and I have no enthusiasm for pretty much anything. This has been a growing issue over the past couple of years. I used to be very energetic and would actively instigate activities with friends. I was always the one who would take the lead when arranging trips or nights out. I was always down for doing something and I thrived off being around people my age have long conversations about anything.That started changing around the time I edged towards 30. My ex girlfriend of four years would always joke that I have \u201cno whimsy\u201d or \u201cno joy\u201d because I would become bored or annoyed when she would want to do something fun or kind of \u201cchildish\u201d. She\u2019s a few years younger and a big extrovert party girl type. Which I always liked. When we met I was totally in an all-singing, all-dancing social butterfly period of my life. And I feel like, as time went on and I started to become more and more withdrawn and anxious around people, she started to feel like I\u2019d falsely advertised the type of man I was. She wasn\u2019t a dick about it or anything. We argued here and there but she was mostly cool with me being more of a hermit.I\u2019m really into movies and tv and I\u2019d managed to get a job making wildlife documentaries all over the world. It\u2019s a great gig where I work with people I really like and get to experience stuff that most people don\u2019t get to but I\u2019ve stopped finding it exciting and my productivity has become pretty poor. I still get my work done and manage to coast by on minimum effort but I feel like a huge asshole for not being more grateful and driven. I used to be so much hungrier. Recently I was in India shooting in the jungle and I was surrounded by ruins and temples like something out of an Indiana Jones film and it occurred to me that I should be excited and happy to be doing this. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got rich guy ennui.  I grew up really poor and literally dreamed about this kind of stuff my whole life and here I am and I feel absolutely nothing. Nothing makes me feel excited any more. Me and my girlfriend kind of fizzled out and now I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s got even worse. I can\u2019t even finish a movie any more. I used to watch movies everyday and talk about them for hours. My attention span and passion just seem to have eroded to nothing and I\u2019m just really really worried that this is how life is gonna be from now on."

        "title": "Having anxiety about sissy identity.. Not fully comfortable with it.. Thinking of leaving it.. Pls advice and give some support",
        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I want to share with all of you what I am going through. So, basically, I am a straight male from India. India, as you all may be knowing, is a very religious country filled with ancient cultures,customs and traditions. Here, people watch porn always in hiding bcoz parents would never allow them to do so... Consensual sex between two willing adults is looked upon as bad... Without marriage, u cant have sex. N there r many rigid social dogmas and taboos. I, like any other straight guy, started out with regular porn... I enjoyed it well for a good time but after some i don't know months or maybe a year I found myself watching and enjoying sissy hypnos.. I discovered sissy hypnos just like most straight men who now also identify as sissies might have discovered it, at first watching straight porn for a long time n then after some time straight porn becomes so usual that one doesn't get the libido that one used to get it when one had newly started watching it.... So the lack of libido from straight porn got fulfilled by gender transformation story videos on pornhub and all that finally gave way to sissy hypnos.. I used to casually fap to sissy hypno vids and enjoyed myself, these vids became more enjoyable to me than straight porn... One day suddenly I got intensely hard by the thought of a big black stud fucking me and dominating me...  It was the first time I actually got hard for cock.. Earlier it was just from the thought of being a beautiful submissive slut to men, earlier it was all about being a women but now it was for cock... I fapped and came to the thought of BBC I think twice in one day.. I was feeling horny for it again and again.. Then I got afraid and stopped masturbating to it and after a while the 'getting horny again and again' thing stopped ... From this experience, I realized that I have some degree of desire for big cocks and cum.. Then u know at times I would decide to give up fapping to sissy hypnos and I used to give it up also but after some time I always used to come back... And then after a good phase of this giving it up and then coming back to it again I finally incorporated this sissy fetish in my life by making a rule to masturbate to sissy hypno once every month so as to enjoy it and also not let it affect my mental health in any way(once in a month limit is for ensuring safety of my mental health).... I am currently doing graduation, I have my studies, I live in hostel as college is out of town... So its v imp for me to remain clean(not fap too much, especially not to sissy hypnos) so I can have full focus on what's important... So things were going on like this, I was living a balanced life... Recently I came home on holidays ,and during the holidays I started spending a lot of time redditing, I joined the r/sissyhypno community and made some sissy friends... I started chatting with one of em and suddenly out of excitement started having sissy-to-sissy dirty talks with her(she was a transwoman) and this experience opened myself up completely to my sissy side.. I openly started identifying as a member of the sissy group (I mean not in front of my family, I just mentally became more open to my sissy side and started having girly talks and sharing wild sissy sexual fantasies online with other sissies)... I transitioned from identifying myself as a curious straight male to identifying myself as a sissy... In excitement I took things next level , I installed kik and invited sissies and daddies to chat... At that time I had no idea what would I have to do over there... I thought there wud be just some fun dirty talking and sexting... But when I started chatting with a daddy, he asked me to show him my clit... A terrifying feeling struck me.. I had never ever even just photographed my dick, the thought of sending it to someone was very far away.... But I somehow took a photo in and sent it... Then he asked me to stroke my clitty and cum for him and show all this to him in a video chat... Again I was terrified... It was v hard for me to do such a stuff.. Somehow I went to the bathroom , put him on vid chat and showed myself stroking and cumming for him... He then asked me to lick it up.. But that was impossible.. I said sorry I won't b able to do it... He was ok and said I did a good job but if I wanted to be a sissy, I have to lick cum.. I was feeling terrible and very bad and guilty for what I had just done... Being a member of a respectable family in my society, being a son of my mother who cares for me so much, being a big brother to my dear cousins, I shouldn't have done such base things. Contacted a friend from college, told him everything, and as per his instructions blocked that dom guy, uninstalled kik, left all sissy communities and was also going to delete reddit account.. I was going to go back to identifying myself as a straight male only when suddenly after sometime, the experience with the dom, the moment he was asking to lick cum flashed in my mind and I became hard at the thought of that moment and the imagination of licking it from the floor... I suddenly began feeling positive about my experience with the dom guy and within no moment, I was back on the sissy path... Reinstalled Kik, unblocked the dom guy and explained to him how I was feeling so bad about what happened and how I now feel so positive about it... He understood but gave me an order to punish myself by recording hitting my clitty 10 times.. Again I was a bit terrified bcoz u know each time he orders me, I will have to hide and do it and it is very difficult here in the society I live in. I did the clitty hitting task somehow then explained I could no more serve him bcoz my life is different from other sissies and finally did away with him. I declared my kik open only to sissies. This incident with the dom guy happened yesterday night. So I would say that the experience was very positive for me, it removed many of my earlier hesitations. Now I can confidently send pics of parts of my body and I have no guilt in doing these things.  But yes I am still a bit disturbed adjusting to these new changes that have occured within me, suddenly having multiple identities and u know this whole sissy thing feels weird to me at times. Today I am experiencing a bit of anxiety at times about these things and I think at times I am feeling some guilt about it again sometimes thinking of my mother who cares for me so much and my family, sometimes I am feeling I have done offence to my family. Today I am leaving for college and will totally focus on studies from tomorrow onwards. So I felt a great need to share my story with all of you so as to regain total mental peace and also become comfortable with these new changes. But I'll leave this fetish if I can't become comfortable.. Pls give some support and advice on the matter.."

I am not rich, I have enough money for my needs and I am largely content. I was asked by a client to come stay in Bengaluru, India for nearly three weeks and they put me up the Ritz-Carlton. They paid for the nicest room, all the club benefits, all the highest level things - they must have just went to the room selection and scrolled ALL the way to the bottom. Every single person here is effusive in their desire to please. When I checked in they knew I was coming, it seems like every employee in this building knows me by name and face. If I am not in my room there are people constantly asking deferentially if everything is okay, is there anything at all I need, can they arrange for a spa treatment, a haircut, a food delicacy, a car to take me somewhere. There's a special private club lounge for people to relax in. When Im in there if my eye wanders anywhere near an employee they immediately move towards me with the same question \"Is there anything you need, what can I get you, how can I help?\" It is deeply, profoundly lonely. With such subservience there is absolutely no human connection. Its like I am staying in a hotel with robots, perfectly crafted servant bots, with human seeming mannerisms. They whisper very quietly when I am around, and I can tell they try and stay out of earshot when they have actual conversations.Any attempt I make to engage them in small talk or have a normal interaction of some kind it is all viewed by them through the lens of a request for assistance. \"Any family at home?\" - \"Oh Sir, that is so kind of you to ask, yes i do have family at home. Do you have a family at home? Would you like to go shopping for them? Or would you like me to arrange for you to someone to take some pictures with our culture staff (dudes in local dress) to take some pictures for them?\" After a couple days here I tried flirting with one of the staff and that went bleak freakin fast. She got totally terrified, \"Oh no sir, there is no need, please you don't have to say that\" -- The girl was scared, she looked genuinely scared. I'm not James Bond smooth but I'm not the 'terrify women with my carnivorous compliments' type either. &amp;#x200B;I'm 10 days into a 20 day stay and I already feel bleak and drained. It is the exact opposite of relaxing. &amp;#x200B;I really can understand how the super rich get so warped now. I don't know how long I can take this."

I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to read this.**Relevant background/history:**\\- Mid 20s, diagnosed ADHD at 10, wasn't prescribed anything due to also having tics\\- Lots of drug abuse between 15-19. 100-500mg MDMA 1-2x/wk, mixing with psychs, etc. 18-19 cocaine a few times a week while drinking. Stopped all non-psychedelics after that.\\- Since 18ish have been tired all the time, 1-2L coffee per day, occasional month long periods of abstinence to see if coffee was the problem, always ended up back in same place\\- Depression and anxiety around 22, also late autism spectrum diagnosis. Doctor suggested that ADHD meds might also deal with the depression and anxiety. They did, and I also became way more capable of basic life tasks -- cleaning, groceries, paying bills on time, socializing, working, etc.\\- No ADHD medication worked for more than 3-6 months at a time. Since then I've tried Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin SR, Foquest, Biphentin, Strattera, about 5 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Modafinil, as well as a bunch of nootropics(racetams, choline, alcar, lions mane, uridine, etc). I've tried all dosage ranges for the ADHD medications, typically have settled at the top for both methylphenidate products and amphetamines, although I suspect with amphetamines I should have been placed closer to the middle or low end. Antidepressants all made things worse, amphetamines worked amazingly for a while and then started to induce paranoia/dysphoria/agitation/obsessiveness, methylphenidate products all worked great, although with a very short duration -- 2.5-3h effectiveness(e.g. SR would be 2.5-3h useful, 2 hours dip, repeat). Despite the duration issues, it's drastically helped everything from depression to anxiety to ADHD. Modafinil was great, but that was a different doctor and only for a month.\\- In the last year or so, I'll use methylphenidate as prescribed for a while, then eventually have 1-5 days of binging. It's not to chase euphoria as there really is never euphoria anymore, it's just to...actually be able to function for the majority of the day. I've never experienced negative side effects due to this(e.g. nothing like amphetamines, HR barely rises, no agitation or anxiety, can still sleep at the end of the day, etc.) with the exception of terrible comedowns and having less medication to actually use properly. People close to me don't notice that I've been taking more during the binges, they just notice that I'm more depressed and less productive on all the other days. Coffee is objectively more stimulating(alertness, anxiety, talkativeness, etc) than methylphenidate for me, even compared to the binges. But the doses scare me. The worst has been a few 24-36 hour binges of 600-900mg in 40-100mg increments. Lately it's more like 200-300mg/day for 4-7 days. It doesn't feel recreational, it's always functional despite being clear abuse. There are certain areas of my life that I struggle immensely to get in order with regular doses, and the binges seem to give me the clarity to actually figure out how to deal with them and take the needed actions.\\- I'm scared of talking to my doctor about this because it is the primary thing that has helped get the majority of my life in order, and at this point the only problem are the binges. I don't want to lose access to a medication that I'd be near non-functional without. I'd switch to Modafinil, but my doctor isn't comfortable prescribing it off-label, and generics from India don't have the same benefits for me, nor does Adrafinil.\\- I'm not sure what to do to stop this pattern. I already do all of the basic health stuff -- exercise, healthy eating, o3/b complex/vit D/magnesium/zinc, melatonin on days where I binge, etc.\\-One option I've thought of is keeping medication in safety deposit box and just walking half an hour to the bank every morning. Alternatively, I'm guessing taking NAC in the morning might help, possibly along with a week off. I dislike taking time off because after a few days of being useless my depression tends to get significantly worse -- it's by staying productive that I feel good about myself and avoid ruminating. One main issue is that invariably after a binge the regular doses do absolutely nothing, so I end up tapering down(e.g. 160, 140, 120, 100, 80) and then run out. So I'm thinking the most actionable time for intervention is when starting a script -- maybe I should start lower than my prescribed dose and try to get my body used to that? Or have careful behavioral interventions set into place(e.g. safety deposit box?)**My questions:**1. Given the history of going through all of this(22+) with the same doctor, are my worries about having the prescription taken away unfounded?2. Even if having the prescription taken away is a legitimate risk, should I still talk to my doctor?3. Assuming I don't talk to my doctor, any advice on what I can do to get this under control? Whether it be behavioral interventions or adjustments to my medications/supplements.4. How likely is it that I've done long-term/permanent damage through this? The majority of the research I've read seems to point to methylphenidate not being neurotoxic or particularly dangerous as long as the abuse isn't IV/insufflation, but I'm still concerned about this. Even after taking 1-3 month breaks the medication seems significantly less effective.5. If there's a non-negligible chance I've done long-term damage, what can I do to attempt to recover to baseline?6. Any other thoughts or advice is much appreciated."

        "selftext": "Over 150 million people in India require mental health care intervention  In view of the rising demand by corporators in Mumbai for setting up a dedicated hospital to treat the mentally distressed, there are plans underway to consider such hospitals and clinics. Shive Sena corporator has accordingly submitted a proposal to the administration for the same. Many people with mental illness do not know where to seek treatment, due to which their condition is exacerbated. An independent hospital, solely focusing on mental health disorders, can benefit them.As discussed in an **educational module** on\u00a0[**Medtalks.in**](http://medtalks.in/), India\u2019s fastest growing\u00a0**healthcare**\u00a0video\u00a0**education platform**\u00a0\\- An estimated 150 million people across India require mental health care interventions, both short and long-term, according to the National Mental Health Survey 2015/16. The overall prevalence of current mental health morbidity is 10.6%. Lack of awareness about the symptoms, the associated stigma, and inadequacy of mental health services have all resulted in a massive treatment gap in the country.Speaking about this, **Padma Shri Awardee, Dr. KK Aggarwal, President, HCFI**, **Editor in Chief IJCP and Medtalks and President-Elect CMAOO** said, \u201cThe symptoms of any mental health disorder are not marked but mimic other conditions most of the times. Most people only need basic interventions. Many have tension, fatigue, and body aches and pains and just need someone to talk to, sit with them, and support them. It is only when these symptoms are allowed to develop that things start getting worse, leading to more serious problems over time. Mental health problems including depression, in several cases, may also be strongly intertwined with major structural and social issues like poverty, domestic violence, and early marriage. It is, therefore, imperative to look at the issue holistically.\u201dAlthough 27% of India\u2019s districts have a mental health program, many are lacking a fully equipped team. Indians are not immune to mental health issues but do not believe they are suffering either.Adding further, **Dr. Aggarwal** said, \u201cQuantum physics explains that the mechanism of depression and anxiety can be an imbalance between understanding the way particle duality functions. Balancing this can further help in treating depression and other such mental disorders. The parasympathetic nervous system plays a vital role in maintaining both mental and physical health by helping the body to calm down from stress reactions that elevate blood pressure, dilate the pupils, and divert energy from other body processes to fighting or fleeing.\u201d**HCFI tips to practice a parasympathetic lifestyle.*** Consume a diet based on whole foods. This includes green leafy vegetables, quality protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.* Stay hydrated as this will help the lymphatic system flush out toxins and remove the metabolic waste out of the body. This is essential to detoxify, nourish, and regenerate tissue.* Exercise is a positive physiological stress for the body. Yoga, for example, is known to accrue great benefits to both the mind and body.* Practice mindfulness including a combination of practices, habits, thoughts, and behaviors to help you get through your daily life. Mindfulness means intentionally and actively seeking to lower the body\u2019s response to stress.A special video on the need for dedicated hospitals for people with mental health issues is available on u/ and can be watched by clicking:\u00a0[https://www.medtalks.in](https://www.medtalks.in/)**-Ends -****About MedTalks**Medtalks is the leading Indian platform for medical webinars making the latest research more accessible to doctors via live and recorded webinars updated weekly.

This has been the case for like a year - been really distracted and low energy and feeling a bit lost - and in March I took a few weeks off and went to a place in India called Rishikesh and attended a 2 week meditation retreat + certification program! It didn't give me any confidence in certifiation or coaching but it did benefit me personally in a huge wayBefore going to this place, I had hired an NLP coach and tried hypnotherapist sessions; nothing much helped. After this event, I realised I need to slow down and let things flow rather than go from place to place and try to control every little thing.This is where I got the idea of starting interviewing people using facebook live. I managed to do a few episodes even though this is something I have never done in my life; I stopped being trying to be perfect and just focused on getting something done. **Sooo.... Here comes the big idea...**One day I was watching my favourite youtube show \"London Real\", where top celebrities appear in these interviews. I thought Why do't I do the similar thing bit different way focusing on one single goal - This is where I planned **A VIRTUAL SUMMIT ON RESILIENCE;** Initially I faced difficulty in bringing speakers on to this show, but within 3 weeks of continuous effort, I managed to invite 30 speakers to the event - So now I'm pleased to show you The Unshakable Resilience - a 5-day, completely online event with 30 expert speakers! We're gonna have people from all across the world talk about resilience and improving yourself  and I even put together a bunch of perks which you can see on the websiteLooking forward to hearing from you and hope you can check it out here: [http://theunshakableresilience.com](http://theunshakableresilience.com/)tl;dr:I got bored working for a corporate all day and decided to put on a 5 day virtual summit on resilienceThanks,Ram"

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT MY CONDITION:I have been suffering from Anxiety, panic attacks, PMDD and depression for 3 years. During this time I contemplated suicide, almost ruined my marriage and was close to quitting my job.I have visited 15 psychiatrists/psychologists in four countries: USA, Singapore, Bangkok and India. I have tried a host of medication \u2013 SSRIs, benzos, MAOI etc. Currently I\u2019m on 10mg of Lexapro which has been helping a lot. While Lexapro go me 70% there, I was still not feeling 100% good and I was suffering from a lot from side effects like fatigue, drowsiness, nausea etc. It was then that I decided to take the summer off, take matters in my own hands and do my own research on what could heal me.

        "selftext": "Hi fellow Redditors. I'm a 25 year old male from India. For the past 13-14 years I have been suffering from severe OCD and other anxiety related issues. I also developed secondary depression somewhere along the road.My mental health has had severe repercussions on my life (for eg. failing my Bachelor's 4 times which led to me having 4 gap years) which my family and others, unbeknownstly attribute to my incompetence, laziness, incapability etc. My parents do sense that there's something wrong with me but I doubt that they think it's due to me being mentally ill. In April this year after deep contemplation, I finally mustered the courage to see a psychiatrist. My appointment with him was brief and he seemed only interested in hearing about my symptoms and treating them. He diagnosed me with anxiety and secondary depression and prescribed me antidepressants. Taking the medication did make me feel significantly better but I really hated the side-effects.I was all fine after that until I experienced something that triggered my OCD intensely. It's been about 5 months now that I have been trying to overcome this but in vain. I have once again spiralled into severe depression and to be straightforward am having suicidal thoughts.All that I want is my parents to know about my mental illnesses. I need them to understand that the reason for my erratic behaviour or incompetence or whatever has been due my mental illnesses. My mother is hyper religious and upon revelation will assume that I'm possessed and will ask me to resort to prayers. My father is quite normal in such matters but at the moment I can sense that he despises me. I'm absolutely terrified about how to go through with this but this is something that needs to be done.So, if any of you could please share some tips on how I can make this revelation to my conservative Indian parents, I would be grateful. Also, I apologise if I haven't been able to explain my situation properly, I'm not in my prime atm.**TLDR : I'm a 25 year old male from India and I need to tell my conservative/religious parents that I'm mentally ill. How do I do that without freaking them out?**"

        "selftext": "[Please delete if anything goes against the rules]Hello, so I'm a highschooler who was diagnosed with anxiety among other things. And I need advice, and a place to rant. Let me tell you guys the reason I need help. This may seem like gibberish because the main thing happened today, and I'm still a bit shake up. I have two stories to tell, one with my math teacher, and then what happened today. It involves my Science teacher and nurse. I am on mobile so bare with meMain Characters: M-Me, MT-Math Teacher, N-Nurse, ST-Science teacherSo the first story happened  2 weeks ago or so I was in my math class. The class is small because no one wanted our teacher. There is a massive cultural difference, she is from India and it's cool she is trying to help in the USA where I am located. But MT doesn't really believe in mental Illnesses. At first I would leave because I would have panic attacks and MT would always ask if I really needed to go. Then my friend and I both needed to go (he to suffers from anxiety but his parents don't believe him) so I asked if we could go to the library to study.  She said I could go, but Sam couldn't. I tried to say Sam suffers from the same problems as I do. But she told me to get out of her class, and that he doesn't have my issues. While I was gone, Sam told me that MT pulled him out of class and said this. MT:\"You are a strong girl\" she didn't respect his pronouns. \"You don't have that anxiety stuff, unlike that [my name] girl has\"I returned to class, and Sam told me this. I was so upset and angry. I wanted to punch MT, and I hate feeling like that. I restrained myself from doing so, and stayed in my seat, with Sam calming me down. We have talked to the principal about her because we had a drug presentation where they showed a boy overdosing (I can't watch people overdose because I saw my father and sister overdose). She told me I couldn't leave, and it was mandatory. It wasn't, other kids were allowed to leave. I couldn't return to school for 2 days and it set me back in therapy. I had nightmares and couldn't sleep for a bit. I was medically excused by the principal himself, this is important to to the second story. Second Story time! The main part happened today at school. So this is fresh in my memory, to say the least. I had science class 3rd period. I was gone, and they had changed seating again. I was put with this person I didn't know, nothing against him, but he took the whole desk up and would hit me with his knees and elbows. I went to ST to ask to move seats because I was very uncomfortable. ST said this \"No you can't sit by your friend, if you are changing seats, you sit up here with me.\" ST scares me and is just mean to me. So I tried to sit back down and calm down, it didnt work. So I asked to go to the freshman counlser. She said I needed to have her call ST when I got there. All the counlers were out for the day. So I was sent to N's room. I told her I was having a major panic attack, and I was almost crying. N just started telling me that I was making these problems up, and that they weren't as serious as I was making them out to be. And sooner or later I would have to get over this. I started to cry more. She sent me to the library, where I was supposed to work on my class work. But I went to the back and started to hyperventilate. ST came back and told me to grab my things and that I was going to class, and just walked away. Without asking if I was okay. I wasn't getting enough air, so I was about to faint. It's happened before at home. I just told ST no, and I was calling my grandma, she just rolled her eyes at me and left the library. My father was at work, and my mother was out of town for work. So I called my grandma and asked if she could come get me. My grandmother, being the saint she is, left work and said she was coming to get me. After she hung up, my panic attack got worse. I almost broke my pinkie finger, because I was pulling on it, and I pulled it to the side of my hand, I stopped after I felt the pain. ST came back in and said to grab my things and that I was going to a class down the halls. ST didn't tell me where. So I just said my grandma is coming to get me. She yelled at me saying I wasn't even supposed to be on my phone. So I left the library and went where she told me. I lucky liked the teacher she sent me to. She is the IEP teacher, I'll just call her G. G helped calm me down, and placed me in a room, where I waited for my grandma to come get me. Side note, I am absent alot from school do to my anxiety and agoraphobia (I think I spelt it right, but I'm scared of leaving my home and of people). ST refuses to give me makeup work, even if I have an excuse. I am failing her class. I have an F in her class, and the mid 9 weeks just passed. It's the second mid nine weeks. I'm so scared to fail this semester. I really need advice. My father is going down to the school tomorrow to \"talk\" with them. He is very protective and have made a teacher cry before because of a similar problem. Any advice will help. I'm scared I am just making these problems up, so please be honest, am I over reacting? Thank you for reading!"

Over the past three years, I've had one major goal in my personal life: To stop being so angry.Anger has been my emotional currency. I grew up in an angry home. Door slamming and phone throwing were basic means of communication.I brought these skills to my 20-year marriage. \"Why are you yelling?\" my husband would say.\"I'm not,\" I'd retort. Oh wait. On second thought: \"You're right. I am yelling.\"Then three years ago, an earthquake hit our home: We had a baby girl. And all I wanted was the opposite. I wanted her to grow up in a peaceful environment \u2014 to learn other ways of handling uncomfortable situations.So I went to therapy. I kept cognitive behavioral therapy worksheets. I took deep breaths, counted to ten and walked out of rooms. And I even meditated at night.These strategies helped me manage the anger, but they never really decreased it. It was like keeping a feral horse in a barn. I was contained, but not really domesticated.Then, six months ago, I was talking with Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist at Northeastern University. Right at the end of the hour-long interview, she tossed out this suggestion: \"You could increase your emotional granularity.\"My emotional what?\"Go learn more emotion words and emotion concepts from your culture and other cultures,\" she added.Over the past 30 years, Feldman Barrett has found evidence that anger isn't one emotion but rather a whole family of emotions. And learning to identify different members of the family is a powerful tool for regulating your anger, studies have shown.Or better yet, as I found, go and make up your own anger categories and start using them.What is anger?There's a common theory about anger. You'll find it in text books, scientific papers, news reports \u2014 even here at NPR. And some scientists support the theory, says Feldman Barrett.The idea is that anger is one of several \"basic emotions\" that are universal, Feldman Barrett says. It's almost like a reflex \u2014 hard-wired in the brain. When something unjust or unfair happens to you, \"your blood pressure often goes up. Your heart rate will go up. Maybe you'll breathe heavily or you'll have a reddening of your skin,\" she says. \"Then you'll have an urge ... to punch or yell at someone. That's the stereotype of what anger is,\" Feldman Barrett says.But it's not the full story.What you feel when you're angry depends on the situation, what your past experiences are and how your culture has taught you to respond, she says.As a result, there is actually enormous variation in the types of anger in the U.S., like exuberant anger when you're getting pumped up to compete in sports, or sad anger when your spouse or boss doesn't appreciate you.When you look at other cultures, the variation explodes.Germans have a word that roughly means \"a face in need of a slap,\"or backpfeifengesicht. \"It's like you're so furious with someone that you look at their face, and it's as if their face is urging you to punch them,\" Feldman Barrett says. \"It's a great emotion.\"Ancient Greeks differentiated between a short-term anger that doesn't stick around (\u1f40\u03c1\u03b3\u03ae or orge ) with a long-lasting anger that's permanent (\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 or menin).Mandarin Chinese has a specific word for anger directed toward yourself, \u6094\u6068 or hu\u01d0h\u00e8n. It's literally a combination of regret and hate, says linguist Yao Yao at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. \"You regret something you did so much, that you're angry at yourself,\" she says.Thais have, at least, seven degrees of anger, says linguist Yuphaphann Hoonchamlong at the University of Hawaii. \"We don't walk around saying 'I'm angry.' That's too broad,\" she says. \"We may start with 'I'm displeased' and 'I'm dissatisfied' and then increase the intensity,\" she says.And India is a treasure trove of angers.\"There's a common form of anger which means like 'when eggplant hits the hot oil,' \" says Abhijeet Paul, who teaches South Asian literature at Middlebury College.\"You suddenly become, like, really angry at hearing something shocking or learning something that you really, really dislike,\" Paul says.Indians also differentiate between political anger, which you have for the ruling class or \"boss man,\" and personal angers, which you have for a friend, family or neighbor. You would never mix the two and express political anger in a personal relationship, Paul says.\"There's also a very interesting anger that is a loving anger,\" Paul says. You express this emotion toward a spouse when your spouse has angered you but you can't help them, only love them, he says. \"It's a mixed bag of love, grief, sorrow and anger.\"Personalize anger to help regulate itSo in many ways, anger is like wine. There are these major varieties \u2014 such as Chardonnay and Pinot Noir \u2014 but each vintage has its own unique combination of aromas, flavors and potency. The more practice you have at detecting \u2014 and naming \u2014 these nuances, the better you understand wine.And if you learn to detect all the various flavors and nuances of anger and label them, you can start to handle your anger better, says psychologist Maria Gendron at Yale University.\"There's definitely emerging evidence that just the act of putting a label on your feelings is a really powerful tool for regulation,\" Gendron says. It can keep the anger from overwhelming you. It can offer clues about what to do in response to the anger. And sometimes, it can make the anger go away.The idea is to take a statement that's broad and general, such as, \"I'm so angry,\" and make it more precise. Take the Thai: \"I'm displeased,\" or the German \"Backpfeifengesicht!\"Psychologists call this strategy emotional granularity. Studies show that the more emotional granularity a person has, the less likely they are to shout or hit someone who has hurt them. They are also less like to binge drink when stressed. On the other hand, people diagnosed with major depressive disorder are more likely to have low emotional granularity compared to healthy adults.\"There's a whole arm of research showing how functional it is to have finely tuned categories for our experiences,\" Gendron says.Emotional granularity is like watching HDTV versus regular TV. It lets you see your anger with higher resolution, Gendron says. \"It gives you more information about what that anger means, whether you value that experience and choices about what to do next,\" she says.This last part is key: Being granular with you anger helps you figure out what's the best way to handle the situation \u2014 or whether you should do anything at all.For instance, if you are feeling a quick burst of anger, which you know will fade rapidly, then maybe doing nothing is the best strategy.And you don't have to limit yourself to the labels that already exist, Gendron says. Be creative. Analyze what's causing your various angers, give them specific names and start using the terms with family and coworkers.\"If you're making a practice in your family of coming up with words and then using them together, that actually can regulate physiology,\" she says. \"That can resolve the kind of ambiguity about the situation.\"Personally, I found this strategy the most helpful. I started paying attention to what typically triggers my anger at work and at home. And I found three major types, which I named.Illogical anger: This emotions happens when somebody at work makes a decision that seems completely illogical. Once I labeled this anger and started tracking what happens afterwards, I quickly realized that trying to convince an illogical person of logic is often futile \u2013 and a waste of time.Hurry up anger: This is the anger I feel when someone else is not doing something fast enough \u2014 yes, I'm talking about the driver of the gray Prius at the stoplight this morning or the 3-year-old who will not put her shoes on fast enough. Once I labeled it, I realized that cars, people and toddlers eventually move. Huffing and puffing doesn't make it faster.Disonophous anger: This is my favorite anger. And has the biggest impact on my life.I wanted to figure out how to decrease yelling at our house. So I started paying attention to what often occurred right before the screaming began. It was super obvious: The dog was barking and the toddler was screaming. Basically two loud sounds simultaneously.So my husband and I made up disonophous anger from the Latin for \"two sounds.\"Now when my husband says, \"I have disonophous anger, Michaeleen ...\" we know exactly what to do: Put the dog on the porch and pick up the baby.And I know he's not angry at me. He just wants some peace and quiet."

        "selftext": "Hello, I am a journalist in the UK who specializes in mental health issues, as I suffer from ADHD and OCD myself. I am doing a documentary on mental health in India, but I am going to focus not on the more severe (whatever that means) but less common mental disorders - a la Schizophrenia - and on the most common disorders - ADHD, OCD, and non-debilitating varieties of Anxiety and Depression. In essence, I want to see how people with mental illnesses that are serious but not totally debilitating, function within a sparse mental health system. I chose India not to navel gaze but because all countries, developing and developed, have insufficient mental illness policy and are filled with stigma, I want to show the more severe side of that stigma and poor resources in play with more 'common' illnesses, and, in addition, my partner is from India and has experience with this in his life. In any case, sorry for the long post but I just wanted to reach out to users to get reactions. Though I suffer from mental illness, I'm still have many gaps of knowledge and am ripe with ignorance. Is there any way you would recommend to reach out to a mental health community? What do you think I should be in particular sensitive to in talking to people with these disorders? In general just your thoughts on the topic would be much appreciated. Thank you all!"

        "title": "My brother is slowly going crazy and I don't know how to help him",
        "selftext": "I live with my mom and my brother. I moved back home after my father was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away about three years ago. I stayed because I managed to get a good job here and wanted to be with my mom and brother.Now my brother always had issues that he has refused to deal with. He gets angry very often and has OCD. His OCD feeds his anger in a a way. If everything isn't the way he wants it to be, then he'll get angry and start shouting at the top of his voice until he gets his way. Until last year, we had managed to keep the fragile peace by complying with everything he says. Talking to him to seek help is useless. It has only led to more shouting.Recently he has taken a turn for the worse. He got angry over something that happened at least 20 years ago. That's not a typo. He got angry over some criticism our mom made about his studies when he was in third grade. He started that fight three days ago. He calms down for a bit, behaves like the funny, sweet boy he can be but then invariably goes back to being the scary, angry guy. He has hit me and mom - kicks, punches and with a shoe. He got hurt during this when mom tried to stop him from punching me on the head. He got a single scratch on his hand. And it got worse from there. He's completely convinced that his hand is going to become infected and it'll need to be removed. Nothing convinced him otherwise - not even a phone call to the family physician. He only calmed down a bit after mom and I agree to cut ourselves on our arm- both of them. You can probably imagine our state of mind at this point. We agreed just for some peace. I'm completely defeated now. I just want this to stop. He screams all sorts of profanities at us - some true but mostly false. Hideous things that I don't want to repeat here. Things shouted so loudly that I'm sure everyone in our neighborhood have heard. I want to die of embarrassment but mostly of fatigue. Everyday I find myself dreading the moment he wakes up. I'm getting lesser and lesser amount of sleep because I want to enjoy the few house of peace when he's not awake. Leaving home is not an option because mom would never agree to abandon him and I could never leave her alone with him. She want to me leave - she's always urging to get a job somewhere else or get married. But how could I possibly do that? Sending him to a mental institution scares us because the facilities are terrible here in India. I don't know what to do.P.s - Apologies for my english and spelling errors."

        "title": "Difficulties dreaming",
        "selftext": "For as long as I can remember i\u2019ve had extremely \u2019realistic\u2019 dreams, not to mention i\u2019ve had what I believe is insomnia for all my life. Always had difficulties falling asleep, always had thoughts racing and i\u2019ve tried to ignore them, think of other things, i\u2019ve even thought of a paintbrush \u2019painting over the thoughts\u2019 so that they\u2019re no longer visible. Mindfullness has always been completely useless as it has no effect on me. Warm showers before bed, cool bedsheets, drinking warm milk, cutting out every screen imaginable (artificial light has been proven to decrease the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone), i\u2019ve tried everything. But more of that later.The dreams are usually just .. weird. Things that make no sense. I often dream the same thing over and over again. There have been times where i\u2019ve dreamt something very specific that later in life would actually happen. For example, I once dreamt that I was sitting in my mothers lap in a house with marble~ish floors and dark wood walls. Lo and behold, a few years later this exact thing happened when me and my family travelled to india: We went to a bank and I was sitting in my mothers lap, looked down at the marble floor, then the dark wooden walls and it instantly hit me. This is not the only time this has happened, I just used it as an example.Mostly, when I wake up I remember everything in the dream like it really has happened, and I\u2019m so confused so that I have to google things that I have dreamt in order to make sure if it\u2019s real or not. I have to ask others \u201dhas this ever happened?\u201d And of course, the answer is always no. Sometimes my dreams disturb me, like the times when I get chased, when I\u2019m naked in public, when I loose teeth or hair, when I harm others or when I do things that I know I can\u2019t do in real life, such as drive a car. I can\u2019t tell anymore if they are nightmares or not, because i\u2019ve gotten used to them so i\u2019m not really scared of them anymore, just sort of .. spooked.I\u2019ve had sleeping pills prescribed. At first it was Melatonine pills, I think 3 mg. And now I have Promethazine, 25 mg. The max dosage of it is 3 pills a day. There are times where not even that helps. Sadly, that is quite often.I love to sleep. I am great at sleeping when i\u2019m not supposed to. The longest i\u2019ve been unable to sleep is a whole week. The best kind of sleep for me is the kind where you don\u2019t dream.I live in Sweden, so the weather is cold, it\u2019s very dark since the sun doesn\u2019t stay up that long and when asked for help and tips, you get the \u2019ohh I hate when that happens\u201d but they just don\u2019t understand. When I tell them that \u2019no, it\u2019s not like that\u2019 they just say that they\u2019re there for me but they mostly just say that because they never say anything else. This is not because they are bad people, it\u2019s just the social norm here (sadly, lots of people in sweden are cold and don\u2019t care because that\u2019s how you have to be. You cannot show any signs of weakness because then you\u2019re just asking for attention)I just want these stupid, spooky dreams to stop and get a good nights sleep. I don\u2019t want to dream. Not even good dreams, I don\u2019t want to dream at all. I want to sleep.If there are any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to ask, I don\u2019t mind sharing, unless it\u2019s very private. Just please help me with this, I don\u2019t know what to do anymore."

I can't drive a car because lack of mental co-ordination, can't speak spontaneously, I read a sentence 10 times &amp; don't get the meaning, I can barely get my eyes straight at the sentence, I can't write or text correctly, I can't run continuosly for some distance without high Breathes, I can't keep anything in memory or store. It's like a near Alzheimer's disease. But my creativity has grown up exponentially.6 Years passed &amp; I can sleep 7 hours a day. Overtime my mental conditions have improved very slowly without myself noticing it. But I passed just only 40% of the path on the pursuit of getting normal. I was very obese &amp; high on appetite. Now I'm normal &amp; on near medium appetite. I think that it takes many more years to become normal as i have to compensate for the sleep I didn't have for that long period because it takes 10X the time of the period of sleep deprivation for the compensation of sleep.I'm 26 &amp; it's obviously the most productive age of everyone. I don't want to lose the most productive years. I want to quickly compensate the lost sleep &amp; get back normal. I have a life. Meanwhile I found this interesting article:https://m.medicalxpress.com/news/2009-10-reverse-cognitive-impairment-deprivation.htmlAnyone have any idea regarding a solution from this article?Please help me getting quickly on track by compensating the sleep. I might give your suggestions to my docs. Any other suggestions?Thank you. Love!"

I am in my sophomore year and it got really bad from November to now. It was so bad that I could not got to bed for days at a time and when I finally went to sleep it usually involved me passing out wherever I was sitting. Went to a my school's health center and they gave me a sleeping aid and also asked me to get tested for learning disabilities or ADD. The doctor told me to get tested after listening to me talk about my problems and after going through my academic history from highschool and college.I told my mom this and she started screaming at me about how I will become an addict and I am ruining my life. How do I explain to my parents that these are genuine issues and not me trying to not sleep or me being lazy and not want to study."

        "title": "To kids who have parents who disregard their mental health needs",
        "selftext": "I wrote out a long reply to someone whose family doesn't understand their mental health woes. If you are someone who has the need to try and convince your family or friends that your issues are real, perhaps this can help. I figured it might, so I thought I'd repost it here. The parental denial perspective is a common thing, and people don't realize the error in their perspective until it's often too late. There are many stories of, [\"but he/she was just the happiest kid. How could we have known?\"](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/02/12/suicide-note-16-year-old-renews-debate-about-pressure-top-high-schools) It's often because of a certain stigma some possess surrounding:1. Mental health in general (i.e. \"Just get outside and stop feeling so much self-pity.\")2. Younger generations in general (i.e. \"I've been there; You're just being dramatic/entitled.\")Yes, it is true that adolescence is almost universally marked by emotional difficulty and fluctuations in self-concept. This image of the \"angsty teen\" is what gives parents a feeling of nonchalance, especially because they can relate to the *quality* of the feelings, despite not understanding that in many cases, the *quantity* of the feelings is escalating. In other words, they understand how things feel in nature, but they do not understand that those feelings are increasing in intensity for many individuals. Normal or typical socialization has drastically changed even in the past ten years, and there have been massive effects on society. We definitely see them on a societal level, but fail to represent them individually. Here's the truth of the matter.&amp;#x200B;Loneliness and stress are common occurrences, and yet, they are feelings that decimate our physical health at alarming rates. Take, for instance, the findings being published within recent years:* [Loneliness Rivals Obesity, Smoking as Health Risk](https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk)* [Stress affects both mental and physiological processes](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of-stress-on-the-body) \\- see also: [How stress affects your brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuyPuH9ojCE); [How stress affects your body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-t1Z5-oPtU) **&lt;-- (These videos are great)*** [Personality disorders linked to stress](https://www.clearviewwomenscenter.com/blog/borderline-stress/) \\- see also: [Stress and personality changes](https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/mental-and-emotional-impact-of-stress/)&amp;#x200B;Since BPD (borderline personality disorder) is often tied to things like self-aggression and self-harming, it's no wonder that [we're seeing a rise in both self-harming behaviors and suicidal attempts](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/concern-over-rise-in-suicide-attempts-among-young-women) (see also: [Self-harm statistics are skyrocketing](https://qz.com/1136366/the-number-of-young-american-girls-turning-to-self-harm-is-skyrocketing/)). Please note that while self-harm is reportedly higher in young women, young men aren't exempt from this increase. In fact, while more women are formally diagnosed with depression, there have been studies which find that [men are often undiagnosed, but still diagnosable](https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/why-depression-underreported-men/). This is why, despite there being [higher numbers of suicide attempts with females](https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508), it has been found that [males are more likely to succeed in their suicidal efforts](https://healthydebate.ca/2017/08/topic/male-suicide). As stated in a previously linked article, women are 3x more likely to make suicide attempts, and men are 3x ([sometimes 4x](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers)) more likely to succeed. No one is exempt from this escalation.&amp;#x200B;Suicide is now the [10th leading cause of death in the U.S.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929.php), much higher than that of homicide. We are a greater danger to ourselves than others are to us. However, suicide as a whole is escalating worldwide. Look at [these](https://www.befrienders.org/suicide-statistics) statistics, for example.* In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.* It's not purely cultural, either. Almost 30% of all suicides occur in India and China.* **Youth suicide is increasing at the greatest rate**Life expectancy in the U.S. has actually fallen in the last few years in no small part [due to the suicide rate](https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2018-11-29/us-life-expectancy-falls-as-drug-overdoses-suicides-rise). That requires a drastic change for it to affect the life expectancy rate, and [it is increasing](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44416727). Rates are higher than they have been [in decades](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/29/18118601/suicide-rate-highest-decades-life-expectancy). Any suicidal behaviors or even thoughts are serious and require treatment. [Depression](https://secure2.convio.net/dabsa/site/SPageServer/?pagename=education_statistics_depression) and [anxiety](https://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-statistics-information.shtml) are their own difficulty. They are both a range of [diagnosable conditions](https://reference.medscape.com/slideshow/major-depressive-disorder-6009734) *and* symptoms of other conditions, dysfunctions, or disorders. For example, they are a common symptom of many [personality disorders](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/the-10-personality-disorders). On their own, [they disable individuals](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety) without leaving any detectable markers like physical disfigurements for onlookers to quantify with dysfunction (i.e. \"You look perfectly normal; therefore you're just being dramatic.\"). When an individual is unaware of the behaviors and their implications, it can provide additional stress and pressure, leading to further descent into both depression and anxiety (meaning that [depression and anxiety are cyclical and self-perpetuating](https://www.verywellmind.com/breaking-the-anxiety-cycle-1392987)). Most individuals go undiagnosed, [which can leave long-lasting psychological and physiological effects, and shape operative life perspectives](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/untreated-depression-effects#1). Many don't understand the implications (for [anxiety](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety), for [depression](https://www.verywellmind.com/depression-statistics-everyone-should-know-4159056)), and there's a definite divide concerning communication.&amp;#x200B;Due to the lack of understanding, empathy, or sympathy, many individuals hide their feelings away, especially if they have been previously stigmatized for their communications. It could have been nonchalance and a blatant disregard or ignorance (meaning ignoring) of feelings, or perhaps an aggressive opposition and denial of the situation. This is common with [kids and their parents](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/05/29/parents-and-teens/). Despite the difficulty in communicating and the awkwardness of the topic, [we need to communicate more](https://health.usnews.com/wellness/for-parents/articles/2017-09-19/why-we-need-to-talk-more-openly-about-suicide) clearly, more openly, more honestly, and more sympathetically. Many individuals are surprised to find out that most mental disorders can be neurologically quantified in most cases (i.e. [neurological quantification of BPD and symptoms](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/its-all-in-your-head-borderline-personality-disorder-and-the-brain-c14b66eb0966)), [which tends to incite more sympathy](https://daily.jstor.org/empathy-mental-illness/). Either way, we need more kindness and trust in the way we communicate. These feelings are often hidden, and [they can have very serious repercussions](https://www.bridgestorecovery.com/depression/the-dangers-of-hidden-depression/). They're often hidden, because we think of them as bad things. They are just thoughts and feelings, and we need to deal with them. [They are natural reactions to our environments](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-changing-culture/201410/why-so-many-people-are-stressed-and-depressed), and we aren't so often at fault for the way we feel. The reason [so many young individuals are talking about it these days](https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/December-2017/Millennials-and-Mental-Health) is because we have to, be it out of solidarity or sympathetic expression. In many ways, it is the best chance for change and support these individuals feel they have.&amp;#x200B;If you are depressed or overly anxious to the point where it affects your day to day function, it needs to be taken seriously. If you are self-harming, it needs to be taken seriously. If you are experiencing suicidality at all, be it passive thoughts or active ideation, it is not normal nor healthy. It is indicative of something else going on, and it needs to be taken seriously.&amp;#x200B;I hope you find a way to communicate with your family. This is not something that you should have to deal with alone, and they certainly do not understand the pressure they are putting on you. I made this post to perhaps help you find the courage and ability to convey this information to them - even to the length of showing this to them. They need to know, and you deserve the help."

TL;DR on the situation is that myself, friends, family etc have tried to encourage her to see a psychiatrist or voluntarily section herself to no avail, and so far we have been unsuccessful in getting her involuntarily sectioned.My current problem is another one. Does anyone have experience themselves or with others re: FB/FB messenger and sex video calls etc? She gets 100+ friend requests per minute and on average nearly as many incoming FB messenger video calls with men masturbating. Most of the men are from India and the Middle East. How have they found her? Is this normal? Is it a simple case that she has been hacked etc? Is it possible she has unwittingly exposed herself online somehow (not physically necessarily, but her identity et al).We have deleted the apps etc but know that at anytime she could just download them again.When she has the apps she approves all requests and takes the incoming calls. She finds the sex video calls hilarious (and as part of her illness thinks they are an evangelical army coming to protect her). Does anyone have experience with anything at all remotely similar? How did you safeguard your friends and family?Thanks in advance for any insight."

        "title": "[NEED HELP] A close friend revealed he was contemplating suicide. I'm stumped. [URGENT]",
        "selftext": "He is a close friend from high school. Though we studied in the same college, he sort of stayed away from the gang of friends I was in. We all presumed, he felt comfortable that way. But only during the final year of college did we realize he was battling severe depression. He had somehow developed an **Inferiority complex** which led him to not actively participate in activities in college, which resulted in a vicious cycle that prevented him from socializing, which he wanted to do in the first place. He powered through and landed a job in a reputable company with a damn good salary. We thought he would \"get over it\" and move on, but the problem only got worse. Fast forward an year,on a random day I get a call from him saying \"dude, I'm at the railway station, I'm off to someplace, I probably won't return\". I convinced him to wait right there, and hurried to the station and got him back to our house. He had no clothes in his bag- just a couple of books. He didn't talk for a couple of days (like literally a word). We had to ask him if wanted food, water or to go to the toilet. Slowly he started talking, but only in small sentences and broken ideas. He would start off like \"why did I...\" or \"did you know.....\" and then shut himself down. After a week, when we again started to converse in full sentences I took him to a counselor. **He never spoke a word to the counselor.** The counselor said to me later he is exhibiting symptoms of severe depression and possibly paranoia and that a group of friends would never be able to take care of him. Next day I took him back to our hometown and explained his parents the situation and asked them to take him to a psychiatrist. They were quite understanding and considerate of the situation. It has now been 1 year, though he is now in a much more stable state than he was 1 year back, he is refusing to go see a therapist. He now says that his problem rises from his lack of special talents; he is somehow convinced he is the dumbest person ever. He says he is trying to be happy by developing a hobby (writing). But for the past few days, when I went to visit him, he has been subtly revealing to me that he is seriously considering suicide. Whenever I slowly talk to him about his career and his wonderful abilities (he is an extremely bright student, school valedictorian) to convince him to go to a therapist, he outright rejects the idea. He has developed this thought process: \"Nothing we do is ever of any use in an universal scale, so nothing matters. Hence, I have already lived my life and the future holds nothing new for me.\" Today I took him out for a quick snack, and he confessed that sometimes he gets impulses to commit suicide. I got shit scared and urged him to come with me right now to see a therapist. He again wiggled his way out of the conversation, and told me \"Look, I'm trying to set a new path for myself through writing. For me it is an alternative to whatever therapy sessions you are suggesting. But if it doesn't work, I hope you will save me.\" And he started crying. I'm really afraid for my friend. Please give me advice on how to handle this situation. If it helps, I'm from the **south of India.** "

I have this friend (who shall hereby be referred to as Z), who has recently fulfilled a long held ambition of going travelling across Asia. Z was always the quiet one of our group, and had a dark sense of humour, but never seemed to be any more troubled that the rest of us (we're a group of 4 guys from a working class background in the UK fyi).Anyway, once Z had flown out to India and we were keeping in touch via social media messaging, we started to notice the changes. He became increasingly despondent and difficult to talk to, becoming increasingly cryptic and metaphorical and evading even simple questions on where he was and what he was doing. After about 5 or months of this, Z was suddenly back home one day (The likely scenario was that he'd run out of money). From there we spent about a month as we always did, just like before he left, in person he was the same as he ever was in person but his online persona was becoming increasingly apparent, very argumentative over social media but also plain incoherent at times, qualities none of us have ever seen from him in 20 years of friendship. When questioned or pressed about his erratic online behaviour by us in person he would act as if he didn't know what we were talking about. Then one day, he stopped leaving his house completely, elected to stay indoors and continue his online persona. He has no job, no desire to get one, is approaching late twenties and just spends his days and nights being argumentative online. I think it's also important to note he's developed an obsession with astrology and Buddhism, along with concepts such as karma and spirituality. Feel free to ask any questions about this as there are many details left out just to make this easier to digest, but my question isn't so much 'is my friend suffering from mental health problems?' more than 'what's the best way to deal with it?'

        "selftext": "First off..  i know where i am wrong, i know i am miserable, i know i don't have any correct justifications for the way i feel... or think.. so please spare yourself from commenting those.. I (24M) and my Girlfriend(23f) are on a long distance relationship. I am on a loan for my education and staying in Germany from the past 6 months. My girlfriend however stayed back in India. She has a best friend and he is very wealthy. Handles his fathers business and doesn't think twice before purchasing something.. she and him are best friends from 7/8 years and i am pretty okay with it. I met this guy, she kept everything clear from the get go and i was cool with it. I still am. We are fighting a lot now a days and she and I both aren't in our best stations mentally.  I am overthinking a lot and leaning onto anxiety and depression... i wasn't this way. That guy always wants the best for her and takes care of her in such scenarios. He visits her place every once in a while and i am completely fine with him.. she kinda gets these panic attacks and i am grateful for him being there to look after her in her sickness. I am not that well off economically and come from a middle class background.  I really want to buy many things for her and my parents but actually can't considering my money situation. We kept it this way and she knows this.. we kept it clean from the get go.. (3yrs) that economically we will split everything, share everything until we are in a position to lavishly spend. This time was different, when he visited her place... gifted her an Ipad, an Alexa thing, and let her shop for around 30k INR. He spent around 1500 EUR or 1600 USD just like that  because her mood wasn't right. I meanwhile sent her a package from Germany, containing the souvenirs i picked up for her when i was in Prague. She received them today. Some how both of these things happening at the same time put me into an emotional overdrive,  i just imagined a situation when she wants for something in the future but we have to think twice to afford, because she clearly likes costly gifts and she likes being pampered.  What if i am not that good enough. . What if i don't score up to their level of pampering(gifts and all). What if she wants more and i am incapable, i know that she won't,  she doesn't care what i am money wise or what i am gifting her .... but what if she doesn't want anything from me for that same reason. I feel down somehow hurt, somehow feel like i am poor and ain't doing anything right. I don't know if i should feel this mixed emotion of happy, jealousy,  insecurity, fear, sadness. I cannot justify anything that i am feeling. No body is wrong in this situation... not her, she didn't ask him to gift anything,  not him because it was just an act of kindness al be it a costly one. What should i be thinking.  I feel like i have been strong handed, this overwhelming feeling of insecurity money woes is killing me. I feel if he had thought of me before  atleast once maybe he would understand how i felt? Maybe he doesn't know or realize? But then again why should he? Maybe if she thought twice before accepting the gift, of how i would feel? Maybe she did, maybe she trusted me enough that she knew i wouldn't feel this way even of she did accept the gift? Maybe i am letting everyone down? Maybe i am the problem?I don't understand and i am not very stable right now people.? Any advice for me, on how i can be less miserable,? Or how i can improve myself?P.S. also they have a history together, once he proposed when they just became friends and she rejected him saying she didn't feel that way and still doesn't.. i am sure of that.. he seems cool with it and also they don't speak about it that much.TL;DR : My girlfriend's best friend(M24) Gifted her some very costly things and it made me insecure about my( m24)  position economically. Made me depressed and all things considered sad.very very sad."

Our hope is that it would help give us a general impression of what the students currently know/understand about topics like depression and anxiety issues. It would help if you guys could suggest some valuable questions that needs to be there in the questionnaire. Thanks in advance."

        "title": "Am I suffering from Schizophrenia or any other mental illness?",
        "selftext": "About me.Age: 20 yrs, Residence: India, Education: Currently in college.I am listing my possible symptoms below:1. **Lost in thought.** Nowadays I spent most of the time deep in thoughts where I am living a completely different life.The more time I spent on those thoughts the more I lose touch with reality. Most of the time I cannot stop thinking. Yesterday I only stopped thinking when I hit one of the furniture while I was thinking and walking. Most of the time I walk while I think. Here is one of the examples of what life I live in my thoughts: \"This one I started having from 3 months ago. In this thought I am a footballer and living the life of the footballer. The horrifying thing about this is I am spending say close to 1 hour in this thought(it never happens together in small intervals say of 7-8 mins but it happens throught out the day) and I live all parts of a footballers life from training, playing matches, doing press conference, travelling, having family. Its horrifying because it feels very real\". I currently live 2-3 other lives in one of which I am a famous businessman and other I am the PM.2. **Lack of concentration.** I think I havent been able to concentrate in a thing straight for more than 20 minutes. Most of the time I am trying a thing for say 7-8 min, then I get up from my seat and spent next 10 min deep in thoughts. Even when I have exam on the next day I am still unable to concentrate. Two months ago I have an examination and I had two day to prepare for it, what I did was I spent all the time like this not being able to concentrate. I always knew I havent read a single thing about it and tried to sit down and study but without any success. I only got to sit down and study only when I had 2 hrs left before the exam. This is not only one instance it is happening with me with almost every exam I just cant sit down and study at all irrespective of whether I like the subject or not. Even while writing this post I could not count the number of times I got lost in thought.3. **Feeling of superiority.** Sometimes I feel I am a superior being, I am much more mature and much smarter and feel my friends or family will never be able to understandand me or do what I can do.4. **Struggling with the basics of daily life.** I have stopped taking care of myself. My mom has been asking me for past 2 weeks to get a shave and get a haircut because they are looking awfully bad and I am completely aware of the fact. I havent applied any soap or lotion to feets for months even though the climate is very dry. I dont cut my finger nails on time and hardly care how I look. I face trouble staying on schedule or finishing what they start. Sometime when I start something I am unable to complete it. I have started around 30 courses on coursera in 2 years but havent completed any. On average I complete first two weeks in 2-3 days then I abandon it.5. **Lost connection with the society.** I havent had a meaningful conversation with anyone for months and I hardly talk with anyone without my needs. I dont like attending any event. Even when some of friends make plans to go out and invite me though I sometimes go out with them but most of the time I feel like staying at home inspite of knowing I will have a great time with them.6. **Other symptoms.**  loss of pleasure or interest, difficulty in remembering, difficulty in understanding instruction.It would be of great help if someone can guide me what I should do now. If I should consult a physician should I consult someone in general medicine or any kind of specialist."

She is my first cousin and I just get my eyes wet when I see my aunt and uncle suffering from this. She frequently breaks stuff recently broke lcd tv, broke all cups and stuff made up of glass. She gets in this hyper state for no reason.She has to be admitted to hospital for her being in better state but that literally costs double the amount my uncle earns per month.

The end goal for any student going there is to get a job there. For one, you want to make up the ton of money you spent to get your education. Secondly, the standard of living is just so much better there. It is just a better life.Even though I did well in college, my mental health prevented me from landing a job mostly because I didn't try very hard. I was partially hospitalised around the end of college and engaged in self harm, suicidal ideation etc.Now I'm back home working long hours for little pay. And the guilt is just eating me up. All that money my parents spent on me was wasted. All the time and energy I spent to have a better life was for nothing. I will never be able to make it up. I miss the life I had there. The guilt is the first thing I feel when I wake up and the last thing I feel before bed. I don't know how to deal with it. Therapy hasn't helped much for this.So my question is, how do you guys deal with the guilt of missing out on an opportunity because of your mental health? How do you deal with the fact that our issues can prevent us from achieving what we truly are capable of?"

I am not an atheist, but an agnostic who believes that there must be a God, because Science breaks down at one point (for me - what happened before the Big Bang? Why are we the only planet with life?) I don't pray, because I don't feel a connection with God. I was raised as a Hindu. I grew up around religious, devout people. But once I was an adult, I started questioning these very beliefs. I have read about other religions, mostly Christianity and Islam. I am not convinced entirely by any of the major religions and their practices. And where there is doubt, there cannot be trust, and there cannot be prayer. I wish to establish a connection with some superior being, what is the way to go about it? Do I need to seek a spiritual Guru, or a psychiatrist? Or do I look within and try meditation/mindfulness etc? Many thanks "

I find it easy to learn stuff I find intriguing, and have immense love for subjects like Astrophysics and Cosmology, but I find it really hard to concentrate for longer periods of time. The Good: I consistently achieve great ranks/positions in most competitive tests, have more than a few medals in a number of STEM related fields. I have an SAT in the 99th percentile (low 1500s), and also 790s on two Subject Tests (Mathematics II and Physics). I also authored my first book in junior year and the second one in sophomore year. The Bad: I struggle in high school, cannot seem to care about school administered tests (sub 75% aggregate scores). I feel like a sociopath at times, for I can manipulate most people into doing what I need of them, but I choose to also humiliate them consistently. I also have inconsistent character, as I might be empathetic/caring one instant but an asshole the other. I get distracted way too often by unusual things, like reading Reddit, Quora, or Facebook. Other distractions include random Rubik's Cube solving urges, craving oddly specific food items, or just aesthetically organizing my stuff. I also seem to have erratic short term memory and forget stuff that popped up in my mind seconds ago (there are too many things in my brain at one time). The Ugly: I am toxic. While I explain subjects to people with patience at first, if they do not understand it at one go, I turn cocky as to their ineptitude. I also feel that I am turning painstakingly elitist, as I look down on people with scores lower than mine (I do not act on these thoughts, obviously.

This was one of them: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/narcissism/2016/04/watched-and-judged/I realised that many of the symptoms of anxiety I experience are a result of having lived through years of narcissistic abuse. It was often physical but almost regularly verbal. It's strange how I never realised it before today. It was emotional bashing targeted at almost every aspect of me that did not agree with his expectation. Introvert? Sensitive? Carefree?  I noticed this pattern immediately in the way he treated my mother as well. He was never physical (I trust my mother's word on this one) but he was certainly verbally destructive. Both of us have serious self-esteem issues today.Now here's the catch. I still want his validation, even after realising this and I still feel sorry for him. He had a tough life (in his own words) and went through a bad phase.He has a grip over his anger issues now and he's a more restrained person but he still uses the same arguments and tactics when he speaks. I'm quite confused and my emotions are in a completely jumbled up mess. I don't want to blame everything wrong in my life on one man but it's also plainly true that what he did was violently abusive.What can I do to stop wanting his validation and acceptance, move past it and actually become my own person? p.s. I am from India and I currently live at home with them. No job, no hobbies, cut ties with most of my friends. You get the drill."

The following is my train of thought on the subject.  I've developed a preference for a certain drug which I can take all day everyday, I've done it before for periods of over a month (not healthy, I know). What I came to realize in this thought process, is that in the long term, I've been using as an escape from the expectations I've set for myself, and that the markers I use to fulfill these responsibilities are set by two things: 1.) I need gratification from others for my efforts in whatever I do (including this post apparently), 2.) the amount of gratification I deem significant to my work is dependent upon the amount of gratification I see others getting. (I will always think comparatively)I've logically accepted the fact that the amount of gratification I receive for my work is dependent on myself, but there is still a constant visceral sense that I'm not good enough or that the people I see obtaining the 'rewards' I want, shouldn't be getting them.What I have thought, is that, although more popularly received, I see people's work which is similar to my own and automatically think that the gratification they receive for it is unjust, or at least it makes me feel inferior. I've concluded that the best way to solve this terrible feeling of mine, is to get a better understanding for the effort that people have put in to reach their goals; to understand what makes them who they are and contrast it with my own life path. This at least gives me a rational argument against myself if needed, and gives me different pathways to success that I've never considered before. In short term interaction, I find evidence for my lack of empathy in that I complain and talk about myself way too much in conversation (seemingly seeking more saturated emotional responses from people, AKA attention). I also feel that lately I haven't been as involved in conversations as I used to and can see other people much more invested in shared conversations than myself. I don't laugh at jokes, I have weird eye contact with other people in social interaction, and the overall subject matter, while sometimes seeming universal, I feel like doesn't apply to me. All of this I feel can be fixed/mitigated with a further understanding of the practice of empathy. TL;DR: Do you feel that a greater understanding of empathy can induce better feelings of involvement in social life? Are there ways to change one's visceral/immediate feelings to social stimuli through a variation of empathy? How could this variation be achieved?I hope this conversation can be applied to more lives than just my own, empathy is a basic building block of social interaction and can almost always be improved!"

        "title": "Advice Need for Deteriorating Mental Health of Mother",
        "selftext": "This is a post for a daughter that needs advice for a mother that has struggled with mental health.  Apologizes in advance for the long post and also as a forewarning this is my first post/I\u2019m pretty new to Reddit.My 50 y/o mother has been having progressive mental health deterioration over the past decade and alarmingly more issues the past few years. I\u2019ve always known she has had mental health issues but given my family\u2019s culture, it\u2019s been kept under wraps and a secret only known to my mother\u2019s parents, my mother\u2019s husband/my dad, and myself. My mother and father have not been transparent in what exactly my mother has been diagnosed with but I believe it is bi-polar disorder and mild schizophrenia. She was diagnosed in college after having a breakdown and ever since she\u2019s been on medication. Up until middle of my high school, she was 70% of the time-a normal person/mother, kind happy, relatively smart, would constantly change jobs (entry level retail) but was able to work and also be a housewife. Every now and then, I\u2019d see changes in her mood/behavior that exhibited her mental health struggles and maybe every five years she\u2019d have a break down that would require hospitalization. All of this was pretty manageable to me and my father.The major change came while I was in high school where I think she somehow got a doctor\u2019s authorization that she was no longer mentally fit to be able to work (which I didn\u2019t believe was the case) and she was able to file for disability. In my opinion this was the biggest mistake and beginning of a downward spiral. At first, I didn\u2019t notice a change in her mental health. She kept busy through hobbies, being a housewife, volunteering at our church, spending time with me and my dad. However, there was another big change for her when I went to college. Pretty much after I went to college, I had never moved back home. Since I\u2019m an only child and relatively unpopular/average in middle school/high school, I spent a lot of time with my mother before college. I think my moving out was a huge impact on the socialization of my mother. My father is a pretty quiet personality and spends majority of the week/weekend on a set schedule. He works Monday-Friday and goes to the gym after work so he only spends a few hrs a night with her during weekdays. He also cooks, cleans after himself, does all of his laundry (lack of housewife things to do for my mom). So basically after my high school, my mother is mostly alone and not really socialized. She has two friends of an off and on relationship where she\u2019s ostracized them in her bad times and I don't think she is in contact with them anymore. My parents have family friends that host get-togethers for major holidays, but they are all much closer to each other than my mother is to them (she\u2019d never call or see the women directly) and lately she doesn't even want to go.Fast forward to today, I\u2019m currently 27, it\u2019s been a little over a decade since my mom stopped working. My mother is not someone I recognize anymore. All of the personality that I described prior (the 70% of the time) I have not seen in the past 6 years. I\u2019d say what used to be her mildly bad days from before are the norm with a lot of really bad days/stretches in between. As far as I know, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s had a breakdown bad enough to be hospitalized but it could have also been hidden from me (she\u2019s also terrified/paranoid of this from prior experiences). I\u2019ve had serious talks with her of how I\u2019ve seen such a huge change in her and how I\u2019m worried and have urged her continuously to either get a job or volunteer (she'll try and never follow through). She\u2019s very reluctant to get a job because she\u2019s afraid of losing her disability but I\u2019ve argued that it\u2019s been far worse for her mental health than helpful. She also has lost a lot of her confidence, mental ability, socialization, etc. over the years and has almost regressed to a child-like state. I feel like she has the ability to do so much but she just doesn\u2019t use her mind and falls victim to \u201cuse it or lost it.\u201d She has no hobbies, doesn\u2019t read, rarely watches tv, sits in alone in her room, \u201ccleans\u201d (there\u2019s plenty of housework left undone), and only goes out to go grocery shopping. She also doesn\u2019t listen to my dad, she almost has a petulant/stubborn child-like attitude. There\u2019s seems to be nothing he can do to get her to do anything (get a job, volunteer, have a hobby, go to the gym, go to a family party, go to movies, etc.) lately. The only thing she continues to do is grocery shopping.I recently got engaged and had gotten married in India and despite all of my dad\u2019s requests, she refused to come (she claims it\u2019s too hot, even though she\u2019s been there 7 or 8 times and lived there for a few years, really she's paranoid we'll just leave her there). It\u2019s just one of many things she claims she can no longer do despite having done many times before. We\u2019re having another wedding in the states for all of our friends and family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s side of the family that couldn\u2019t make it. And I admit, part of the reason I\u2019m so motivated to finally drive some change in my mother is all of the wedding events that my mother has to attend (and will probably flip flop on wanting to come). But also, she\u2019s been probably the worst mentally even admitted by my dad (who to avoid confrontation with her usually lets her be even if she's still \"off\") recently. For example, she\u2019s left me 3 voicemails (she hangs up when I answer) that she will be busy until Feb 2019 (implying she can\u2019t come to the wedding). I\u2019ve been worried about her health for the past 5 years and I\u2019ve repeatedly talked to my mom, my dad, and so it\u2019s no surprise this has all happened. I\u2019m sure the stress of my wedding is a trigger for her (we made sure not to stress her with responsibilities), but it\u2019s really a culmination of everything and mostly her every day routine/lack of one.I have no idea how to get her to change and neither does my father. I can admit that we were probably not the best caregivers for her because we have had no advice (apart from my dad going to her doctor with her) or have never sought out professional help. Everything has been kept in our bubble. Right now, my dad is not sure if she takes her medicine and has no ideas on how to get her better other than \u201ctalking to the doctor about increasing the medicine.\u201d I myself can\u2019t think of anything other than having my dad talk to the doctor and asking the doctor to recommend a psychologist/psychiatrist (always get these mixed up). The only extreme thing I can think of is sending her to a mental health treatment facility like a 3-4 week program (I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s such a thing?). The problem is, I\u2019m not sure if this would be a huge shock to her and also how to get her to even go when she refused to leave the house?Selfishly, I wasn\u2019t too upset that she didn\u2019t come to the wedding since sometimes it\u2019s stressful to deal with her when she's in a negative state of mind. There was a point a few years ago, where I mourned that the personality of my mother has died and the person left is basically a shell with the malignant alteration of her personality resulting from her diseases. However, I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019s something I missed and maybe some way to revive her. Any advice is greatly appreciated and thanks for reading."

        "title": "Is my life so complicated and confusing because of an abusive father ?",
        "selftext": "So, This will only be an attempt to all I can gather in my brain at this moment. I am 30 years old who lives in New York now but was born in India. My father was a very verbally, emotionally and physically abusive person. I started realizing that when I was 8 or 9. He would yell at me for the littlest things and would make me feel like such shit. He would curse me out and talk to me like I was his slave and I was a Mistake. Irony is, I was actually a good kid. I truly do have a good heart. Now, Dealing with him.. Crying endless nights, suffering and praying to the sky to just take me away and try to dodge seeing my father was almost an everyday thing. Fast Forward to 16 years of age, My whole family moved to New York. I left behind all my friends and my cousins and family back in India and came to a country where I don't know jack. He was still with us and I hated every inch of him. Parents got divorced when I was 18 and that made my life breatheable. Still, I was very depressed and I had such low self esteem. Now, The problem is that I feel like if Anyone shows even remotely any empathy towards me, I go for it because I see some light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like, my life has been shit, maybe this person can actually make a difference and make me feel special. It starts off that way and then self doubt in my mind about that person leaving or knowing me further will know that I am not deserving enough or I am not good enough and would leave me. So, the uncertainty is always there. I am actually a good guy and I treat girls right. I want to be in a committed relationship. I want to have kids and have a great family but I am so doubtful that I would make a great role model because a part of me still feels so low about himself. I feel like I am anti-social and I doubt every move I make. There are times that I don't feel that but I don't know when I would get back in that funk of mine. I don't know what I should do. I have tried going to a Psychologist but that didn't really help as it was expensive and it takes forever to reveal your full self to that person and then not hear any proper feedback just doesn't help. I am on dating websites and I know I look decent enough.. But I wouldn't get a proper response from someone decent. My self esteem is so shot right now. Thanks for listening Reddit, I hope I can get some helpful answers here."

I feel sad/angry/frustrated most of the times. Not able to feel happy for long now, smile and laughter are mostly fake and are for the sake of daily life situations. There are few things which I want to discuss:I don't know how to have fun. I just don't. Earlier it was gaming, movies, series that used to be fun but nothing appeals anymore. Specially after breakup(about 7 months ago).I feel helpless and as if I am mere surviving and not really living. Worst part is I don't know how can I change that. I don't seem to have dreams anymore. I had just one dream- to emigrate for studies and experience life in foreign land. Now it's not possible due to fucked academics and age.Staying alone sucks for me, staying with people sucks for them. I don't know what to say and what not at most of the times. I have become socially awkward even though I am socially active as I stay mostly in my head, irrespective of my physical presence.I have tried 'Vipasana', but not able to concentrate anymore in the practice. I am not able keep my focus for long. It may be anxiety. I am missing the energy, the spark that is required in life. I walk a mellowed down, tired walk, which even I am starting to hate. I have started workout though.Does it sound like a tensed phase of life, or something is really off with me? Should I seek professional help? suggest some in Delhi-NCR please. Thanks."

Later, around the age of 11 I had a tutor who turned out to be a pedophile and put his hand on my thigh and basically made me uncomfortable.Ever since I can remember around the age of 8 maybe later, I've had panic attacks. I also suffer from asthma so as a child the symptoms used to mix up. Therefore until I was 14 years old I had blocked all of this out and failed to remember any of it. No one knew, I still had panic attacks and night terrors regularly as a child though.Eventually ever since 14 years of age, it started coming back to me. Ever since then my panic attacks have only gotten worse.I had been severely depressed from the age of 12 to 16, I'm better this year although my mind still goes back to suicide way more often than it should even though I do not want to carry it out.I have discussed this with my orthodox hindu parents multiple times and they do not want me to get therapy or see a psychiatrist. I don't believe in god either or any metaphysical force. However, my family disagrees and believes I'll get better all on my own.But basically even though I know this blog isn't replacing therapy I'd still like some help.I feel that my ptsd is definitely getting worse. It got so much worse last night when i had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. Which brings me to my next point. When I was panicking I feel like I was hallucinating last night. I know I saw something because I ended up sleeping for 2 hours and the next night, I still don't want to go to sleep. That's how terrified I am.I do however graduate in two months, giving my law entrances in May and hopefully I'll move out by August. I have enough cash saved up to pay for about 3 months of weekly therapy. Perhaps that'll work.But for now, I need help but I don't know how to get it. My parents are ridiculously strict, I'm not even allowed to talk to boys.I do however not comply. I have great friends and an amazing boyfriend that really do try to help. I do not have access to any medication and I simply wait for the panic attacks to pass. Therapy or a psychiatrist isn't an option for me this year at all, I've tried, but please advise.Thank you &lt;3"

        "selftext": "Apology in advance for a long post, but I need to recount a lot in order to express the problem clearly. It'd be great if professional clinical psychologists could throw some light on my problem, but even if you're not one, feel free to share if you have an insight.It all started when I was about 14-15 years and in school (I'm in my mid-twenties now). I had had a very high self esteem up until that point because of my excelling in academics back then, and also for having a very good reputation among and relationships within my social circles. However, I had by then realised that I belonged to a **lower caste (a hereditary social identity like race in India)**. Soon, I also started reading about the history of and contemporary news related to caste discrimination and violence in my country and region, and prevalent caste customs like marriages between higher and lower castes being unpopular, and became acutely aware of conversations and attitudes related to caste in the larger social milieu I was living in. This newer awareness had made me **progressively insecure** about my self as it was far removed from the very positive social image I had of myself until then. I had subsequently faced taunts about my social and linguistic identity on a few rare occasions from classmates. Though they were not too offensive or derogatory in nature, I was already very insecure and withdrawn. I had started daydreaming a lot and imagining scenarios where I would be insulted, discriminated against or physically attacked because of my identity. I had developed some degree of **social anxiety** while moving about in public spaces. I had become **extremely introverted** and was always anxious while talking to people and could freely talk to only my few friends by the end of high school. **My very confident and ambitious nature had turned into an insecure, introverted and oblivious self.**I was still doing fairly well in my academics, and even without the desirable amount of effort and determination I went on to study in medical school. With the newer environment I tried to shed my image of an introvert and **started to engage socially**. I had subconsciously repressed a lot of the identity-related issues in my mind and that eventually helped me to suppress the premonitions and anxiety to a large extent and engage socially more and more with time. However, with that, my ego and sense of self became very diffuse. Because of the lack of a definite sense and awareness of self and ego, my personality was kind of variable depending upon the social situation and I was simply going with the flow socially, academically, etc. My emotions were considerably numbed and I didn't really feel happiness, sadness, jealousy, love, insult, etc. anymore and couldn't empathise emotionally with other people. The boundaries between self and other seemed diffuse. Although I made friends, I couldn't connect deeply with most people.Not surprisingly, I soon faltered academically and failed several exams because of the lack of focus. But, this too didn't affect me too much emotionally because of the self-obliviousness and diffuse ego. I didn't have the part of the brain that thinks about *'what are other people thinking about me/ how do they perceive me?'* anymore. My diffuse mind-space seemed like an universal space which everyone shared-*if there's no self then how could there be feelings or thoughts against the self*. I was also **projecting** such diffuseness of mind, thoughts and ego on other people. The ego diffusion is kind of like what some people describe as the loss of ego in meditation and drug trips, but this was less in intensity and seamless with my perception of and interaction with reality.However, after recurrent academic setbacks, I had started thinking rationally about what I was going through. I faced my insecurities, and subsequently resolved them after a lot of reading and rationalising about the sociological and psychological origin of my insecurities. I started becoming more aware of my 'self' by analysing my thoughts, experiences, feelings, etc. from scratch. I would often get *epiphanies* about some aspect of my previous 'normal' self and that would bring in an **existential crisis** sort of experience that would result in me crying a lot every time. I've graduated med school, but, the lack of clarity still persists. I went to a therapist for a while, but she was unable to pinpoint the problem. I'm a lot more self-aware now and able to distinguish between self and other a lot more. Emotions surrounding the self are still absent, including desire, attachments, passion, love, which render me without focus in my social, academic/professional lives. My family is concerned as I'm not doing a lot career-wise at the moment, though they know very little about the issue (I've opened up to few friends and my sister till now). Because of the lack of emotions and partially persisting diffuseness of the sense of self, emotional empathy is still affected, although I think cognitive empathy is intact to a large extent. **I've tried to make sense of what I've been going through, but haven't come across anything that seems identical. I believe that the insecurities caused the social anxiety, to suppress which I've developed this weird psychological state because of a subconscious defence mechanism.** There seems to be some aspects of narcissistic personality disorder, but most of it doesn't seem to match. I want to feel again, form deep emotional relationships, develop a stable personality and sense of self, and above all lead a normal life. I've been making slow and steady progress on my own, but finally decided today to seek out for help online. I'd really appreciate it if someone has an insight on what I maybe going through. Thanks for reading if you've stayed with me thus far. :)"

        "selftext": "My realization that there's something inherently beautiful about women began with two things - James Bond movies, and the DIY constructed bathtub in our bathroom made out of brick and mortar. Born and bred in a small town in Bihar, our family was into Hollywood movies, and I am talking a lot of James Bond here. This was the 80's, and we had a National VCR, which our family had bought from one Suleman, the local dealer who would smuggle the electronic items via the Indo-Nepal border. Watching all those James Bond movies, and specially the women of interest, and how scantily they dressed themselves in those movies, and how passionately they kissed James Bond, left an indelible impression on my mind. I would spend a long time inside the bathtub imitating the love scenes, and imagining that I was surrounded with those blonde women, sipping wine, and that all of them were drooling after me. I know what you are thinking. I was small then and it had not happened yet, and that is why I didn't know anything about masturbation yet. But I was totally into it, apart from the usual kid stuff, which in India back then also meant imitating our mythological superheroes aka Lord Rama , Lord Krishna and the likes&gt;\"You can call my bathtub act whatever, but I think back, rewind myself, and replay those moments back in my head. There wasn't any sexuality in it compared to how I see things today. It was a lot of passion, steam in it, and I would only imagine &gt;holding those blonde beauties in my arms and passionately kissing them.\"And it never seemed to end. I didn't know anything about masturbation and hadn't got through the natural process of discovery yet. So there was always this insatiable appetite and hunger, until the natural process of discover did take place. We had gone to the theater to watch a Bollywood movie \"Platform\", and as most of the readers would know a Bollywood movie is nothing without songs. Platform, the movie that we went to watch had a very hot number where the actress (who was new and it was her first film) performed in a song, drenched in rain and only wearing a shirt, the wet shirt clinging to her body and showing every contour of her curves. YouTube still has that song and you will understand what I am talking about.###The Discovery of Pure EcstacyThis was a mighty hit song, the movie became a hit just because of this number, and although embarrassed to watch this with my family, parents and aunts, and faking every bit of that embarrassment, I was consumed by a new form of energy. I got back home on a hot evening and headed straight to the bathroom for a nice cold bath. I don't what happened but inside the shower, I started imitating the moves of the song, imagining myself as the actress, and during one of the moves, I could feel that the pleasure reached a level where it felt just too good and I was ecstatic. It felt like I had never been happier than that moment in my life ever. I am writing this and getting goose bumps. It's been more than 28-29 years and I still remember how it happened and how I felt. Anyway the pleasure died down, and it wasn't until 2-3 days of involuntary repetition I realized that I was ejaculating.India being what it was back in the 80's, and I coming from a small town where sex education at school is a taboo, you can never get unluckier if that's the situation in your home too. Word among the school friends was that this was a life threatening activity. One session of ejaculation cost you a glass of blood, and where you to exceed your daily quota you will die out of Anemia. So there was fear, and because some students made it out against our culture there was guilt too because you couldn't control it. You just had the desire, you had the temptation and you just did it. Things only normalized in high school and after that it was time to go to college.###Porn BeginsLeaving the small town and coming to the University of Delhi was a huge exposure. Internet wasn't in vogue yet, in fact large part of India didn't even know what internet was. I bought my first computer - a Compaq Presario and that is when my tryst with soft porn began. It all started with the desire to see someone with their bare breasts. And the more you looked, the more you got. It was actually okay for the first two years. I watched soft porn with beautiful music in the background, I didn't need my imagination anymore.&gt;\"I know you would say, get yourself a girl. But you are talking to a boy from a small town with his closed mind where having a girl friend automatically meant commitment to marry, and god only knows what it meant if you were intimate and physical with her. So you can say I chose the easy route although I did wish if I had one and I tried getting one on a Valentine's day when I gave a rose to a damsel and a stranger passing by. Let me just say it didn't happen.\"Slowly and gradually I moved to hardcore porn. The background music was gone and was replaced by the O yeah's and the moaning, and the screaming. The action was unreal and vigorous, and the time of it was unreal too. I mean how can someone carry on for that long.As time passed I kept getting better and kept discovering more stuff. &gt;You could find it everywhere, the more you looked for it, the more you got, and the more you did it. The more you got affected by it without even knowing that you were.###Fast ForwardI don't know how my sensory organs got transformed in the process. I discovered role play, different positions, and my fetish and desires had no end.&gt;\"Whatever I imagined, it was available in the porn version. Or &gt;was it the other way round?\"Whatever be the case, I was getting bolder and I could watch it and may be impersonate in my imagination that I was the porn male actor on the screen. I liked pulling the hair of my office secretary and engaging in a doggy style, making loud noise and most of the time punishing her for some work that she didn't do properly, or didn't finish, or imagining her as a slut, paying her price for getting that much needed promotion.I also like engaging in an act with a real estate agent, a doctor, a nurse, a cop, friend's wife. There's no end to it. There's no parallel to it in the real life. And a lot of times I sit back and remember and try to figure out how I got here. That entire feeling, emotion, and passion when I was in my bathtub being James Bond as a kid, that is gone. The desire to love someone by being physically intimate with her is dead. All I can think of when I see a woman is how good I will spank her if she is my office assistant. Back as a kid, the ejaculation part was the most ecstatic, it was a moment of joy. Now it is a moment of victory, power, abuse, and I don't know if I derive any joy out of it. I guess I am slaving it. Abstinence from porn has become a challenge in itself. Because I carry porn everywhere with me on my smartphone.&gt;\"Bottom line is that I have become incapable of having normal sex! And I want to get back to from where I started. I want to lead a life having normal, pleasurable, lovable, joyous sex. I just  don't know how to take it back yet.\""

        "selftext": "(Disclaimer: I'm aware of how stopping meds without the help of a doctor can be dangerous and all the other problems it might cause. I'm not looking for more warnings on how this is a bad idea. I take full responsibility for my actions. I'm obviously not a doctor and I don't recommend anyone try this.)I'm also not your typical case, I have fibromyalgia [which I had to figure out I had on my own] which I think is the main problem which has never really been addressed, despite seeing 4 different doctors. Although meds and doctors have been helpful in the past I think they are no longer helping me but ultimately hurting me.)I recently lost a job. (not my fault, corporate reconstruction) I no longer have health insurance and without it, my meds will be $500-1000 a month. I've been using meds for so long and they have become a burden and ultimately something that is hindering my growth and freedom. I'm not able to leave the state or country, travel, see friends, etc and I'm sick of it. Meds have become a ball and chain that have kept me down for too long. Not only is it that I'm dependant on them, but I have no say in how I go about treating my issues or going through the health care process as a whole. I have to pay insurance, set up appts with a psychiatrist, see the psychiatrist, ask for meds; Then I have to go ask for a prescription to be filled, wait for them and pay for them to be filled. This has to be done three different times a month, once for each med. Not to mention it's thousands of dollars for the whole process and it has to be done every month, ad infinitum. I've become so disillusioned with the entire process and I'm refusing to go through with it anymore as a form of protest as well as out of pure spite. After just seeing my psych and then having Walgreens say 'we will have to contact your doctor to fill this prescription, and also it's going to be $175.' was the last straw.I'm going to continue to take Wellbutrin as I do think it may be necessary at this point in time, however, I refuse to go through the aforementioned process for one little stupid med. I'm going to be ordering it online from Canada/India through one of the many sites where you can order prescription meds. This is not only much cheaper but also much easier as I just have to put in a credit card number and I can get 3 months worth at my door in a few weeks. Bam. I'm in the process of weaning off my other meds and at this point in time, I feel fine. I've been taking supplements that seem to address and help fix a lot of my issues. I have more energy, can think more clearly and my mood is better. It seemingly does a better job at addressing my issues than the meds I was prescribed as I feel they just cover up the problem and don't address it. Hopefully, this will be a way to get out from under the grossly dysfunctional health care system and allow me to better live the way I want to. "

I am unaware of this the laws of confedentiality in the US. I feel that if she had some clarity on laws, she might be willing to seek help from the right people.

        "selftext": "I don't even know *what* to call it. It's as though I have an addiction to misery. Specifically (I guess?) it's procrastination. A horrible, self-destructive predisposition towards doing a thing that I know perfectly well brings me anxiety and pain and just makes me feel worse and worse and worse. You'd think addiction would have some kind of... 'feel good' effect, somehow, right? Fuck.**Story time**; if you'd like to make popcorn, I'll wait 'til you get back. :&gt;Right now, I work from home as a freelance web developer while I take a year off for almost failing out of university. The only reason I'm able to go back at all is because I'm not actually *stupid*, but had hitherto undiagnosed, major depression. Not to mention the wrong fucking dosage for a metabolic disorder, hypothyroidism.My boss wants me to do a report detailing what I've done for his site so far. I've spent a multitude of hours doing other things for him, building and fixing other minor projects, etc., but this current project is so... problematic that I've procrastinated more and more the deeper I got in the code. (Other webdevs and compscis will know what I mean: It's all legacy code. Horrible, bloated, legacy code and he doesn't want me to re-do it, just 'fix' it and add more features --&gt; clientsfromhell.net )At this point I am struggling with what I can put into this report. He's suggested on multiple occasions that this is taking too long, that it would be best for me to outsource to India or something, but I can't do that. It was one guy who build the damn site the first time-- took him a year and he was only paid $2000-- so it'll likely be just me ripping the thing apart before any of it will be worth refactoring, much less adding the core fucking functionality of this monster. (New features? Pfffff.)So I put it away, procrastinate, feel worse and worse about this. He's sick of how long it's taking. I'm sick of how overwhelming this has become. It's not beyond my abilities but there's so much pressure to do it that I just... can't.I get paralyzed, and then I find ways to do other things. Out of sight, out of mind. God I just wish I could throw myself off a fucking bridge but there would be no purpose to killing myself.It was the same in university! I got overwhelmed so easily and then I just... fucking basked in the self-disgust of procrastination. I'm even doing it right fucking now. Like a 'perversion of purpose', I can't help but throw myself onto a *blazing pyre of failure*. It's like an addiction to misery!**TL;DR**Don't bother, go read Wireless by Charles Stross, it's a better book by far."

        "selftext": "The aroma of agarbatti crept into each room of my parents\u2019 suburban home in Oregon. I have always considered myself a religious person\u2014a Hindu. As a child, I grew up listening to my mother sing bhajans and respecting religious holidays by fasting. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to travel to India at least a dozen times and from each visit, was able to learn more about my culture and religion.In my parents\u2019 home resides a small temple with statues and photos of the many gods and goddesses of the Hindu religion. Despite growing up as a Hindu, I cannot name more than a couple deities. I cannot tell you the significance of most Hindu holidays. I do not know the purpose of fasting. I have never seen the Mahabharata Epic. But, I do pray. When I pray, I pray to God. I don\u2019t know which one, or who, but to some higher being.The values I learned from religion were to not do anything that would upset god, or that god would not like. One of the earliest memories I have is stepping on a book. I did not mean to step on it, just an accident. My mother saw this and told me that books provide education for people and I should respect them. She told me that whenever I step on a book, I should touch it and then touch my head and say sorry to god. There is certain peace of mind that one gets when they do something wrong and then apologizes for the wrongdoing. In a sense, it makes it seem like it never happened.But what happens when one forgets or does not apologize? As a child, I remember accidently stepping on books and not being able to touch them and then touch my head. Usually it was because I was in a crowded area and was too embarrassed of people watching.  But, I would always do it, eventually. Whenever there was a delay between me stepping on a book and apologizing to god, I would turn into a state of panic. This panic, along with anxiety for to apologizing to god, would usualy take me down a path of depression. In order to avoid such scenarios, I made it priority to always listen to my obsessive thoughts. In my mind, obeying my thoughts caused me less stress than the anxiety from worrying about disobeying a higher power. It didn\u2019t matter what I was doing, in that time all I wanted to do was to relieve my anxiety about not apologizing and complete what I was told to do.This was the start of my journey, my journey as an OCD boy."
