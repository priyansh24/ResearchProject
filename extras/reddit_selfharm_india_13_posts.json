I found the entire situation very humorous for some weird reason, and I was laughing and talking to my friend about my stupidity, she told me to be careful while cleaning it up and there's that. But here's the thing, I saw the pieces of glass, got an idea and just simply....started cutting? It's been a month or so since the last time, I've never cut with glass before, probably shouldn't use this word but I was genuinely just curious. Is it a form of establishing self control...? That I can do whatever I want whenever I want? A little bit of backstory, I come from a highlyyyyyyyyy religious cultural sexist homophobic etc suburb in india, I'm not even allowed to take walks outside because I'm a \"girl\". Its something I'm used to. Anyways, has anyone else every done this? I used to regularly cut because of mental breakdowns. But that wasn't the case this time.  I'm too scared to tell my friends knowing how they'd react, I don't really know who else to go to, so. Also, I'm still not sad, I cleaned it up and I'm just sitting here chilling. Maybe a bit confused. Maybe this entire thing would hit me later and I'd break? I have no idea."

This is the limbo. I love the feeling too much to stop. My parents found out that I've been doing it and my dad cried. I feel shitty for hurting them like this. But the pain I feel inside is so excruciating and only self harming helps making it go away temporarily.I needed to be upset before to do it, now I don't really need a reason.

As passionate I am about this, I know if things go as planned, I will achieve something in life. But at times, all of it seems worthless. I feel like nothing matters at all. No matter how much I study and work hard, in the end it's not gonna matter. I'm still gonna be this lonely nerd who no one likes to be around. And I'm still gonna have this miserable feeling like I'm not worthy. And this feeling is so deeply ridden in me, that now I question myself on every decision I make. I tend to blame myself in every situation.Which just makes me feel like nothing's ever gonna change. This part of me tells me, I can't accept mediocrity from myself, hence I don't have a choice, all I can do is kill myself. I also sometimes feel like this is just the immature part of me and I shouldn't pay any attention to this. But I really someone mature to talk me through this.

        "title": "Today I cut myself in school. Here is my experience. What are your thoughts? Am I justified in being mad at the person described below?",
        "selftext": "Today is Tuesday, the nineteenth of April, 2016. Last night, my friend Kelly texted in our group chat of 7 people that her computer was not working. The screen was blue, and it said your PC needs to be repaired. She was asking for our help. One person just laughed at her problems and told her to buy a new computer. I advised her to contact the Microsoft Answer Desk, and to be very friendly to the tech support and butter them up in order for them to not charge you, by asking them about themselves and India. I speak from experience, as I was able to get Microsoft to give me free copy of Windows 10 using this method, although I did not explain that to Kelly, so her initial response I believe is somewhat understandable, because I can see how it could be interpreted as if I was just making fun of tech support and her problem. So anyway, Kelly responded angrily that we were just being sarcastic and making jokes about her problem. I told her that I was trying to help, to which she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s whatever, I\u2019m just fucking over it\u201d. I then said that I was serious and told her to not give me that attitude when i was offering legitimate advice. She never responded for the rest of the night. I could not understand why she would still be mad at me if I was trying to help. I wish that she had responded so that we could talk it out, but she did not. I had tried to help her, and she had yelled at me so I felt very sad (I would become even sadder the next day, when I tried to discuss this incident with Kelly, and she ended up just yelling at me again).Later that night, I got into bed and decided to cut myself for the first time in about two weeks. My cuts were not severe, more like scratches to be honest. I did it on my legs for the first time.I have no classes with Kelly, so the only time I see her is at lunch. So today when she came and sat down, I said, \u201cKelly, what the heck? I was just trying to help you.\u201d And she instantly got mad and said very irritably how she was not going to talk about this, that she is over it, and that she did not want an argument. First, if she did not want an argument then she should not have raised her voice. I was perfectly civil when I spoke to her. And second, just because she was over it does not mean I was also over it. As a matter of fact, Kelly\u2019s angry response towards me, when I just wanted to have a discussion about something that really bothered me, added further insult to injury. However, I kept my head, and I told her calmly and firmly that I was not trying to start an argument and that I just wanted to talk, because she had really hurt me last night. I again emphasized how all of my advice had been 100% serious. She did say sorry, but I felt as if it was insincere, as if she was just saying it to get me to be quiet. After she apologized I did not press any further, because she was quite irritated. Again, I don't understand why she would get so annoyed when all I wanted to do was talk to her about how she treated me last night. But having Kelly get mad at me once again made me very upset. I honestly felt like crying. I did not say much to her for the rest of lunch, and when it was time to go to class, she got up and left, instead of walking with all of us as she normally does.After Kelly and I finished our brief interaction, I felt awful, so I grabbed my blade (which I keep on me at all times in my backpack, although I had never used it at school before) and went to an obscure stairwell that is very rarely used by anyone. I made one cut on my arm, and then moved onto my legs. On my left thigh I made a star type drawing. On my right thigh I made about 12 cuts. The cuts on my legs were quite deep, far deeper than I had ever gone before on my arm. I think I cut so severely because I was more distraught in that moment than I had ever been before when cutting. Not to mention, being in school forced me to be quick so it is possible that I just went all out while cutting instead of just experimenting and seeing how much I feel like cutting at that particular moment, which is what I typically do. I went back to lunch after my quick session of self-harm, but did not say much to anyone. A friend asked me where I went when I returned without food from the lunch line, but I told him nowhere.If you have read this far, thank you for your time. Sorry for the long post.Regards,A Wounded Soldier"

        "selftext": "My apartment complex had a 'summer party' today. I went to see the sights and just be around people. For reasons I don't fully understand, I don't strike up conversations with strangers, ever, but I enjoy being around other people. But then I saw this one girl, one of the workers for the inflatable ~stuff~ present, her primary role: overseeing safety on the inflatable water slide.The first thing I noticed about her was that her arms were burned to a crisp. She was about as white as white people get, but her job keeps her in the sun so much that she had the skin color of someone from India. It was impressive in its own way, how adaptable our bodies are.After about 10 minutes, as she turned, I saw it. Lines. Dozens of lines on her entire bicep. I looked closer, both arms, and forearms. She wasn't just a cutter, she cut deep and often. But the wounds were all fairly subtle, only made aparent as the sunlight bounced off them just right. They were deep at the time they were made, that was obvious because of how they had healed, but they were also older.I watched her for the next few hours. She loved her co-workers, she danced to the music, she wanted little more than for someone to give her a hug (she got several, but she had to initiate all of them. I wonder if her co-workers realized what it would mean if they'd just hug her for once?). She'd get tired and sad, but then she's remember the water slide wasn't busy and she'd run down and slide on it and be back to smiling. She'd go down a different slide with a co-worker and they'd use their hats to soak each other.At one point she stepped on a twig and limped around for a bit, but I never saw blood, so I think it just hurt (she was barefoot). I should have seen if she needed anything, but...I recognize my failing and will work to correct it.For all the pain she had in her life at one point in time, she now was much happier. She loved her job. She loved her co-workers, and she didn't feel the need to hide her scars anymore. I believe she had healed from whatever held its power over her in her younger years.I never spoke to her, my observation was not overly subtle. *shrug* we all have our flaws. I left in silence as not to make her even more uneasy. But why do I write this? Well, partly because I'm so sorry I couldn't find a way to strike up a conversation with her and make sure she was ok. Partly to tell everyone here that it can get better. Finally, partly because sometimes, that creepy guy standing around just watching actually would love to give your soaking wet body a hug if he thought it'd make you happy, or get you a snowcone. I totally guessed right, by the way, she wanted blueberry (I opted for Cherry myself).Context: I had a former girlfriend who self-harmed prior to us meeting. She never talked much about it, by I knew the difference in scar tissue because she did tell me rough ages and levels of damage (we both knew biology, we knew skin layers). That is the information I used to evaluate this new person. I am an engineer IRL, hence my desire to quantify everything.I'm so sorry stranger. I wish all the best for you, and I hope that guy you're friends with either dates you, or invites you over to snuggle up and watch TV sometime. I kinda doubt her realizes just how much you love his positive energy and spirit. Shine on bright star, your past doesn't hold down your future. :)"
