Myself, am 28M from India. I am asking this question for one of my known friend who is 32F.One of my known women who is 32F, got married at the age of 22 and lost her husband after five years of marriage by the time she has 4 year old daughter. Now her daughter is of around 12 years of old (Not sure exact age). Since couple of years she is suffering from depression. and also she consulted doctor as well. But she says she feels head ache most of the time. I observed she always in  busy thinking of something, can you call that as overthinking? She says she is worried of her daughter future and career. I know, how depression feels like, i was also depressed at some point of my life in past and overcame by consulting doctors and social media platform friends like reddit. But, she is mostly illiterate, so she cannot be on social media and find the solution from the people out here.At some point, i just wonder is she depressed because she is lonely in her life and missing partner in her life. Is it because she deprived from her sex life ( I am sure she never had her sex in last 5 to 8 years approximately). She is in the condition and in such place that she is monitored by her by family members 24 hours of her day. Having relationship with any men out there is out of her choice and can never be possible. Please leave your comment below, so that how can i help her.

Even if even a single person here benefits from the methods listed, I will consider my efforts are not gone in waste. If you or your near ones are struggling with depression please read this post till end and suggest them the methods I have shared, you might save someone precious to you. So friends, In December of year 2018, one of my best friends who returned from a vacation and was staying in hotel called me around 1 AM in the morning. He consumed alcohol that night and then consumed medicines for fever and he was almost collapsed. I immediately reached his hotel with my brother, put him in my car in unconscious state and rushed to the nearest hospital. Doctors told me he's having heart-attack, did what they could best but couldn't save him.He died right in front of me, my best friend died and I couldn't do anything, didn't drop a single tear that night.Subsequent few months, every night I would get nightmare of what happened that night. Every night whatever happened to my friend would roll over in front of my eyes like a movie,  gradually I started blaming myself of not saving him. Before this incident I would almost sleep immediately after falling on bed but now things were opposite.It continued for few months, and suddenly one day I felt wires in my brain are all mixing up, I would stare at a single object for hours, didn't have any attention on anything and was having suicidal tendencies. Things got worse and I was feeling I am turning mad, I felt I am unable to breathe properly, started getting palpations, my heart would at times pound so fast I could hear it clearly. Blood pressure level and pulses readings suddenly would go very low. I knew something is happening to me. If any of you guys experienced these symptoms you know what I mean and how painful they are. I took medical help, had a few checkups and docs concluded I'm in depression. The only cure modern science offers is to give anti-depressants. Deep inside I knew taking these pills is not the remedy, it will shut the mind and make me sleep and make me more dull, when I would wake up next morning same routine will follow. I decided not to take those anti-depressants.So what's the solution, how did I overcame this... Guys what I am going to describe worked like magic to me.In year 2015, I had done Art of Living foundation's **\"Happiness Program\"**, Its a 3-4 days 2 hrs./day program, where they teach you a technique called \"**Sudarshan Kriya\"**. Its a very very powerful breathing technique which is immensely helpful in keeping the stress hormones out of your system. Once you learn the the Kriya, you have to do it every day, takes around 30 minutes and makes you physically, mentally and spiritually uplifted. Well I learned Sudarshan Kriya and was very happy with it, but due to busy schedule and corporate life, stopped doing it completely after few months. I thought maybe Sudarshan Kriya can help me but It was almost 3.5 years and I completely forgot how to do it. I contacted an Art of Living teachers and again learnt it, started doing it and believe me from day one it did wonders. I felt like I control my mind, things started improving. My Art of Living teacher suggested me to do the next level of program that's called **\"Advance Meditation Program\"**. Its a 4 days program where they teach yoga and meditations.Next week, I took that course and believe me that gave me the actual relief. Few weeks passed and things started improving automatically, sleep got much much better. Now I hardly get memories of that incidence. The series of meditations they teach at the course help you erase past impressions and your mind becomes like an empty slate. Friends, words are less to describe the \"Advance Meditation Program\" and its effects, it works like a magic.I know all this would sound like foolish, don't trust me but read about the research done on Sudarshan Kriya and its effects and you would have some idea how powerful it is. I wish every one fighting the depression to learn the Sudarshan Kriya and do the Advance Meditations Program. After COVID-19, for the benefit of society, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar has blessed these to be taken online so you can do it courses  also.**You can find the details on courses here:** [**https://www.artofliving.org/in-en**](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en)If you have done the courses and it helped you, please share your experiences here for the benefit of society.Stay happy, stay blessed, lets meditate.**Jai Gurudev....**", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1611711946.0, "author": "SiRex750", "title": "I didn't want to move... and now I want to kill myself.", "selftext": "In the last few months of my elementary school in the US, my parents suddenly told me that we were going to move to India. For a 10-year-old, I was kind of OK with it, I didn't think I would lose out on a lot. But I did. When I was in elementary, I had grades that were above 98%, I was in the accelerated studies and the school was thinking I could skip a grade if I worked harder. I even had a group of 8 tight-knit friends that were always with me. I also had a lot of hobbies like painting, robotics and swimming. Life was much simpler and easy back then. However, when I moved, I didn't get a break before I started school in India. It's because school starts on June 1, so I had no time to get used to the new place. After a year, I realized that there was a serious dip in my life. I was now barely passing my studies, I had 1 or 2 somewhat friends. I couldn't get the same feeling for doing the things I used to once love. And my dad was still behind in the US because of his job.  When I told my parents about this, they told me that it was my problem and that if I had stayed there it would have been the same. I started to get more and more anti-social. I couldn't urge myself to start a conversation with others, even though I had been a great public speaker before. I finally found something to cope with and it was gaming. Unfortunately, coming from an Asian family, they hated it when I gamed. They deleted all my games and when 2020 rolled over, I felt like my life hit rock-bottom. I just didn't want to live. My parents kept on scolding me for getting bad grades but I couldn't do it, even after so much studying. Now, I'm nearing the end of my high school and I don't know what to do for my future. I hate myself so much that I made a plan when I am going to kill myself. The plan is for me to spend the last 2 years studying the hell out for my final exams and once I finish it, I'm going to commit suicide. If I were to tell my 9-year-old self that this was going to be the rest of my childhood, I would have told myself that this was a stupid thought that would never happen.

Sometimes I play the guitar, but I'm not good at it, and I've been playing the same crap over and over again.

One day one of my  friend met with accident. I couldn't handle that. And I had not slept for 5 days even after taking tablets ( prescribed by my doctor).

So i am 15, and i am in not a very good spot. I just want my life to be better, but it just spirals down 10 times for every time it gets better. so i wont really care about the grammar etc on this post as i am currently in a post breakdown mood i guess? idk im not about to bother with punctuations and capitalizations. Also this is a long post pls read i need help. The grammar isnt bad its just the punctuations and stuff lol.I have a mom, dad and an older brother who is 21. I live in India. Although our household isnt really indian, but a lot of things would be uncommon elsewhere i guess. So anyway, since i was really young, my brother would beat me a lot, not exactly in an angry way, but he would basically choke me, beat me, scratch me in the name of fun, and i would just cry and do nothing i guess lol. what else was i supposed to do? He was 9 and i was like 3. But the choking began later like when i was 5 or 7 or something but yeah. My mom and dad would see this, and usually just dont care. There is more, but ill get on to that later.My dad. He is probably the best out of all the 3, but i still dislike him, like, i would be sad if he died, but mostly cause of money and stuff ngl. But even if money wasnt an issue, i would still be sort of sad. But yeah. He has an addiction to tobacco, not smoking, but the one where you chew and spit it out idk im not well versed in this area. He is mostly problematic, because he just doesnt care, he used to, but now he doesnt. He just screams when there is an issue and goes back.My mom. She is an actual piece of shit. I dislike her the most. She is so hypocritical, so abusive, i dont even wanna talk about it. She is the one who teaches me, and i would get good marks. Ok ill get onto the main deal now that the characters have been set lol.I was born with a dark skin tone, and i was ugly. I mean, i still am lol. I dont remember much of my life before i was 4, and i dont remember much about my life till like 6, but i still rmember it somewhat. So, i was made fun of for my skin colour, not as a racist way, but i was called black insultingly in hindi as a way of teasing. I was called ugly, and i became pretty self aware at a very young age. My method to deal with this? To act like i dont care about my looks at all. Whereas in reality, i did. I knew from a young age that my looks were a bad first impression, and i could do nothing about it. This isnt even my greatest problem, but might as well start here. Ok, so second thing. I am really emotionally sensitive. now this is not really a thing i can explain properly, like, i wont get mad if a guy on the internet calls me stupid, its moreso when a friend does, or someone i care about, and when its front of some people and they laugh or something. So from a young age, i was made fun of for my skin colour, i would cry, i was made fun of for being a crybaby, i cried(lol). Then, eventually shit happens, and i wasnt sensitive enough to cry everytime, but i would cry over emotional things still. And that is still present.This is mostly everything that has led to my ruin, oh wait, more things lol.I \\*think\\* I have anxiety, i sweat whenever my teacher calls on me, no matter how much i know the teacher. And i also have a sweating problem lol but that doesnt really matter. But my heart beats faster, i get really nervous etc. Same thing when im talking to someone popular or someone i had never talked to etc. Its just not good. Also i have this thing, where i think, like, a lot. I literally fall deep into random thoughts jumping from one topic to another with a very weak link between them. I also talk to myself, talk about shit as though if i were a youtuber or something. This might be ADHD but idk. ok so that should be everything but i might add more info as i go alongHopefully, that covers all the prerequisites to understand my situation and make a based judgement.So, i was born in 2005. I have basically no memories up until 3 so skip. So, what i can remember is, my brother would beat me, my mom was very strict, she would beat me if i lost an eraser or a pencil, she would beat me if i was late, even by a minute for studying( I study according to a time table), and for various other tiny things. She would also beat me when i got hurt while playing, which is just..... ok. My mom was a sorta teacher, has a degree in maths. She takes tuitions at home, like extra stuff to help students.( and im ngl she is good at it even though her morals are pretty messed up). Ok so my dad was pretty nice back then, he was nice, would protect me from my mom, my brother and would basically give into buying what i wanted most of the times. As i grew older, the situation changed of course. My brother started doing more crazy shit, like choking and stuff, my mom and dad started caring less and less. My brother was hella smart about it. There would basically be no scratch marks or any sort of visible signs of injury. Whereas while trying to escape, i would scratch him a lot and whenever i would complain, he would scream about that. He has a liking for power. My mom knows that he beat me, but would think that i did pretty much worse to him, and i would get beat. OH FUCK, i remember! Up until i was like 11, my mom would beat me when we i screamed for help while fighting. Bruh. But yeah a lot of her actions didnt make sense whatsoever. My dad was the same as he was up until i was like 11 or 12 i dont quite remember but yeah. I diagnosed myself with depression (lol) as i was sad all the time, at like 10 maybe? and the online quizzes seemed to prove it although they were pretty fking generic ngl. So yeah. As i entered into my double digits age, i found myself being worse day by day. But before i continue, here is another factor! lol life isnt that linear i just have to say all of this if i want help lol.So, my mom taught me. In jr kg(Kindergarten) i got like 60 or 70 percent or something. oh yeah btw we measure in percent and not grades so keep that in mind. In sr kg i got like 85, and in 1st standard i got 90. Also grade=standard. Those numbers kept going up until 4th, where i peaked with 99 in my second to last exam then went to 96 for my finals.. From 5th standard they sorta floated at 92-93 for a while. In 7th, for the first time in a while, I got 89. I got below 90. I was devastated and my parents, obviously judging me only based on my marks, scolded me. Then in 8th.... oh boy...... i really dont want to talk about this year. The shit i did in school was deplorable to say the lease. But this is about my parents so i think i can safely avoid it. If you are curious, just... dont. Its not something like murder lol. its legal but its embarrassing as hell. But, in 8th i dropped below 90 pretty permanently, and i got a grand total of 79 percent which was just sad. I then went up back to 89.8 in 9th and now im in 10th with 90 and 89.9 percent for my 1st and 2nd exam. So yeah, just know that, the validity of my statements are measured with my marks being an aspect.Also, after like 11 yrs old, or 6th standard, my parents dropped the beating basically. but it still happened.Ok so now, this is going to be a mess, i have laid out everything you need to know, now im bout to go all outMy mom is a piece of actual fucking dogshit. She is so fking abusive. She knows that im emotionally sensitive and takes full advantage of that. She has this look that she uses which basically makes me feel guilty as fuck. She uses it to and a bunch of other sayings, like \"do you have any shame?\" \"Why dont you go die\" \" This is why your marks have dropped\" and various other things that i cant quite translate without losing its meaning. She uses these sayings to make me study longer(its so stupid cause i wont fking study if she makes me sit for longer. Ill just look at the book and be lost in my thoughts) and to make me do shit, like bring her glasses. She uses this in petty arguements and hugely guilt trips me. I dont remember exactly whats wrong right now as my mind is blurred with my bro and my dad so yeah. But my mom is my biggest problem, ill hopefully edit that in. But i think ill get bored or somethingMy brother is also a person whom i thoroughly dislike. He beats me a lot, makes jokes and acts as a friend, but when we get into a fight, not a physical one, but one where we are just screaming, he says so many things which are just plain wrong. E.g. on new years, he wanted to order pizza. I am extremely scared of covid and i honestly just dont want to take any chances. LIke i know the chances are pretty low, but just why risk it? Why does it matter? Its just pizza. Losing convenience isnt a big deal. So we broke into a fight, and i said no lol. So he called me a scaredy cat, there are no better ways to put it. Its a lot more aggressive and shit but thats essentially what he said. He said that if i grow up like this and go to a hostel in college, i will be bullied hard( which imma be honest, i am very well aware of it. I just cant do anything about it like, what can i do about anxiety and social awkwardness if there is no one to help me?) But it had nothing to do with this, like, I was scared of a fucking life taking virus, and just because you want some pizza doesnt mean ill risk my life, no matter how small the chances. I know its slim, but i honestly wish it wasnt like this. If he ordered pizza and only he got the virus, i would be glad to let him. But obviously itll spread to me, thats what i care about. And then, my mom said that a person who is very close to us(not to me. I literally have no one i care about. Maybe my 2 best friends but not even that much) is gonna come back to our city, as she had married and now lived in a different state. And there is actually just no excuse for that. You cannot tell me that a person who fucking travelled through 5 states or so in a train (check out indian trains lol. They are hella crowded) is safe. He wants to look cool and say a lot of dialogues, so he said \" She will come here no matter what\". I lost my shit. I started beating him, he beat me, we went toe to toe until we just stopped after like 10 seconds. He screamed at me, as i was literally not able to talk because i was gasping so much while talking, which happens pretty often, and he got a few statements about me being a piece of garbage and so on. Then today, ah yes, the fateful day. So, he has had the laptop 24/7 for a year now, and i could only take while he was asleep, and had to give it back to him whenever he woke up. Because he was 'studying'. which tbf he was, but not all the time. He was only studying 50 percent of the time. He jus watched videos in the meantime, which he could have done on his phone(which was also mine which he took because he broke his but, i dont rlly care about it since i just watched youtube on my mom or dads phone instead). He would literally wake up while i was taking the laptop, just so that i couldnt take it. I remember i took it for my classes because he was asleep, he literally saw me taking it, woke up, and took it back. Then later when i saw the history he was fking watching videos. That made me mad. Just know that i cried for a lot of these incidents lol. So, today, his studying is over, he was watching videos on his laptop, and i wanted it, because now he isnt 'studying'. And you know what happens? Ok ive started crying now lol. But yeah lets get on to the incident which sparked me to write this. I knoked on the door. He didnt answer. I knocked again and again and he refused to open. I started crying. My mom was telling him to give it to me. He didnt open the door. After like 5 mins of aggressive knocking he opens the door. He stands there looking dominant and says \"what?\". i ask for the laptop and he refuses. I burst in and just try to take it. He pushes me around. I struggle back. I take it in my hand. He threatens me. I refuse to keep it down. He then says such shit that im on the verge of going back in his room rn and stabbing him. See the thing is, Im not mad because he didnt give me the laptop. I mean i am, but that isnt what makes me cry so much. Its his lies. He says he was studying for a while, and he was just watching videos for like half an hour.(of course, he didnt have that book there 15 mins ago when i checked, and he shut the lights and closed the door 10 mins ago.) I dont care. I just wanted to kill him and myself. I ask him, why he didnt open the door then? his answer? \"Why am i obliged to answer you?\" Not even in our language but in english. Pissed me off so much. \"why am i obliged to answer you?\" huh? Im not a brother, im not a family member, just some random guy knocking on the door right? im not someone who said 15 mins ago that i will take the laptop in 15 mins huh? I wasnt the guy who didnt cry for the laptop for a whole year huh? And you know what he else he says during this shit? \" I just wanted to watch some videos for half an hour and then i would go to sleep. \"Couldnt you just wait? Didnt i wait for you when you had the laptop?\" OH WHAT A NOBLE FUCKING DEED YOU DID YOU AABSOLUETE PIECE OF HUMAN SCUM. YOU WAITED FOR 15 MINS ONCE WHEN YOU DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO STUDY FOR ME TO FINISH MY GAME OH WHAT A NOBLE KING YOU ARE! HOW STUPID AM I TO NOT WAIT HALF AN HOUR FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR VIDEOS WHICH YOU COULD WATCH ON YOUR FUCKING PHONE RiGHT????? alright now that i ranted, let me break down what is wrong with the statement. First off, it was videos which he could watch on his phone. He has taken the laptop from me for this exact reason. Second off, he has given me the laptop for an extra 15 mins like thrice maybe. Third off, he has scolded me for making him wait. Fourth off, he wasnt opening the fucking door. How would i know that he was watching only for 30 mins? Do you know something worse? he did this just for show. Just to seem right in frony of me and my parents. He was laughing when i was screaming at him to open the door. He was laughing up until he opened the door. OK then, he closed the door, i said i would beat him, he said jsut touch me, i pushed him and he almost fell, he slapped me and i almost got knocked out. My dad comes in, hears our arguement, and yknow what he does? Scold me for sleeping at 1 30 am. Wha? I have been doing that for literal fucking years. I am only 15 and I HAVE BEEN DOING GTHAT FOR YEARSSSSSS. Then i lose my shit yet again and scream, make a bunch of valid arguments which im jsut not about to write here ok? im tired bro. Then my bro chimes in and says that im making too many dialogues for my age(ah yes, my age. Just because im 15 means my feelings and opinions arent valid anymore, totally agree) Then he goes into his room and i go to my dad and tell him what actually happened. Of course he cuts me off in the middle, and brings up the sleeping late thing again( Note that i was crying so hard that i was gasping every single time i said a word). I make an analogy to his tobacco addiction he gets mad. He asks rhetorically \" whats your age?\" . I literally(no like literally) threw my hands in the air and was about to go. He didnt let me, i said a bit more, my bro came in, and i was like \"of course now this guy will come in this argumnet, support my parents and make me have a bad time\". He then says go and take the laptop cause it was better than listening to you. OK. I took it. And here i am. Writing a reddit post instead of playing games. I wanna die. Help me. my brother isnt even my problem here man, its my mom. I just dont want to expend my energy on writing. Im tireddd. I might edit it in if it gets enough traction. Ill also post this on depression and depression help. If, like, i get 1 reply only, and that reply is like \" Idk man, go see a therapist\" i stg. ok. thats about it. ill play minecraft because i only have 30 mins of play time as i spent 1 and a half hour writing this post wooooooooooooooooooooo", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1609963583.0, "author": "thr0w4w4y_0_", "title": "Killing myself without hurting others?", "selftext": "I'm 25 years old. Have been with a gorgeous, wonderful loving girlfriend for 8 years. Have a family that's proud of me. Started a company with a friend and am making more money than would be reasonable at my age. I have accomplished multiple life goals I had. And since the world would be better without me, I am considering suicide. Feel free to skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you don't feel like hearing my story.I went to get psychiatric help not too long ago for anxiety. After being diagnosed with depression and redirected to the psychologist, I started going through therapy to understand the origin of my emotions. Essentially I'm a piece of shit manipulator. Grew up without a dad. My mom always knew how to make everyone do what she wanted, playing with their emotions and guilt, and I hated her for it. Now I see I'm probably worse.When I met my girlfriend she was dating another guy. She was really in love. But I wanted her, so I became her friend, got close, got her to break up with him and started dating her. Not once I considered anything I did wrong. She lost her parents recently and after a few days of being torn down, I was already tired of hearing her cry. It just bored me. I supported and comforted her, but I was screaming inside \"when will you get over it?!\". I now realize... She deserves someone better. And won't find him while she is with me. I'm now living with my GF and her sister. I started feeling attracted to her sister since we moved together. Became a close friend of hers and started flirting with her. She started flirting back, looked like she felt guilty, and suddenly stopped. I snooped through her phone and found out she is now dating some guy. From what I found out, it's a responsible, cute guy with a good job who is genuinely in love with her. When I found out I just wanted to beat the shit out of him. He is just who she deserves though. Maybe if he'd been a piece of shit I wouldn't have felt so bad... Oh, and he actually cried with her when her parents died even though he didn't even know them! Husband material! I have lots of friends, constantly reaching out to me. I ignore them most of the time. They seem to all care for me and think highly of me. They all trust me and rely on me. They shouldn't. I've now noticed how I discard people when they become useless to me. When I left uni, I stopped caring about the friends I made there except for when finding a partner for my business. Thinking about them just tires me out...And finally my family. I hate my mom for who she was with me, but mostly because I think I'm like her now. Probably worse. At least she loved her children in her own way. My brothers... Uni dropouts. One had drug problems, he needed my help with that and opened up only to me about his depression that led him to it. Fucking wimp. The other one I barely hear of anymore. He's just stupid. I realize now that I'm a parasite and a terrible person. I haven't disclosed all of this with my therapist and honestly don't plan to. I use people to my own benefit and discard them when they are not useful, all while putting up this stupid facade that I'm kind hearted and caring to make them love me and do what I want. I only ever cared about myself, and now that I see myself for who I am, I hate myself more than anyone. Everything is going great in my life and I can't love anyone or be fucking happy, just get a shot of adrenaline whenever I get something I want. After all I've done, I'd at least like to go out without causing more hurt. I thought I'd make my gf think I cheated on her or something (which would hurt her, but it'd make her lose her attachement for me). Then I'd write a letter saying I'm tired of this materialistic world and myself, and that I need to find myself spiritually. I'd buy a plane ticket to some spiritual country like India with my conjoined account with my gf, that she rarely checks, to consolidate the evidence. I'd say in the letter to sell my stuff (car and expensive things). Finally, I'd just pack a bag with 2 weeks worth of clothing for evidence, throw it in a clothing collection point for poor people and jump off a bridge a few hundred miles from here. This wouldn't allow me to donate my organs but would at least not bring the \"what did i do wrong?\" questions to those who loved me. Also I can't do a few of these things during COVID, but it makes more sense to me than jumping off a building or shooting myself. I'd only do that if no one cared about me... I wish that was the case now. It'd be easier. I've played with the idea for a while and think I may carry it out when I can. The world will be better off. Shit, I get a rush each time I think how smart I am for thinking about every detail like this. I really have no hope. The last views I'd have from the bridge would be awesome. I guess I just wanted to proof check my ideas here to see if there's any hole in my reasoning.

Not academically, in sports, socialising, talking to girls or anything tech related. I've never had any friends in my life and I used to sit alone at my bench in school as well, it was agonizing just watching teachers come and go and judge me because I'm the depressed and dead looking kid. They oozed hate upon seeing me. Hence I'm thankful for this pandemic.Never step foot outside my house for anything, I can stay in my room all day alone and be fine with it, that's just a normal day. Loneliness has become a forced lifestyle.Okay so, I've spent the last year battling suicidal thoughts and depression, I'm in a better place now than I was for years and I'm making progress. I've become more open to my flaws and I've spent the past month trying to get in a mindset to fix them.But there is too much I can't fix and can't accept for eg. My dead eyes, my dumb self, and extremely distant personality. This has caused me to have a seperate personality, which rejects the weaker one by enforcing superiority. It's hard to explain but to summarise my life has become a cat and mouse chase, as I go through my tasks and try to enhance my lifestyle bit by bit everyday I realise more and more how much of a useless existence I am and withing a short time the other persona takes over and tells me that I'm second to none and that everything is alright when it's really not.The persona doesn't act as a positive force in my life it just acts as a coping mechanism so I don't fall to depression and suicidal thoughts yet again. It's similiar to how one doesn't remove the blade from the stabbed part so the blood doesn't drain out the person causing him to die faster.I'm trying to look for a solution but as I mentioned I have NO ONE. I mean it when I say that I'm truly alone. There's not one person I can talk to about the years of anguish and pain that I've been holding in for years now. My family would just be anxious for me and tell me to move on, or they won't even care enough (believe me this has happened).I wanna get better and I don't want my darkness to be the death of me but I cannot drain if till I cross paths with someone who understands and who can help me by showing me the way or just being there at least.

She didn't bothered to even let me know that she's breaking up, she just blocked me and few weeks later a friend sent me a picture of her holding hands with a school friend of mine (that she had posted on Facebook). I talked to the friend(and mutual friends) to confirm things. It was painful, I felt physical pain when I saw the pictures. I shared things with my mother and it got little easier(later I found out she completely misunderstood everything). Then I got depressed.3. My Higher Secondary exams were within few months. I was depressed, I had no one to talk to, I couldn't focus, I skipped classes, I skipped mock tests. I scored very bad in Higher Secondary exams and other entrance.

I have a government job (people in India will actually be able to tell you how awesome that is) and I quickly attained promotions.

As a kid I was a quick learner and I was book smart. As I grew up, I just start getting dumber and dumber, I feel. Lots of childhood trauma. Manipulative parents. Father physically abused us regularly. We used to dread Sundays because he would be home and he would find a silly excuse to pick a fight with my mother. He would just beat her senseless. I distinctly remember one day where my mother had to go to work with a purple bruise on her face. My mom suffered so much for us, yet over the years, she has quietly manipulated my sister and I. I am not ungrateful. I would quite literally lay my life for my mom but I noticed her manipulative nature very late in life. Fast forward to my 20s and I bagged a government job and I quickly attained promotions. I attribute that to luck. Because I know I didn't work much for the promotions. I know deep down inside. Now I am the head of the branch and I just feel like a fraud. I feel useless too because I am not street smart enough to counter all the lame excuses that these people make to get out of work.

Yes . Was it good ? hell to say the atleast . I met a Girl , let's pretend her name is Alice , Alice is your typical cute , sweet , smart and out of your league kind of girl , but being kid I was I still wanted to talk to her , impress her and gain her attention , almost like Clout . well we hit it off we started to talk and stuff , fast forward to 2018 ,it's January and I know Alice very well , and things start to change , I start to see her in a different way... It was a crush ... and I decided to act on it , so one faithful day I told her that I liked her on the bus ( we shared the bus and class ) . Her response was nothing , no reply , I went home thinking had I fucked up ? did I make her uncomfortable ? I didn't know what to do .... for some reason I thought guys talking about their feelings for her would make her scared .. boy was I wrong , turns out she already had a boyfriend  , guess who ? turns out he's one of my bestfriend .. let's call him Chad , Chad here who is still currently my bestfriend , I have known him for almost 6 years now , I didn't expect this from him considering He just fucked the \" BRO CODE \" , I had told him \"Hey man , I kinda have a crush on Alice , will you help me out \" , turns out the cunt was helping Himself , Can't say I blame him , If you had the chance to date the hottest girl in your school with no strings or tricks attached , would you do it ... so I was broken I didn't know what to say , my own bestfriend had shafted me and I chose to keep quite .. through all this shitstorm I continued to talk , despite it killing me inside knowing I was \" never good enough for her and not to her liking \" ...

I died in 2018 my body just living on with my memories , I'm just the Husk of the person I used be , The best part I had no one to speak , to vent , fuck I couldn't even cry in own goddamm room , This spiral of Hell lead to one place \" Sucide \" , found a cool place to do it , thought If I'm dying might as well jump off a Building and get a good view before it all goes black.... but then if I wasn't such a pussy i would have died that day , but as soon I had reached the terrace of the Building , I start to remember the people close to me , My mom , My dad , what would happened to them? I didn't want them to think they were bad parents , I didn't want to waste their money on educating , feeding and providing me a good home ...I didn't want them to think they were a burden to me ... so I stepped off , unfortunately those memories , those demons never left , now in 2020 , it's only gotten worse by the age of 15 ,I done weed , vape and probably smoked 25 cigerettes which you might think is \" ehhh not too bad \" , I live in a Backward Country  , people younger than me have substance abuse ...

Tried Tinder/Okcupid/Instagram - still alone and lonely + started working from home - my mental health is getting worse - long post", "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I need to share something... **About me:**I'm turning 29 at the beginning of 2021. I've moved to UK for studies and for a better life, so I'm not planning to go back to my home country. English is also not my native language. I'm working in a large global company making above 3000£ per month which I think is quite good for someone of my age. I am 6 feet tall, fit - working out regularly for years around 3 times a week. So I'd say I am relatively good looking, educated and have a good income. **My story:**For the past 4 years I live alone. I am staying in a house share, but never met anyone here with whom I could get along with mostly because these were people who had came to London temporarily for work and left after few months + most of them were much older. So it was fine to chit-chat in the kitchen sometimes but that's it. At my company I am working only with males (mostly in their late 30 or 40+, it is very rare to see a women of my age in my office(floor), so I have never had a chance to meet any girl at work. I always thought that at a company like mine in London I will be able to meet with someone but unfortunately I was wrong. After 3 years I still have a contact with same age group of people who are mostly married and with kids and now  WFH kicked in as well. I'd like to meet someone who is similar in terms of career goals and education level.**My dates:**Since I felt lonely I stared using dating apps. It's a pain... but I managed to date few girls. First one was a nurse, she was okay but what was weird; she was carrying everywhere her best gay friend, and she was mentioning him very often(i have no problem with gays), once we were on a date (maybe only  I thought I am on a date?) and that guy just joined out of nowhere at our meeting, so awkward... all in all... it didn't last long.Another one was a student from Asia. I really like her, she came to do MBA, she was educated and intelligent, overconfident but she also had two faces... that other one was drinking and all that stuff. She had a lot of alcohol and weed at her place. Every weekend she was getting drunk, smoke, going to a night club etc. for me it was a bit too much but anyway I had a chance to date someone whom I was into. It was fun but one night she was doing a birthday party so she invited her friends and me as well but she asked me to pretend we are not dating (we were for few months already) and I am just friend, it was soo weird and I didnt feel good about it. We all got drunk that evening.. she didn't want me to be close to her or even dance with me, so I was just on a side... and her other drunk friend somehow came to me and started kissing me... and without more details that how this relation finished. I met also with some other girls from Thailand and Brazil but it didn't work long term cause they were not speaking english well and we didn't have much common topics to talk about + they were not exactly what I am looking for but still it was nice to be with someone around for some time. **My online dates:**I also had few online girls which were lonely like me and were looking for someone on the internet. Just not to make this post too long I'll briefly say that they were from asia. With first one i talked around a year but she end up finding someone else in UK and got married(guy in his late 30).Another one I knew for almost 2 years, we met twice in India but at the end she told me that her parents forced her into arranged marriage, so it would be a huge disgrace for her family if she would call that off.  It hurt me for a long time cause we knew each other really well. We were talking daily. 4 months before her marriage we were on holiday together and slept together. She told me that if I'd tell her earlier that we may be together then maybe it could work. The third one was also from India but she found me on Tinder in London. I think she is even in worse situation than me cause she used to date a lot of foreigners in her country but she end up being alone and now she would like to start a family and have a kid but she has no one - we just stopped talking but again it was good for me to have someone I could talk to.Currently I am doing similar thing as above with another girl from Asia who has found me on instagram. She works in similar field as me, so there is always something to talk about and we understand each other quite well. We can't meet because of covid and she also used to date bunch of guys there but anyway... I feel I am wasting time as in the cases above and at the end of the day I'll just waste a lot of time talking with her.**Covid times:**Now during pandemic I try online dating again but it doesn't work really, got some matches here and there but I don't really like my matches. I found few girls on Instagram which I like but I am not sure if I could actually go on a date with someone whom I found on Instagram?I think scrolling dating apps and instagram looking for someone I could match with had negative impact on my mental health cause very often I feel disappointment, saddens, rejection. Unfortunately, I also developed a habit of masturbation which is sometimes few times a day if I am off work and I spend too much time on those apps.  I haven't slept with any girl for more than a year now and I feel like I am also missing that but I don't want to have sex with any random girl, I need to feel that connection with that person otherwise it is better to jerk off alone and move on with life. My other problem is 'Work From Home'. My company does not allow anyone come back to the office till April at least. I am only renting a single room so it is a madness sometimes. It feels like being in prison. I work from this place, I eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. I spend my weekends here... madness... before at least I could go to the office, meet people from work, go for a lunch together, drinks or some social activities after work... now it's no longer available and will not be for a long time. Since I live 30 min from central London, I was thinking that maybe renting a whole flat in central London would give me more opportunities to meet new people? Currently I am living in quiet area full of families with kids and pensioners not much is really happening locally.**My main issues:**I'd like to find someone long term and just move on with my life and career... all that dating thing is a huge waste of time to me but on the other hand I don't want to be with someone just of sake of having someone. I don't know how am I supposed to meet someone. Office didn't work and with WFH posture will become even more difficult. I saw on reddit people advice to join some clubs... but what I am supposed to join? Ballet dance club? I joined football club and yea it was male only.  I also don't have any friends of my age here, so I never got invited anywhere. People also advised to try clubs or pubs... but I feel going alone to the pub and talking to random girls is weird, especially that my english is not perfect and I also have an accent.I'd like to keep focus on my career and further education but all those dating apps, instagram and people i meet there are distracting me but if I cut it off then I feel like something is  missing in my life, that I have noone to talk to (it is quite often that I have a days when I don't open my mouth to anyone and just talk to myself in my mind).I don't know what to do with my life now... I have a good job, money... I am a bit scary that I'll end up being 35 and will be in the same point dating-wise. I'd  like to find someone around 26yo, so that the girl doesn't have that pressure on her that she has to have a baby very soon. I am worried that it may be a case if I meet a girl in her 30.Since you already know my past... the other issue is actually talking about that to a new person which I met when she asks about my social life cause as you can see it is weird. I don't know how to change that. All that makes me feel more and more overwhelmed and depressed. There is also no one I could share that with cause people would think I am freaking out here and also I am sure that if I'd share that with someone that person wouldn't keep it in secret.What I should do now with my life? I am stuck... sometimes I feel maybe I should move to Asia where more girls would find me interesting.. I really don't know. &amp;#x200B;Thanks if you read till the end. I'll appreciate all feedback and advice.

But I for some twisted fate decided to ask her to get her parents consent. There's too much trouble here if you just run away.

Being small and wanting to complete my dream i studied studied and studied always was a bright student with good grades i had learnt abacus to increase my calculations speed and even stood all india rank 3, two times doing it. Then came the 10th got a whooping 10 cgpa. Was in the right direction to complete my dream.But you know what there were two blunders which happened1. I didn't know what was my passion or what i wanted to do or in which field i wanted to go into i didn't knew what i want to be good at from childhood i was told to study and you will be good.2. My family is not financially stable and is really conservative something like my dreams were laughed off when i told it to one of my family members she said this to me-\"Don't set you eyes too high because if you will fall down with face forward you will never be able to show your face others.\"\"You are not from a developed country like the us or uk where people get choices of what they want to do in their life and neither from a rich family you don't have choices to make because you can't become a failure in an attempt to make your dreams come true.\"And that's when all the bad things startedEven securing 10cgpa I didn't get admission in the top school due to high fees and got addmitted into a underlevel school and from there it keeps on getting worse the subjects i was taught and the exams i gave didn't showed any results because I didn't had any interest in them i used to study day and night with tears in my eyes to get good grades but never got them everytime i saw my marks on paper i cried and hoped that i will work even harder but i didn't happened and then on the report card day it showed 7.2 cgpa. I know that day i cried all day in my bathroom because i didn't wanted my parents to listen as they were doing there best to support the family. Every day i used to cry and hoped that it will get better. Tomorrow will be better day after tommorrow will be better the next day will be better but nothing changed nothing.I prayed to god what i had done wrong ?I never bullied anyone, never harassed anyone, never beated someone, never made fun of the unfortunate, never sexually harassed then why i am feeling so horrible why? Crying everyday with no one to talk it feels really bad i dont know what to say about this feeling i dont want to feel it anymore I can't see my dreams which i made as a kid i cannot go to the school because of low income of my family why? Going to a tier 3 college is not what i dreamed of and suddenly one day my little sister asked me this-Bhaiya (big brother) why have you got so serious you never laugh and smile?And then i realized that i had lost my smile over these 2 past years i dont how to say this but i was always a cheerful guy always smiling but,  but i just don't know the smile which i had has faded of and vanished i dont feel anything now its like i am physically dead the hope which i had for these 2 years that tomorrow will be better, it will get better it just happens to be an illusion i cannot tolerate this much pain now of beliving that something good will happen god will help,may be tommorrow will be a good day but it just doesn't happens. I prayed, had paitence, believed that it will get better even with tears in my red eyes whenever i cried quietly in my bath room or grabbed my pillow to not let someone here my sobbing voices.But the smile which wore two years back still hasn't come back the person which i had two years back still hasn't come back the dreams which i saw day and night still have not come back i feel horrible horrible it looks like i am worthless i am a fool to hope things i think i shouldn't had dreamed everytime i remember i burst into tears of why can't i change things why cant i ? I just want my mindset back like i used to have it 2, years before and rather than typing this with eyes full of tears i just want my smile and laughter back which i had  2 years before.

Sorry. Thanks for everyone that took time in reading.)I’m dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety lately.. I’m not able to think straight. (Self-esteem issues aswell.)Let me tell you a little bit about me.I came to the US when I was 13. I had experienced middle school for 3 months. It wasn’t a pleasant experience but it was ok, I was a social butterfly then.. I could easily talk to people.. but I felt a little awkward as they were a bit more reserved. they had their own little group going on. It was hard to fit in. Then I thought.. “maybe it me. Maybe I’m supposed to be reserved.” Fast forward to high school, 9th grade is where I was awkward as heck.. I tried making friends but I was that awkward mingling with everyone. Now that I’m typing this I realize that guys being emotional is a bad thing. I have the tendency to connect emotionally with the person I’m talking/friends with. So when ever I talk to someone for more than 15 minutes.. it gets awkward.. especially if it’s a girl.. “do you like me?” Is what I get.. and then I give them an answer saying.. “as a friend, yes.” Because I had no intentions of dating in high school. I was just too busy with school work.. and my home liked was a disaster with my controlling parents that have high expectations. I stopped trying after that, I stopped trying to talk to people or make friends. Only friends I had was from my 4 year varsity tennis activity.  My life in high school was, go to school, come home, finish homework and play video games until midnight. Now the topic video games. That was the only outlet I had to any social life. I feel like I ruined any (if I had any) social ability. I was hooked to video games until January 2020. (Schooling was great, grades were mostly A’s and B’s)My parents left for a vacation in January, which gave me time to think about myself and reflect. JAN 06 2020. That was the day I said fk it to video games and got a gym membership. I paid for 2 months of personal training.. to get me started. My personal trainer was like a father to me. I told him everything I was dealing with while trained. He really helped me with my styling and grooming choices. I lost 40lbs in the past 12 months. Built a good bit of muscle. (I was chubby before I started working out.) from the moment I started going to the gym.. I had that hunger on making myself better and ready for social connections. I started working on my insecurities.PRESENT ISSUES AND ISSUES IM FACING AND TRYING TO CONQUER.Im 21 M, 5’6, big forehead that looks like a receding hairline but... it was like that from childhood. (RACE: INDIAN.)I realize that I’ve developed social anxiety.. my palm get sweaty when I try to talk to people for the first time.. but it gets better when I talk to them more. I’m reading books about putting myself out there more. But covid so it’s hard to make social connections.Depression: the only family I though would have my back and encourage me.. my dad, mom, both side grandparents. They point out all my flaws that I can’t fix just pushing me 10 steps back when I’m working on myself. It hurts a lot. I stopped talking to my grandparents as I want nothing to do with them anymore. My grandfather was in the hospital and I talked to him once, he criticized me even when he was on that hospital and I really felt a slap to my face. (Call me Ahole but i didn’t want to deal with all the set back.) I stopped talking to him.My life is miserable. Controlled like a puppet and I’m not going to give in any longer. I stopped talking to my parents aswell.. I just come home and lock my door.. it gives me to more time and Space to wager my options.I have 2 options.1. Get a job here in the US and move out of my parents house, fall in love.. and see where it takes me.2. Be daddy’s and mommy’s b**** and move back to India to marry someone I don’t have feelings for.I personally like option 1.. let’s just say it also acts as a revenge for them always trying to point out my flaws. But I genuinely want this (not just for the sakes of revenge.)But here’s the problem where my anxiety spikes.. who’s gonna love me? I’m short! My hair isn’t that great! Let alone I’m Indian! My race has been my biggest insecurities for me. I don’t think I’m attractive enough. Due to my family.. I don’t trust people that easily.. but when I do.. I go to great lengths for them.Thanks in advance for any advice you give me.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1606961052.0, "author": "djfjxjajand", "title": "Heyyy, So I will be appearing in job interviews next year.

Sorry I am bad at writing and I tend to ramble for a while. I am a 21YO M studying Medicine (to become a doctor). I started studying Medicine in 2017 but failed the year (first year of freedom, sort of thing), so I had to repeat the year. When I had to tell my parents, both of them got annoyed and angry at me for failing a year (I received a 54% with supplementary exams but the exam cut off was 56%). My parents are from India and they still retain the mindset regarding education (everything is a competition and people look down on people who fail). I have always wanted to be away from my parents (for reasons I don't want to go into). I study in a different state (I am 2000 km away from them) and I always make an excuse to be away from them for as long as possible so I can enjoy myself before having to return to them and become someone different. For example, I purposely picked an elective subject that made me come back to university in January/February, which I enjoyed and made a few more friends (this all happened before COVID-19 lockdowns). I am always friendly and I know most people in my year by name. However, I use to have about 6 people I trust when I am going through a lot of shit and need some advice/talk to someone. When lockdowns went into effect, I went back home (as all university classes went online and my family wanted me back, against my wishes obviously). I was with family from March to June at home in Vic, before QLD was implementing new border measures for Vic. When I was down in Vic, the few things I enjoyed were driving early in the morning to pick up bread from the bakery early in the morning, driving in and out of the town, cooking and watching YT videos. Anyway, I got back into QLD with a few university mates (we called this \"Race to the Border\") 1hr and 30 mins before the new changes were being implemented. However this semester I had started consuming more alcohol than I had the years previously. When I get drunk, my depression and anxiety tend to get worse, especially with the negative self-talk. Sometimes I would just bottle them up, but when it gets worse I messaged a few of my \"trusted\" friends. During one of these episodes, one of them said I should go to the Emergency Department (this was at 1:00 am on a Saturday). The doctors told me it was good I came in and didn't self-harm (I do have a history). Anyway, another friend told me to see the uni therapist which I did and still do (as it helps a bit). However about one month ago, I was getting drunk and my depressive and anxiety episode triggered again (the first time in a month). This is when I lost 3 of my 'trusted' friends, telling me to not contact them again with a few harsh words from one of them (she was also drunk at a party she was throwing at her house). I only contacted one more of my trusted friends and she was supportive, even asking me how I was feeling the following morning. Anyway, after this, I didn't consume much alcohol as I needed to concentrate on my studies but I started bottling up my emotions again. (I do understand that the 3 people who told me to not contact them were probably doing it for themselves as it can be very draining)Today, however, I was feeling quite lonely while studying. Normally I don't feel lonely but today really hit hard which is why I just wrote out this wall of text. I have not contacted anyone as I am scared of breaking more friendships (I don't leech off people, if any of my friends asked me for anything, I would try my best to do it/help them, no matter what it is, I would still do anything for the 3 friends that told me to basically f\\*\\*k off). At the moment, I am feeling like a disappointment, worthless, pathetic and tired. After this, I will probably just sleep it off and start my day again with trying to study for the exam. Also, I have paid for 2 tickets to attend 2 'End-of-Year' events but right now, I am questioning whether I should go to them. These events are occurring on the 13th and 14th of November (after my exams finish).

My dad took him home and we decided to take care of him until he was ready to ride the world. We named him Shiva. We made him a small bed using cotton and warm clothes. In just a day he was jumping around out house but he'd barely eat/drink anything. I got a dropper for him to feed milk, he'd just drink 3-4 drops and done. He'd sit on my dad's foot and roam around the house, he sit on my shoulders while I caressed him. He was most attached to my mother, he would find warmth in my mother's palm and would always curl himself in there. I was really fun having him around. A week passed and everything was pretty fine, I searched for some articles on google about taking care if a squirrel. I used to follow all the necessary steps. But one day he seemed tired, he'd barely eat or drink, mostly sat in my mother's palm whole day while my mother trying to feed him. I searched for some more articles about his condition but couldn't get any help. We decided to take him to a vet. There's only a government veterinary hospital in our town. Basically, an old government building with just a hall containing a vet and an assistant to him. My mother and I took him there. As soon as the vet heard it was a squirrel which was sick, he looked at his assistant and both started laughing. The assistant literally said \"Kya hi bachega\" while both were still smiling.  None of them even touched Shiva and concluded that he'd die. They didn't give any prescription or any kind of treatment to the tiny life. My mother was crying on our way back to our home. I researched if a small dose of paracetamol could be given to him and found that we could. We gave him the lightest dose of paracetamol. By evening his condition worsened. He was now unable to move his limbs, his eyes looking upon my mother while she was crying with him in her palm. It was one of the most sad moments I've experienced till now. The emotional bond which was made between us and him in just a few days was strong and no one could hold their tears, my sister who lives away from home for studying was crying at her place even she didn't even meet Shiva. She had just seen his photos and videos we used to send. My father sitting on sofa, sobbing, couldn't see him in his eyes. We knew his time had come, any minute we could lose him. My mom, still crying, started to chant Mahamrityunjay Mantra hoping that he'd survive or attain Moksha. It was that moment when my mom had chanted the mantra exactly five times, his soul left his body. Our tiny little cute Shiva was no longer with us. We didn't eat or sleep that night. We just couldn't believe the fact that he was no longer with us. The next morning, we buried him in our backyard. We bid him our last goodbye. A tiny life was lost because of less facilities in hospitals in smaller towns of India. Despite being a district, it's still a town where I live. I know thousands of lives are lost everyday but when a life gets attached to you, you don't wanna lose it but when you do, either you could blame yourself or anyone involved. In our case, it was lack of facilities in our town. No private veterinary clinic in the town, the nearest is 300kms away. Not only veterinary, everyday when I open newspaper, I read news about accidents, firing, self harm, etc and in the end of the news article it's always \"Referred to so and so city\" and most of the time the victim loses his life in the travel. We don't want no public parks, we don't want no swimming pools, we don't want no fancy Gandhi squares, we just want better hospitals, doctors, nurses, compounders and everyone involved in medical department.[Shiva's Images](https://imgur.com/a/O2E0jzn)", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1603936181.0, "author": "Sruti101", "title": "I can't make a decision...", "selftext": "I've (F26 from India) been suffering the impact of what I feel is ocd, depression, social anxiety and panic a lot lately.

I'm scared the room won't be sound-proof, so anyone outside can hear the conversation. Will all my details be kept totally confidential?2. Do the doctor always prescribe medicines? I'm very uncomfortable taking medicines (have had to take so many medicines for other illness recently). Can it be only therapies or something?Please let know from your experiences.

I need this outlet.&amp;#x200B;I'm Indian and in my mid twenties, come from a fairly OK to do family, live and work in one of the major metros. Lived my entire life in Indian concrete jungles only (mom and dad moved around a lot). Financially, i do OK for myself. The money's not great but it pays the bills and i manage to save a decent chunk if it. I'm only doing this job for now cause it pays the bills. I don't think I'm depressed but just aimless and it's now driving me nuts. I know exactly why and it's quite simple: Pretty much all the stuff advertised to me as being associated with the good life doesn't appeal to me in any way: Fancy house, car, vacations, parties...... all that crap. Simply put, most aspects of life don't appeal to me. I'm not materialistic at all and only use my money for the essentials. I have no idea what to do with the rest of it. I've lost interest in everything and everyone. It's boredom rather than depression (do correct me if I'm wrong). I have nothing to aspire to. It's been that way for a couple of years now. I tend to try getting the real purpose of any venture or undertaking and it doesn't seem to get me anywhere. This has started to affect my social life. Almost everyone I come across thinks and talks about stuff that I have absolutely no interest in: career opportunities, cool stuff to buy, who partied where? who's making how much? who's dating who? Stuff that I simply don't give a shit about. I'm off mainstream social media, don't give a fuck about my LinkedIn account and have no clue what to do. Life does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I simply don't give a fuck about doing the stuff that regular people aspire to do: rise in your career, get married, raise a family, acquire a good reputation and retire rich. So I don't really see the point of living.  Though I don't have moments of extreme sadness with how my life turned out or I turned out or wishing I could have regular aspirations like everyone else,  I do feel like I'm just lying on a bed of roses watching life pass me by.&amp;#x200B;I keep fantasizing about disappearing from everyone and everything, moving somewhere far away maybe to another distant country, start living and working on a farm or in the hills or mountains or something. In a country where no one's ever gonna even think of searching for me there (if it does come down to that). My idea of the perfect life there would be to keep things extremely simple: Rise, work on the farm till the evening and then take a break for the rest of the day: watch the sunset and the scenery, do some drinking, smoke some pot and then contemplate the meaning of life until bedtime. Keep doing this with the hope that I die in my early thirties. The idea is to get away from everything and everyone and be close to nature or to simpler people and not rot in an urban shit hole where almost everyone's caught up in a dick measuring contest.&amp;#x200B;Except that I love and care too much about my family to actually do this. Plus given that I live in India where the ideas of status and reputation in society are so ingrained in you from the start, doing something like this would affect my parents reputation. Not that I give a fuck about mine.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Anyone else feel the exact same way?

I am 18 years old and my brother is 20 years old. My brother and I were from India, where we were abandoned in an orphanage and where we were neglected and malnourished. My brother is the only biological family and the only blood family that I have. We were adopted in 2006 to a white American man and a Guyanese woman. When my brother and I were being adopted, we thought that we were going to have a good life, but what we really didn't know is that the neglect would not stop. Every year and every day of both my brother and my life, we have always said thank you and have always shown gratitude towards our adopted parents for giving us a brand new life. For giving us food, for taking us on vacation, for allowing us to live in a house where we can sleep on a comfy bed, and for having a tv, etc. Our adopted mom is narcissist, toxic, and manipulative. She has physically and emotionally abused us both. I remember when we were meeting our adopted parents for the first time, before going on the plane, I had started crying; and of course, this was when I was four years old. (all four-year-olds and toddlers cry). So when I was crying my adopted mom had dragged me into the bathroom and started hitting me and threatened to hit me with a comb. Not only was that the first time my adopted mom had started hitting me but when I came to the US and started preschool, I was crying and my mom took me in the bathroom at preschool and started hitting me. My mom continuously started hitting me for the stupidest reasons. So because my brother and I were raised in an orphanage, we didn't really know much. My brother and I have never seen a dog or knew what Christmas or thanksgiving or anything was. I didn't know what a bathrobe was, so my adopted mom got mad at me and started chasing me around with a clothes hanger, beating me with it. I remember when I was in 2nd or third grade, every time my mom looked at my homework for reading or math, she would get frustrated and start hitting me over and over and over again until I understood the problem. My adopted mom continued to hit us; she started hitting us with a belt and the vacuum wire. To be honest, I did call the social service but they didn’t do any good. They said in PA we kids are allowed to be hit/beat, as long as we don’t have any scars or feel any other emotion, which is soooooo bizar. My mom continued to threaten to kick both me and my brother out of the house.Ever since My brother and I were adopted, my parents have kept our birth records and all of our adoption files hidden in their room. They had bought a special lock that you punch in some code numbers that allows you to get in. (Just like how you dial a password on your phone). I am so curious to find out about my birth parents. My parents told me that my birth parents died when I was young. My biological mother died when I was just born and my biological father also died when I was just a couple of months old and died from a heart attack. My dad decided to put a camera in his room. I honestly don’t know why when he has a locked door, which I don’t know the password to. As time flew by, my brother and I were starting to grow up to become teens to adults. My adopted parents, however, bought us both iPhones that cost $300-$600 and put restrictions, blocks, and trackers on our phones, they said that the phones were used for emergencies only. And when I mention emergency use only, I mean mom, dad, and police. I honestly don't get why they couldn’t just get cheap flip- phones that cost at least $80 or $90? Not only did my parents have a problem with not trusting me and my brother, but my parents also didn’t trust us in general, they thought that we did drugs, buy alcohol, and throw some random parties in the house even though we have never in our life have we ever done such a thing. Let me just tell you this, because I find it really messed up and really obnoxious. So when my dad accused me of throwing a party in the house I was literally laughing so hard and making so many stupid jokes. Let me tell you why. I live in PA in private development. My neighbors would call the police on each other for so many dumb reasons. So our neighbors would call the police on each other for various reasons such as someone is playing their music too loud, or someone just trespassed on to my property, or someone just targeted their gun to my house, or someone’s kid just ran away, called the child service. I would literally record the amount of times our neighbor has called the cops on each other and I would shove the video in front of someone's face to show if I would dare throw a wild party and have someone call the cops on me and have them chasing me. Not only have my parents falsely accused us of doing stuff we would never do or stalk on our phones and add restrictions and trackers, but this one just gets more messed up. So I got my driver's license in May and I have not driven since then. So Christmas finally came, and my dad bought me a car. Let me rephrase that one… (I thought my dad bought me a car and I thought he trusted me with it). But, he didn’t trust me a single bit. Every Time I was driving in the car with him, he would get so nasty with me that he would punch me and start yelling at me and treated me so badly and so mean. My dad was then Going to New York and he had accused me of stealing the car he got me for Christmas or of driving it without his permission rather than. But Never have I ever done that because I still had forgotten how to drive. So he has been hiding the car keys away from me, and he has not let me drive the car once alone. I have never driven to school on my own or to anywhere on my own. The last time I was able to drive the car on my own was when I drove to Quakertown and to the nockamixon park. But I knew that he still didn’t trust me. Not only has phones and cars and being accused of other bullcrap nonsense, but my dad started putting cameras outside the house. One camera shows the view of the walkway to the door entrance and the driveway. The other cameras show the view of the driveway and the view of the entire lawn, including the private development road. My dad has also put more cameras inside… INSIDE the house!!!! I am freaking the hell out, I mean like I am scared to take a shower, to go to the bathroom, to sleep in my room, and to get dressed. I am scared and I am freaking out, checking every single goddamn day of my life to seeing if there's a hidden camera in the bathroom or in my room. My brother was going to college and also had a good job, he then started having depression when our mother just kept saying to us about how selfish and ungrateful kids we are. She kept repeating it over and over and kept threatening to kick him out of the house. Where he was living in NY. Because my brother was experiencing so much stress, and trauma, he was smoking at a young age because your entire body technically doesn’t fully develop until you're 24 years old; especially your brain. And I am worried about my brother. The stress just kept getting worse, and my brother continued to smoke, so he decided to move out to a friend’s house and lost his job and his car he bought. I am sick and worried about my own brother now. I don’t know when I would ever get to see him and know if he is safe and healthy and if he is safe. I am only in PA because I had to finish my high school year of school, class of 2020. Even after my brother moved out, my mom continued to bring more stress but to me now. So recently, she had called me and started cursing me out and so I cursed her out and again she just kept repeating that I and my brother are the most selfish and the most ungrateful kids she has ever met in her entire life. She then told me that she wishes that she had never adopted us. So the word for word this is exactly what she said… “We saw the first picture of both of you and man I wish I had never adopted you, kids. Had I known that you both would be so selfish and ungrateful, I wish I would have never adopted you, kids. I wish I had just left you both in that horrendous place.” So since she was living in NY, she came to PA and told me that if I am not happy then I should leave. I honestly did, but I don’t know where to go because we live in the middle of nowhere where everything is like an hour or so away from you on foot. She got mad and started hitting me and told me to leave. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me. Instead, she tried to aggressively grab my clothes, like she was trying to take them off and told me that if I planned on leaving I had to go out fully naked. Because the clothes I am wearing are all hers. Because she had bought the clothes, and it belongs to her, not me. I had mentioned to my adopted mom about what she had said, about how she wishes that she had never adopted me and my brother, she then denies the fact that she did say it!!!! She said that I was making bullcrap up, even though I know for a fact she did say it. If the phone company allows you to hear people’s conversation, the day they had a conversation, and when and at what time, I would literally show proof to anyone. Not only has she threatened to kick me out of the house without any clothes on, but my adopted mom also said that she won’t support me for my college. She won’t help pay for my college. I only have two more years of nursing school, and for the rest of my nursing years, I can pay off on my own. I just want to get the hell out of here and buy my own house, my own car, my own phone, and my own computer. I just want to have my own life where I can be happy and to see my brother again. I just want my brother to be safe and healthy and for both of us to be happy and free. I don’t want to feel like a prisoner in a house. I don’t want to feel or be treated like a criminal. I want to find a job, but I am not allowed to. I found a good babysitting/nannying job that could pay me 1,000 but I wasn’t allowed to have the job. Even if I did have a job, my dad won’t take me. Also, my friends can’t take me because they all went to college. All I need is a cheap car that would drive me to work, and I need a phone that would allow me to get in contact with anyone. I am in college, just not out of state. I live in Riegelsville rd on gallows hill rd. Can anyone please give me some suggestions?

TL;DR [My mom's a really horrible person and she ruined my life]As a bit of background, I am 14yo M Indian-American, and this isn't the regular case of strict parents and impossibly high expectations, although it does make it worse. My story begins about 11 years ago. During childbirth my mother died, which left my dad in a state of panic and a desperate need of a wife of whom I could call mom and love me the same. When I was 1 they married and began a life together. When I was 3 however, my mother twisted my arm (this was in Wisconsin at the time), this broke the bone and dislocated my arm. At the time I remember her look of anger and the ambulance I was loaded into. But alas, the journey only gets worse.It was when I was 5, did the abuse really start (we moved to India at the time), and it was all because of speculation. Put simply, I was watching Tom and Jerry on the sofa, and my mom was taking a shower. Now being the relatively okay person I am I ran over to the door to close it, out of courtesy, but just as I ran over to close it out of courtesy but my mom got dressed and almost walked out of the door before seeing me. She had thought that I was trying to catch a glimpse of her in the shower through a mirror in front of the door and was furious. At first, I began to explain but apparently because I ran away from her when she showed up at the door unexpectedly I was damned. I eventually (after hours of bashing, crying, and trying to tell her that U didn't do anything wrong) admitted that did indeed do it (even though I didn't) to stop the abuse, but naive me didn't realize the consequences.  For the rest of the day,  she choked me, stepped on my stomach, hit me and bashed my head on the walls and the furniture. She also made me sit out on the balcony for the rest of the day, not giving me a bite to eat. But before my dad came home, she wiped my face and sat me down on the couch to tell my dad that nothing had happened. And before someone gets skeptical as to why the neighbors didn't call the cops, I don't really know, all I know is that child abuse isn't taken very seriously in India, and corruption and bribes run rampant through the police force (at least that was my experience). The rest of the time after that is a mix, but from family accounts, I could piece together what had happened. Apparently, my dad was horrified when he found the bruising, blood, and stomach problems and began to yell at my mom. Then came court battles of which my mom \"defended\" herself by saying my dad had physically assaulted her and managed to throw my dad in Jail for days (hence the bribery and corruption), she also threatened to go to news media with her sack of lies she called a story. Eventually, they came to an agreement (I don't know how) and decided to stick together. But afterward, the doctors realized I had a problem and was sent into the ICU because her immense abuse crushed one of my intestines, and I wasn't able to eat anything otherwise I would cough up bile. I was hungry, stitched up to an IV, and barely anybody came to visit me. But the doctors came up with a fix, and I was out and healthy.The year after, some of my relatives on my deceased mom's side began contacting my dad, to tell him that I would be safer with them away from the abuse. For a few months, this was true until they decided not to give me back to my dad and didn't allow my dad to visit. Cue the arguments and yelling. Then after a giant family argument that distanced both the relatives on my true mom's side and the \"sack of lies\" mom's side. Then after precarious arguments, a little bit of minor physical abuse and hell of a lot of verbal and mental abuse. We land to where I am today. Please know, that even though she's terrible I never harbored any resentment, as I always wanted to think of her as my mom, the person I could love, and maybe get some back. My mom's relatives are also extremely nice and I hold great respect for my aunt, grandma, and grandpa on my mom's side. But I have always tried to be the best son. My mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, which makes her in constant pain. So I clean the house, bring her food even if she doesn't as for it, remind her to take her medication, and check-in with her every single day so that she can vent whatever she's feeling. And I always try to make her feel happy, whether it's cleaning something extra, doing something so that she doesn't have to do it, or spending part of my trip to Disneyland by helping her carry her bags and making sure she isn't cold, hungry or in pain. I'm not saying that I'm the best son, I'm truly not, but I do what I can and try to minimize my . . . \"screw-upness\"?  And I never expect a reward and mostly do things and don't even take credit for it or give the credit to my sister which makes my mom and her feel happy. But it all goes unnoticed or neglectedAnd now for more than the 6 years, I have been here in California I have undergone verbal abuse beyond measure. Things along the lines of, \"You should go die, we'll all be better off, maybe we'd cry for a few days but in the end, we will be happy\" or her infamous \"I've done so much for you, I gave you a mom to love and you disrespect me like this! I gave up having another child for you!\" or the one that hurts the most: \"You killed your mom, and if she saw you today she would kill herself again\". Other than that there are the smaller hints of you're not a worthy son, you do nothing for us and we do everything for you, you are the curse upon our lives. You hurt everyone you go near, and so on.There's really not a piece of writing that I could express all her insults but you get the point. All this really starts to take a toll, I have never been allowed to express my emotions as I'm either too young to be sad and stressed out, being angry is disrespectful and crying is weak. I have been suicidal since the age of 8 and frequently cut myself. But thanks to a couple of friends, I have started to self-heal, I don't cut as much anymore and try not to cry. I sit in my room awake just wondering \"Is it so wrong to ask for a mom\", \"mom, why did you have to leave\", \"I hope dad's alright, maybe I'm just a financial drain\". But I'm telling you that even though life sucks, worry about making today at least a little bit less sucky than yesterday and soon you'll heal. I didn't write this for pity or attention, if you look, this is my first post on Reddit. If you don't believe me then that's okay, please go about your day, I really don't have the energy to argue. And if you're still reading I thank you for listening to my story, and I hope your own gets a whole lot better. If you guys want to hear more about my life just ask, writing stuff makes me happy and I'd be happy to spill my feelings. - Person who cares.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1601851747.0, "author": "Just-About-Anyone", "title": "My mom's got covid.

I will be giving you one tip on a weekly basis that you can implement in your day to day life. Also try it for at least a week or 10 days consistently to see any improvements. It may work for some and may not work for others. Tip 1 STOP TRYING TO STOP OR CONTROL YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS It is not possible to stop or control your thoughts.A lot frustration stems from trying to control your thoughts.Thoughts  come and go. Trying to control what thoughts occur when, or trying to stop certain thoughts from happening altogether, is a poor use of your time and energy.Try this Experiment-  Try NOT to think of a PINK ELEPHANT, it actually makes it more likely that you will. It’s called Ironic process theory, and refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface.What you can do or learn to do is accept that you can’t control thoughts, develop the skill of observing mind-made activity (thought production) without getting caught up in it. With consistent practice, you’ll discover for yourself that the content of your mind does not matter. What matters is how you let it affect you. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds floating across the sky: instead of getting lost in them, you can choose to watch them come and go.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1601232364.0, "author": "Broken51451me", "title": "Please Help me,", "selftext": "Hi everyone,I am a 11th standard student from India.

Nobody asks me \"how am I doing?\". My parents when in front of everyone behave with me nicely and when it comes to personal care and affection then they look towards my brother. You all might think that I am jealous of my brother, yeah that's true and this jealous has made me rebellious. I have the courage to suicide but if I suicide now then everyone will think that I took this step because of the girl with whom I am in relationship. I can't bear any more pain, I am tired. If anyone wants to talk to me on Instagram please DM on @kshitiz_psycho. I will be grateful if someone of you even ask about \"how am I doing?\".

Gradually my life has sunk into its deepest pit. Ending this life seems a hopeful event. I live in a joint family and therefore at the receiving end of utmost oppression from family and community. My parents have gaslighted me since the day I was born. My family has criticized me, controlled me, and have gradually killed the person I was supposed to be. I don't know who I am. I was raped by a family friend for 3 years, sexually harassed from the age of 9. I asked them to take me to a therapist and they denied that I am depressed and told me to 'think positive'. My father has terrorized and emotionally abused me and my mother since forever, but denies it. Everybody denies things they did, and I do not know what is the truth anymore. They tell me what to wear, what to eat, who to talk to, when to go out, when to return, how to even use the toilet. I had to ask their permission to make a phone call at night, ask them if I can even cut my hair. Issues with my parents kept reflecting in my relationships and I currently about to lose my boyfriend because I have too many issues to cope and I show him the same terrorizing, mindfucking behaviour my parents do to me. I hate myself, I hate to look at my body. My family members have compared me to my friends and called me ugly infront of them, when I was already suffering from inferiority regarding my body. I have tried to reach out to my parents, my mom, but they deny, saying that I think too much. They blame me instead. Since they control everything, using the pandemic they now do not let me go out, or bring anyone home. I am here inside the perimeters of my house for 7 continual months. I cannot sneak out because my father has threatened me that if I by any chance come back with the virus, that will destroy our family and I will be responsible if anyone dies. It's bad in India. Then they even start scolding if I go downstairs without explaining or having a valid reason. I am inside these walls and then also I am not left alone. They constantly check what I am doing. And then my graduation exams are starting in 5 days and I have literally forgotten everything and I am trying so hard to sit with my studies but after 5 minutes I just can't. Either I cannot concentrate because I am just fucking mentally exhausted or they are constantly entering the room, moving things around, talking about stuff, regardless of what I am doing.

Therapists are incredibly expensive and so hard to find. I have found one and have been talking to her for months, but something in me just doesnt trust her. It seems like I already know what ever she is talking about. I have a lot of insecurities, I always feel I am not enough and feel worthless pretty much all the time.

Working is the only thing that helps me escape from feeling numb and worthless, I have pushed myself so much into it. For months I have been pulling off 90-100 hours of work every week.

Fucked up my highschool results, but somehow got into college, I'm studying BCA now, 3rd year. I don't like to study at all. Bca doesn't interest me. Idk what interests me. I don't like codeing thats what I know. I cheat in exams. But I do my assignments on time. This is my everyday fucked up routine.. I wake up at 1pm. Have tea, game, have lunch, rest(this is when I'm writing this), Youtube/aim training/watch series (once in a bluemoon if I have assignments I do that), eat dinner, game till 5am(because my isp gives me a lot of packetloss when in the evening)/sleep. My mother is sick and I have anxiety issues. I can only talk to my mom and my girlfriend. Ahh yes, I have a girlfriend whome I don't know if I love. She loves me, that's what she says.. but I don't feel that connection anymore, but I don't feel like to leave. It's a 4 year relationship. We don't talk much.. twice a day.. for 30mins max. We always tend to not agree on stuffs and fight. She wants me to understand whatever she says, if I don't, its usual emotional drama. If I leave, my parents are involved to get our asses back together, especially my mom. She likes her. But don't get me wrong.. she's a good girl..we have only sexual connection. I don't find anything else. Anyway..I smoke a lot. A lot.. of biris. A packet in 24hours but I don't do marijuana anymore.. it's like once every month/a friend's birthday. I have tremors in both of my hands, I can't handle pressure of tournaments and pressure in general. I like building computers.. like linustechtips stuffs.. it's cool. Very interesting. Idk what to do for a living, nor I can talk to people. Like seriously. I stammer even if I go to a shop for asking a simple banana. Or to ask a price for something. I stammer hard. But I aim good. I'm in a clan.. I coach them here and there.. I tried to sell a coaching on fiver.. didn't work out. Nobody was interested on my coaching. I'm pretty good at it.. I've done my research.

I just ask you to make at least this easy in my life.)Hi,This will be a copy paste text as I may not be strong enough to share everything all over again. This is my second attempt at this. I couldn't do it the first time.Anyway, I'm suffering from depression from past 3 years. Actually, I have had several episodes throughout my childhood due to bullying in school and College. But it got worse after I graduated. My parents (mom, especially) treated me like trash because I couldn't land on a job. Really changed my perspective on everything. I felt my worth is nothing to anyone. I grew up in a poor family and my parents being the way they are, isn't their fault anyway. But all these sudden responsibilities (I have 2 younger sisters and I'm an India. So you can imagine what I mean) put over my head, is just too much. All things I wanted to achieve while I was college were vanishing right in front of me. The realisation that I'd never get to live the life I dreamt of, is really messing up my life.What's all these about? What's the point if I'm never able to achieve my dreams? Why can't I just run far away and live for myself? What's the point of living like this if I'm never going to be alright about my career or life itself? What's the point of living if I know I'm never going to be happy?I can just jump off a building or breathe nitrogen gas and never have to worry about being sad or depressed again. When I'm thinking about suicide, I'm never scared of not being happy again. But I'm always scared of getting hurt again.I request you to not ask me what my dream is our discuss a way to fulfill or achieve it. I have already discussed it a billion times to every single person I have shared about my depression. Yeah, there's a chance that I might achieve them. But it'd take me YEARS to do it. I'm not capable of hold up myself for so long. I don't want to wait for so many years. I want to be happy now. I want to not feel depressed again. I wish we were mindless creatures rather than to deal with all these emotional drama ( I wanna say emotional roller coaster but mines just a downward spiral).My job? I'm a customer service chat agent. I have done handful of jobs throughout my life (I'm 24 now), but this job is the worst. I wake up everyday worrying about what kind of customer I'd have to deal with today. I've imagined myself smashing my head on keyboard or ripping my laptop into 2 and getting electrocuted or bleed out to death from my head injury. But I never physically harmed myself.If the information is necessary: I'm a dude living in Bangalore. I'm nihilistic atheist, tryna live as long as I can deal with this meaningless life. I'm doing this cuz my close friend insisted me to try this out. I'm not saying i don't trust in therapy. I'm just saying, surrounded by so much negativity while doing THIS job, this text based therapy wouldn't be much helpful.I want to thank you and the whole team for doing all these and for free of cost.

I have been on medications since then which helped me a lot and get back on track.I can still tell those few months were hell (October 2019 till now when I have depression relapse). I am consulting a psychologist (female) and psychiatrist (male) both are quite understanding and well aware. I have absolutely no complaints from them. On the start of this year, a medical specialist wrongly diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and prescribed me medicines. After which I started consulting my psychiatrist who said that I don't have hypothyroidism and stopped the medication for thyroid. I took the medicines for 8-10 days which messed up my hormone levels. Then the psychiatrist doubted that I may have hyperthyroidism but didn't prescibe me any medicines. I had to give blood samples multiple times with an interval of 6 weeks. This time the doctor is still confused and told me to do Ultrasound.My point is that I have to consult other doctors besides psychiatrist due to many reasons.Often I have to face their judgemental looks and insensitive words when they see my past reports and medications. I am not the confrontation type of person so I say nothing. But it clearly bothers me. I understand that India is not \"educated enough about mental illness\" but being a doctor doesn't give them the right to judge me. It hurts me a lot and makes me furious.

I've tried approaching them but I've either been ghosted or messaged like a stranger. Every time, I am the person who starts the conversation. I know there's nothing wrong with that but if a person calls you their friend then it is kind of obvious that any person in that friendship can message to the other side.People who I believed and who I talked with are not able to find even a minute out of their week to message me.  Before quarantine times they declared our group of friends as 'family'.I've always been the 'funny' guy of the group, and just like in the memes as the funny guys are depicted of being depressed within their heads, the same situation exists in my life.There are about 2-3 people who I'd considered to be my bestfriends, but they proved their relationship with me as otherwise. None of them care. None.Often, when there is some kind of work or support they need, for example, an emotional support, they mention it when I've messaged them, they talk to me, and when I ask details (just to listen not even suggest any solution because I know they'll find their way out of that problem on their own, they are smart and mature enough for that) they say that its personal and I can't ask any questions about that. Some of them tell me that they love me, but I know that is to maintain the confidentiality of the content they told me about. I've tried to believe otherwise too, that maybe I'm just overthinking, but in that case their actions proves that wrong every time. I am treated as an audio diary basically. In terms of work, I do it and if they ask for it I share, and that's that no further talk.I come to realize that being resourceful and funny can be a curse, so to get rid of it I've cut myself from everybody. Since a month I haven't messaged any single one of them, I find them online on social media and successfully resist the urge to message them. I share memes but again I'm either ghosted or just message a 'haha' text or so. Those people are smart enough to understand that if I'm memeing a lot I am not feeling good and I'm searching an escape from reality, but then again the point that they just don't care about me is proved.So, I don't have any friends.As far as family goes, I have a mother who loves me but when I make the slightest of mistake she ends up supporting my physically abusive father who has been beating me up since I was 10. He says 'when you'll get to face the harsh realities of the world after you become an adult, my beatings will seem like a gesture of blessing to you, and you will thank me that I put sense into your brain.' But I genuinely think that its affecting me otherwise.I don't feel like studying anymore, but if I don't study then my father would do what he does even more because he wants a full utilization of the money he had invested in me. For him, earning money and providing it for me and my sibling is ultimate parenting, because love and social growth is the kind of thing that mothers are supposed to do.I am somewhat talented, I can learn skills on an incredibly fast pace and I have proved it many times, but I've been told by my father that my talents have no value in the world and only marks (he doesn't ever say education but marks) are the only way to success.I am smart too, my favorite subject is Math and I am good at it but as I told just now, I don't feel like studying.Because of all this, I am lazy, fat, depressed, irritated and angered all the time.All of this used to happen before COVID too, but as the conditions have become worse and so is my life.I've lost all motivation to do anything, and everything I dream of achieving is either disapproved by my father or it just seems too far fetched.Whenever I try to distract myself from depressing feelings, I try to use social media but my parents think that I'm constantly chatting with someone and they'll be a bad influence as they assume any stranger in this world to be. This is the reason I'm scared to put this post up too.I am somewhat suicidal but I'm also scared of dying, just like I'm scared of every little thing in this world. I get suicidal thoughts, but as soon as that thought comes to my mind I feel like the reason that such thoughts occur to me is just my fault and I have to deal with it somehow, even if its somebody else's fault in reality.I feel like I should just approach my grandparents (maternal side) who are financially and socially stronger who I really love a lot, more than anybody, but they also have a busy life because they have other children and grandchildren apart from my mother and me respectively. My paternal side grandparents are just an older version of my father, who want to hit me but won't because their bodies ache due to aging.I'm from India.Whatever I just told has been going on since 5-7 years. Which is about 30-40% of my lifetime until now.I can't go to a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor or any such aid because in our country millennials and boomers think that such things are only meant 'mentally disabled' people and not for 'respectable' people (even though I have no respect anywhere).

I'm from India, at university in the US. I'm doing fairly well in school, i'm fairly fit and love exercising. I also have a two 'close' university friends, a bunch of other casual ones and my old highschool friends back home. My problem? I've never been in a romantic relationship. Never. Not one girl has ever taken interest in me. Sure,  I talk to them, and a few are quite close as friends, but I've never been in an actual relationship. All of my friends are in one, and while I'm extremely happy for them and they are quite supportive of me, I feel worthless. I'm never going to be good enough. Recently my 23 year old friend proposed to his partner, and again, I'm really happy for him, but at the same time, I feel like I will never get to experience what he is. Add on to this the fact that my parents are somewhat stereotypical indians, and I don't know I will have their support or if they even want to see me get together with someone (this probably isnt true; my mom actually asked me a few times if I got a girlfriend). I know I probably sound like an edgy teen or that this issue is trivial or very common, and that things will get better. This probably isn't even real depression right? I'm sorry if I misused that word. Past few weeks, this realization and feeling of being absolutely worthless to anyone as anything but a fucking resource or means to get work done has been fucking with my head hard (this probably isn't even true, but the scenarios just keep going on in my head and this is my current mindset). I'm probably just blaming my inability to get someone on my parents. I've cried alone in my room multiple times and I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy. I'm fucking lost. Maybe its just quarantine? I know a lot of you will tell me to put myself out there, and I've already done that. Hell, I'm an active in three different clubs and in a fraternity with a ton of good guys.Just yesterday I jokingly said to myself that if I killed myself then my thoughts would stop going haywire, and only after a moment did I realize the severity of what I just said.

I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my \"beliefs\" to myself and don't tell them about it. A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents.

I didn't had toys or anything, i wasn't allowed to go outta house, even packed chips and stuff weren't allowed. I remember how my father treated my elder brother.. he used to beat him for low marks in school and many other stuff which is harder to explain. We were never taught any manners or any kinda stuff, bc my parents were busy with their work they never thought of asking their child if they're okay or not or even teaching something good. They always expected from us that we suppose to know everything. Even when my brother was suffering from stage 3 brain cancer and was in stroke paralysis my dad treated him like shit. I used to think that my dad has work pressure that's why he's abusive and all but when my brother had cancer my father was retired so i still don't know why he treated my elder brother like shit (my bro died aug 2018).

trauma is nowhere as bad as what others have gone through, it has definitely taken a toll over the years.as a kid, i was molested, bullied, abused, and my already pre-existing mental health conditions got worse. but i stuck through it, and made it to high school.high school was the darkest time of my life. i was raped and this put me in a really dark place. i was very suicidal my sophomore year. i was also being groomed by pedos, and hurt a lot by people. my eating disorder got worse, and i self harmed a lot. my physical health was also taking a toll. i still have a messed up stomach and occasional fainting spells to this day. i was on every medication in the book, and that just made everything crazy. i was home instructed most of my sophomore and junior year, and pulled everything together my senior year, somehow graduated, and then went to college. when it came to friends, i do have friends, but after high school, i wanted to distance myself as much as possible from high school. even my senior year, i kept bailing on all these people that did care about me, something i still regret.i was really optimistic about college. everyone told me it was a new beginning, and a fresh start. and, my first year, was terrible. my college orientation was terrible since for some reason, my schedule was a mess and i had to get so much shit fixed. but i was still optimistic. when i moved into my dorm, i realized one of my roommates was kinda crazy. just not someone i really vibed with, which is fine, but it started affecting my mental health when random people would come into our room at 2 am, constant drug deals happening in our room, and when she told me about her eating disorder. this triggered mine and so mine got worse. i told a mutual friend about the situation, who i thought knew about her eating disorder, and basically got into a lot of drama with my roommate. i really shouldn’t have told our mutual friend, and instead maybe an RA, but my dumbass just wasn’t thinking. while there was all this roommate drama going on, i met my now-ex. and this asshole, i swear to god. in the beginning of our relationship, when we were getting to know each other, he never respected my boundaries, but my dumbass didn’t want to say no, because i was head over heels for him. and it makes me mad. i started coming to my senses, and wanted to break it off, but then, i found out about my grandfather. my mom told me that my grandfather, who at the time lived in india, was very sick all of the sudden. i was very confused because literally before college started, he was fine. i talked to him on the phone and he was fine. also, this was around mid-october. and so i hung onto my ex because i felt like i had no one. i didn’t really make a ton of friends in the beginning because i was so stressed about pre-med and classes and stuff. the ones i did make, i kind of got out of touch with at that time, and only spent time with him. eventually i moved in with him, and i kept ignoring every red flag.my grandfather passed away late october. my parents had to go to india without me because i had exams that week, and i couldn’t even say goodbye. he passed away from cancer. this was the first close relative i lost, and it broke me. i stopped eating, i barely could go to class, i barely slept. the only person i talked to was my ex. all i did was lay in bed. i passed out during one of my labs, because i didn’t eat that whole day. it was just such a mess. a week after i found out, my ex decided to come back home drunk, and i was so worried, and stayed up until 4 am taking care of him. i remember ordering him food, going downstairs in the cold at 2 am just for him. the week after that, he allegedly cheated on me. i say allegedly because i’m not 100% sure, but essentially, i saw texts between him and some girl. that weekend was veterans day weekend, and i went home to spend sometime with my family. the one weekend i was gone, he cheated. his excuse is he felt hungover and he needed weed, and his only way to get weed was to have this girl over and smoke some of hers. i obviously didn’t believe it, but i just could not accept the fact he could cheat on me. and, i couldn’t go back to my dorm. i was too dependent on him, and i knew i had no where else to go. he knew that. we argued a lot throughout our relationship. he was a big dude too, and he was very aggressive. it was a bad situation, but i just sorta accepted it. by the time exams came around, i pulled myself together and finally went home for winter break. honestly, things got a lot better in january. i realized that friends are important, and those friends that i cut out for all these extraneous reasons (such as a toxic person that is friends with all of them) are stupid, and these people care about me. i got back in touch with my high school friends, and made more college friends. things got worse and worse with my ex. he was very emotionally manipulative. as soon as i decided to leave, he would cry and say he would not be able to live without me. just emotionally manipulative stuff like that. i also had this one friend who was just very toxic but i didn’t really realize it. she put a lot of her stresses on me, and expected me to fix them. valentine’s day came around. he didn’t do anything for me. i know that it isn’t a competition, but for his bday/christmas, i went all out and got him something special and made him something. on v-day, i had 2 exams, first one at 7:30 am and i still wrote him a little note. that’s honestly all i wanted, a letter, a note, a cute drawing. anything. but he didn’t do anything for me, and it hurt. in march, because of quarantine, i had to go home. my ex helped me move out of my dorm, since my parents at the time didn’t know i was living with him. he met my mom and dad. oh and two days later, he stole money from me. call me a dumbass, because i was very dumb for doing this, but i left my card on his phone. and i forgot he had access to it. i’ll be honest, in all my previous “relationships,” money was never an issue. he was the first guy that actually made money a factor in our relationship.initially, we were going to split everything. this guy i went out with before him would pay for everything. personally i never liked it. i was totally okay with splitting, but i chipped in more than him. he basically said that his parents weren’t giving him the money he needed. and his excuse for not having a job is that he said his parents would not let him. i know, a very dumb excuse. around november, i let him use my card whenever i didn’t want to go get groceries. that’s how he had it. over the course of a month, he stole 300 dollars. and lied about everything. i feel

goddamn best. and this is what i’m tired of. why doesn’t it get better? i feel like i’ve had it hard enough already, but there’s always something that happens. someone hurts me. someone i trust is fake. and it’s so frustrating. it’s struggle after struggle, and i don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. i don’t even know if there is one. thanks for reading guys, i know this was very long.

I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (slaves). Please help me.

On the fact that i don't value life anymore? Or  the issue on how pathetic i am?I never really understood why people would want to kill themselves before. But recently i finally understood what it feels like to be on their shoes. And that's why i feel so pathetic, and weak. Lately i thought about my life a lot, my past, present, and the hopeless future. And suddenly i found no value in life anymore! I am making this post because i want to organize my thoughts. I want to know what exactly is wrong with me. This may be a bit long but i hope you guys can finish it for me.I have never enjoyed my life as long as i remember. I came from a poor family so i never had the things i wanted since childhood. I remember myself always envying others, and i started loosing interest in hanging out with friends because of it. I also am a sole child so my loner life already began during my childhood. At grade 6, i entered a central boarding school, against my will because we deeply fear boarding schools here. But my parents want me to enter it because of the free education. The name of the institution was JNV. There was a lot of ragging there, and the second saturday of the month was always what i spend the rest of the month thinking about, it was parents visiting day. And that was the only thing i find it worth remembering from that school. I'm currently a college student, currently in my 3rd semester. I am renting a small house by myself here. The college is 10km away from my home but i often need to go there by foot because transportation is not that good here. Oh, I'm from Mizoram, a small underdeveloped state in India.I'm not particularly good at studying. I already have 3 back paper during my 1st and 2nd semester. I also am quite ugly, and have acne. i have never had a girlfriend. The fact that i am poor, and bad at socialising could also play a big factor on that. Also i genuinely am not interested in relationships.As i said. I am a pathetic person. I envy others. Most of my classmates have a motorcycle so i want one a lot too. But it's hard earning money here, as there are no part time jobs, and my family is poor so i know i will never have one. As such i don't really enjoy my college life. Provided my grade is already really bad, and looking at the bleak future, i don't even think continuing studying is worth it.I am an atheist. So i don't really believe in the afterlife. I have never valued life. I don't really care if i die, because that would just mean that i would be leaving this world a little earlier. I don't really care when people die either. These things just comes as a natural thing to me. Many people die everyday, our time will come sooner or later.My parents are christians. They already know that i turned atheist. I also know how disappointed they are on me. Our home always remained my safe haven before. But now all i get after going home is endless sermon at my face, and i still can't miss a single church day because my parents want me to attend it. And indeed i want to fulfill this little wish of theirs. But unknowingly this also became one of the reason why i don't enjoy home anymore. One of the reason could be that we always have a prayer before eating food, but they never fail to pray for me to convert back to christian. It is always extremely uncomfortable. And then i started thinking recently. I don't value my life, I don't care if i die at all. I only value my life for my parents, to live for them. I deeply love them, and i want to do something for them in this life. We are poor so i atleast want to bring some richness into my family. But now they are extremely disappointed in me, disappointed that i became an atheist, disappointed that i am so bad at my studies. And i also am disappointed in myself for letting my parents down in many ways. I just want to leave this life.I tried adding colour to my life a lot. I started playing games. Recently i played league legends and valorant. I indeed enjoy them. But it's extremely limited when you don't have anyone to play with, i have some friends mind you, but they don't really play games. It gets boring very easily. I also started watching lots of porns. I masturbate a lot. But these things don't really seem to help me much. Instead i became much more depressed realising that i am trying so hard to achieve nothing. I just want to end this pathetic life of mine thinking these things.A few days back, i ate some rat poison due to sudden impulsiveness. I immediately regret after eating it. But i ended up not caring and i went to sleep after making a short call to my parents, ofcourse i said nothing about the rat poison thing. Surprising nothing happened, my stomach didn't even hurt a bit after that. Maybe i was actually afraid of death, so i became quite spirited after realising nothing happened. And i doubt i would do something that stupid again lol. I got quite a scare there. Due to covid 19, my life is extremely boring these days. I didn't went home so i live alone in my rented house having nothing to do. To be honest i am very disappointed that my parents didn't ask me to go home. But for reasons i don't feel like going home either. Now that i typed these things out, it seems to be the accumulation of lots of things that made me lose interest in this world. I'm quite pathetic don't you think? Just because i came from a poor family, i don't have many friends, i'm ugly, i don't own a motorcycle like others, and my relationship with my parents became a bit sore, i want to stop living!! I know there are lots and lots of people out there with way worse condition than me that still tries their hardest to live! Though my logical thinking questions the purpose of such life of suffering, i suddenly feel like my life is not that bad anymore.This post actually helped me a lot. I feel like i release a lot of frustration through this post. It made me realize how pathetic i actually am! And maybe i should try a bit harder in looking for values in life.

It's been 2 years since I've known her, closely, 6 years since she was my acquaintance and been in this relationship for the last 9 months. We were best friends while i was in my 3rd relationship, she had a huge liking towards a singer who was locally famous(all three of us are from the same college), while i was her friend, she proposed and he rejected. After that I happened. She has this habit of playing with my hair when im driving (she used to do with the singer guy too), but i was conscious since I was losing my hair and was having a hairstyle so as to fill my spots. I was a bit jealous as the other guy had thick hair and wanted my balding to not cause a problem , so i started to get hair loss treatment which consisted of Rogaine and Finasteride.At the same time, I started to feel jealous about the equation which my gf had with this singer and conveyed the same. They were supposedly best friends, but their vibes threw me off. She told that she felt restricted and needed a break. After the break she came back and told me that she no longer had any feelings for him so I need not feel insecure. However, cut to a month later, I find texts stating how she misses him and How she feels that if they would've been together it would have been great. She also had a habit of saying \"I love you\" to that singer guy, which i wasn't cool , so she told thay she'd stop saying. But that day she even told him that she loves him. I confronted her, she told that it was very vague and she did not mean it at all and she loved him as a friend(whatever that means). We were already having many fights due to incompatibilities, but this broke me completely. From that day onwards, I have lost my ability to think straight, stalked her on instagram, would check if she liked or commented on the songs he posted, etc. In totality i became toxic which was'nt my trait. I was pretty outgoing and the irony was that i left my ex because i was feeling restricted. I asked her to stop talking to him as i was losing my individuality and was focusing on what she was doing, She tried to stop, but would talk to him in someway or the other. It got to a point where i would even hate her mentioning his name while texting. The last time she stopped talking to him, they talked for 4 hrs continuous when they started. I lost my shit and asked her to give me break. I had a panic attack and was about to jump off my balcony. I have totally lost my self confidence, sleep and peace of mind. Im always sad and anxious. I feel that I'm not sufficient and I cannot give her what that other guy can(he's popular and sings well). She gave me an ultimatum to either get over my insecurities or be done with the relationship.In this process of being with her, I lost all of my friends. I have no one to talk to except for reddit. Even now, I'm not able to express myself completely as I feel that it would put her in bad light. I read some articles on how Finasteride induces anxiety, depression, insomnia and a craving for sweets. All of which match with my symptoms. If I continue this way I'll be depressed and if i lose my hair I'll never be confident again. I dont know what to do, i just feel like ending my life now. I feel like there's no one who understands me. I am from India, people here would laugh at me if i tell them that I'm depressed.

So I have nowhere near the study ethic a proper indian student should have but i still get top 5 in my class for most of my classes and sometimes top 5 in my year leveel for others. But my parents or my family in India aren't happy with that. Because one of my cousins got top 4% in the country in her final year of school and another cousin got top 2% and another one got top in the state so the standards for me now set by my parents and everyone that  I know.  But the thing is I am nowhere near that and if i tried to be I'd rather kill myself than get that because I like to have something called a life other than studying. And its like I need top 20% to get into the uni and course I need so thats what I am studying for but if I get more I'll be ecstatic but if I get less than that I'll still be happy because I know I tried my hardest.   So the main thing in life for me is to be around people i love and they lock me back and I get motivation to do something when I'm around people that have back for me so when I don't see people I'm down in the dumps. So the expectations that are set, are literally pushing away at my mental health now and my relationships with people. Like I'm starting to lose friends which I never want to. My relationship with my parents is going down faster than the speed of light because they expect me to be in my room just studying for 3-4 hours on a school day and 6-7 hours on a non-school day which is just way too much for me to think about. This expectation set by my family is costing me my relationships i have with others including themselves.  Like an hour or so ago i had gotten back from work and started video calling my uncle to see what was up because he had called a couple of times but I couldn't pick up. My dad was like stop talking to people and get to studying and it's like I need some time. So 10 mins later he comes back and says why tf aren't you studying and just gives me a lecture again which gets me down in the dumps pretty quickly and i see a scissor and just think about cutting because I've literally got no one to talk to, my parents haven't even come in to see what I'm doing in the past 2 hours or even check up.   There have been cases where my dad has literally told me and i quote \"I don't respect you as my son\" when I wanted to know the reasoning behind me not being able to go without my friends in summer holidays (they are in december for me) or me getting 95% or 52/55 on a math exam and 3rd in the whole school for a math exam and him being like why didn't you get 1st or why didn't you get 100% and it's like thanks appreciating my 25+ hours of study i put in that week and 60+ hours in the 2 weeks leading up to it. (This was school assessed so it didn't matter much as my end of year exams).  My friends aren't of much help because well just say this I thought they were laughing with me but they were laughing at me so I don't really go to them and also I'll be a burden to most of them so there's that.  I've tried talking to my mum about it and shes like its your dad's fault and if I say something I'll get in trouble and she backed my dad with the i dont respect you debacle.  So any tips?

(extremely sensitive to me, and might be to others)&amp;#x200B;# Video Games/Hobbies* video games use to be my escape from this world, but now i can't even play for more than 5 mins without shutting it off. # University Part 1* Fast forward, my dad enrolls me into medical school, close to South Africa.* I was super happy, not about medical school, but the idea of making friends, or even a girlfriend.* This is where everything just went bad.# Relationships Part 1* I ended up meeting this girl in uni, and we got along quite well, we'd share everything with each other, and i started having feelings for her. I knew she was talking to another guy(long distance) at the same time ,so i tried to hold in my feelings. One day she'd \"told me that if i should stop talking to him?\" I couldn't have it in me to make her choose between me and that guy. This ended up destroying our friendship, and it still bothers me to this day, now she hates me. But i also hate me so it's okay.* After my friendship ended with her, i befriended this other girl and guy, and they were really sweet to me, We'd sit together, have lunch etc.# Heartbreak* This new girl ( lets call her Sid) btw we were just really good friends.* She was suffering with depression just like me, and we instantly connected with each other, and she'd share her pain with me, everyday i'd ask her how she is.Shit i'm sorry this hard to talk about.I'll give a timeline that i can sort of remember.October 19th 2017 It was a festival we celebrate in Indian culture called diwali. This was the day she told me she tried to kill herself, because of all the pain she felt, she opened up to me, and we spoke for hours, she cried a lot, but i finally felt like someone trusted me enough to share their deepest pain with.October 20th She called me asking her to take her back home to India, i jokingly told her, we have to get through med school together, then i'd take her back home. October 21st - Till this day, has been the hardest day of my life.* She messaged me early morning, she posted a black picture on instagram, and gave me her instagram details and asked me \"make sure nobody posts anything bad in the comments\" i was like okay i guess.* Later that day she'd message me telling me, that she was feeling cold, and i tried calling her, but she wasn't picking up.Sorry it's a bit hard to talk about.* My cousin called me 1 hour later, asking me if i knew about the girl who passed away from my class. I was in complete shock.* I tried calling her, no answer, but then i called her roommates and they told me she's fine. i felt relief but at the same time i needed answers to who had passed away.* My cousin called again 5 minutes later, telling me Sid from my class had passed away. Her roommates fucking lied to me.I completely broke inside, cried so hard, i didn't know what to do, i was contemplating jumping of the building, I kept asking my self if i could of done something, I still blame myself everyday, that i could of done more, if i could of seen the signs earlier, i could of done more. She still shows up in my dreams.# Relationships Part 2* After a month of her passing, this group of people 2 guys and 2 girls, asked me to come hang out with them, we became decently good friends after this,* I did gain bad habits from them, i started drinking because of them. Even got tattoos, and lost my first kiss to one of them.* Long story short, I'm entirely to blame for our friendship falling apart. My depression and trust issues got in the way, and they weren't about that lifestyle.* I was more of baggage than a friend. Again i'm to blame for this,&amp;#x200B;# University Part 2* I ended up dropping out of university in 2018, and i went back to Canada, and I've pretty much been here since then, gained a lot of weight, and have almost lost my mind completely.# Family* Our family has grown apart, i have no connections to my cousins, and most of my family has passed away.* I'm no longer close with my older brother, we have had our fair share of fights, and 90% of the time it was my fault, and i take blame for it. We don't talk as much, but i don't say anything to him anymore to upset him.* My parents say i'm fine and nothing is wrong with me, and that i no longer need antidepressants, and they keep bringing it up that i should go back to medical school, even though i don't want to.&amp;#x200B;# Pain Part 1* My brother has a girlfriend, who was really nice to me, kind of wish she was my sister, but it is what it is. She'd stay over sometimes for weeks, while they were studying. * I remember opening up to her about everything, and right away, and for the first time i actually felt better, whenever i'd relapse and have a panic attack, she was there to help with the pain. She'd say the right things at the right moment.* I hate myself for causing her so much of problems, i did overstep boundaries, asking if i could call her when she's free to talk about what i'm going through.* My brother didn't like it, and it would cause a lot of problems and rift between everyone, to the point where she didn't want to stay over anymore, because she felt like she was the problem.* This was all my fault, and i should of never opened up to her, or overstep boundaries.But my brother did turn around at some point, and did allow her to help me, but i took advantage of her kindness, and asked for to much help, probably overwhelming her with all my problems.In my eyes she changed quite a lot after she graduated, maybe it was to protect herself from her own demons. And when ever i'd tell her that she changed, she would get upset, sometimes block me, and then telling me it hurts when i tried so hard and to hear how \"i changed, and i'm a bad person for leaving\"&amp;#x200B;I't took me a while to realize that i was causing the same person who was trying their best to save me from my own demons, so much of pain.&amp;#x200B;I'f i could go back in time, i'd rather suffer the pain and not tell her.We had a really bad fall out, and both her and my brother stopped talking to me.I still remember the words she told that still to this day makes me cry.\" I tried to help you but you don't listen anymore, and you keep doing the same thing, and i need to step back and i can't help you anymore\" when i heard those words, i lost all hope.This was when my brother and her went for graduation.I'm a shitty person, because i ruined her graduation weekend, by getting upset at her for ignoring me all of a sudden.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward, we go back home after graduation, both her and my brother left our house, and he went to stay with her and her family. Nobody spoke to me for almost a month. I felt like such a monster.&amp;#x200B;# My lowest point.I ended up emailing her, telling her a lot of bad things, how she quit on me, and that i feel like an evil person etc, and i told her i'm going to kill myself because i am in too much of pain.i really am a shitty person, i ended up taking a bunch of pills, and ended up in the hospital for 4 days. Since then we haven't talked as much, or whenever i mention my problems, she'd tell me to talk to my parents.&amp;#x200B;I don't blame her for diverting all the time, she has her own demons herself. I still don't know why she still talks to me. I know it's not the same person who use to go out of their way to help me. &amp;#x200B;We still talk these days, but it doesn't feel the same anymore, and i think today is the day i stop talking to her, and let her and my brother live their life.  &amp;#x200B;I don't want to cause anyone any pain anymore.&amp;#x200B;Nobody really tried like she did. I'll always appreciate it.&amp;#x200B;I'm sorry if my story is all over the place, i have no one to talk to, and i've been thinking of leaving this earth this past few weeks. It's been getting worse each and each day. My depression has completely taking over me. I struggle to take a shower, sometimes i don't shower for days.&amp;#x200B;I don't know what to do anymore?? i'm seriously thinking about ended it all, it feels like i can't breath anymore. I have no money, no job, no friends, (feels like i have no family) all i have is my demons. And i want them gone.&amp;#x200B;# More info if anyone is interested ( Psychologist, Medication)* I've been on may different antidepressants, but they didn't seem to work.* Also been to many different psychologist, many sessions, but i didn't feel any different about myself.* I've even been to group therapy for 2 weeks, after trying to take my life, but even that didn't help.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1593902360.0, "author": "anniehall330", "title": "I just can’t do this anymore.

Yet he knows how the withdrawal could affect you.I can’t feel joy or happiness, nothing, I ordered clothes to make me happy. They didn’t. I ordered makeups to make me happy nothing. I am just a bystander.I got a 5 during my pathophysiology exam and only those who got a 5 will be invited to a fancy dinner party organised by the Department. Yet I am not happy or fulfilled. I didn’t take one of my exams ( a little one you don’t have to repeat the semester for it you can just take the class over the next year) and I had huge anxiety attacks after that and guilt that they will drop me out of the university.In fact I always have this huge irrational fear that I forgot something and I will be dropped out of med school.I lost some years due to the fact that I was too afraid to take exams and I couldn’t go. No confidence and it was a plus thing to come over and it totally took a toll on my mental health.Narcissistic parents especially my mother who is in hospital now and she constantly blackmails me psychologycally, talks bad things behind my back even to strangers, creates guilt in me, no support, nothing. She does the same to my brother who has the same problems as me.Ofc no relationship at the age of 25, never had anything serious or loving, only people who were kinda attracted to me. I think they sensed my lack of self confidence and weaknesses and they took advantage of it. Honestly I gave up the thought of a healthy loving relationship, I guess it will never find me, because how messed up I am or I am unlovable. Everybody is like wait for it and I am sure you will find somebody who deserves you but not really. I just cut ties with toxic guys. So nothing.Currently I am back in my hometown from university for a while and I have no friends here anymore. They moved out of town or we lost contact etc.I feel like I am uninteresting, unlovable mess, who constantly messes up everything and never will be happy.I am 25 and I have mental health issues since the age of 11-12 I guess but all my memories from my childhood are connected with anxiety.It just feels like that if I feel this shit at 25 and I felt shit during my whole life then how am I going to feel at 50 or 40? If I ever make it there.I am the bystander of my own life and it just passes and I can’t live only survive and it sucks. I don’t really find the meaning of life, I don’t have real friends, I realised many of them were or are toxic ones. I don’t feel anything positive, just I really feel like I have to survive. And life is just negative things nothing good ever happens. Only financial problems, health issues, backstabbing, losing a loved one, break ups, cheatings etc...And I also realised that you are only worth anything in this life if you have money, you aren’t really worthy oh no, it’s just your money. Every company is so nice and put this mask on how they support a noble cause ( like Coca Cola during pride month) but in reality it’s just all for money and they don’t really care. Or companies like H&amp;M ( how they are gonna make environment friendly clothes yet they have workers in India and Bangladesh who suffer to make end meets for a really bad salary working for 12-14 hours)It’s just hypocrisy. And these things just remind me that human life and fates are nothing to the world, only money is your worth. Of course the latter ones didn’t cause my health issues it’s just a plus and to basically realise how bad the world it is. Even if somebody does something to be just kind they must make a video of it for views.

Today I had to take a drug screen they do the urinalysis and for me they are extremely hard. I have to use a hat, I’m female, because of my stupid body. Then, I take what I call an anti pee pill. I have to take it otherwise the smallest amount of liquid going in causes me to basically piss my pants even if I’m just 5 feet away from the bathroom. As soon as the urge hits, it’s too late. Have had this problem since I was 7, am now 36 so I’ve taken a pill the last 10 years. I take 2 in the morning and 2 before bed. It typically causes a little issue doing a pee test but I can handle it. Today was not the day. I drank a lot on my way to the testing site, i then was like here we go. She didn’t want me to use the hat and I’m like legit I have to use it. Then you have 4 minutes to take the test. I’m like ok give me a time limit. Deer in headlights for the whole 4 minutes. Wasted that hat and cup. Get a 8oz bottle of water. I drink it and ask for another can’t have another until I pee or until 30 minutes later. So I feel the urge to go like I feel I’m going to potty in my pants I’m like yes let’s do this. Literally barely enough pee to fill a soda bottle cap. Like wtf is that. Tried again same shit and now they are out of hats so it’s a refusal to take the test. Lost that job due to refusing the drug screen. Then hear from a job that I did a 4 fucking interviews for that they moved on with someone else. Then, looked at my states job site of all the jobs for state gov jobs applied too have all been listed at “not selected” got email for one of them. So three in a matter of 2 hours plus the other 4 that were “not selected” but no notification yet. Like seriously this is weighing down on me. I want to work, I’m ready to work, I know this is a rough time as we are dealing with COVID but also that IT positions in my area had hundreds of applicants both locals and the out of staters that move here every day making it harder. Move here I don’t care, it’s just more experienced people in IT that will get jobs over me. I’m all about entry level right now. And like they train you, you don’t need technical skills to even get the job and I have tech skills but still not getting the jobs. I feel like a fucking loser! My husband just says don’t give up. And it’s like how can I not. In 3 months I’ve been turned down for approximately 45 jobs if not more. Told my husband I’m going to take a couple months off, still gonna look but not make it my job everyday and instead I’m going to do some self studying and try to pass CompTIA Network+ certification and CompTIA A+ and try again. I’m just  cc so frustrated and tired of being turned down for jobs I can do and do very well. I know a lot of people going thru this, but I feel like I was lied too.

I read that amineptine it is currently sold in India and Egypt.  I ask Indian and Egyptian users to check the current availability of this drug in these countries. anyone who knows a pharmacy, a small pharmaceutical industry that synthesizes it on commission or sell it, please let me know. I'm from Europe,but I saw that is possible to buy as a \"research purpose only\" molecule from private pharmaceutical companies in USA. Anyone can help?  if we join forces we can find it or have it produced, alone i can do little, only by passing from words to deeds, we can hope to get something. There are a lot of website of \"India markets\" that sell it, but they're all scams, that ask 100 or more dollars for 20 pills but didn't ship anything after receiving money, speculating on world's famine of amineptine. we have to collaborate and join forces, because this drug could be a life-saver. unfortunately it was withdrawn from the market because it really worked, and people were returning to their lives, ending up wasting money on unnecessary psychotherapy or ssri (check forums where users shares their experience with amineptine,it was amazing, more stamina, improved cognitive and memory, even better orgasm). this was unacceptable to lobbies, because a depressed patient is a client who spends money for life for ineffective treatments, and could not accept that people healed.  the reality is that amineptine was taking away the market from the ssri therefore it was withdrawn for phantom security reasons. I was visited by the best psychiatrist and neurologist,  working in hospitals and teaching at universities. They all said that to me, I'm not invent from my mind,they also told me that was amazing with parkinson too,without the dangerous sides of pramipexole for example. it was developed in France by Servier (the same company that produce stablon - tianeptine) and had a market share higher than the ssri.  the abuse problem was due to the fact that it was erroneously used in cocaine disaffection therapy, so cocaine addicts took huge quantities (10-20 grams per day) to try to recreate the same effect as cocaine. The lobbies used this fact to justify the withdrawal of amineptine. Consider that. ..have you ever seen a medicine withdrawn all over the world in the same moment for some abuse by cocaine addicts? Never happened...there are tons of harmful medication with hundreds of papers and studies demonstrating it, but still selled worldwide, even if patients and doctors know about the toxicity... and in any case we speak of very few cases, which do not concern depressed patients.  psychiatrists told me that bupropion it is used as a therapy for disaffection by cocaine too, and is taken by cocaine addicts shredded and then inhaled, but wasn't withdrawn from the market....For more info read thiswww.amineptine.com(The source indicated in this site however is not reliable,don't buy on it , don't waste money, it's a scam, i already tried and tested the shit selled and wasn't pure, with a lot of impurities, not for human consumption)", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1593002380.0, "author": "realManuSharma", "title": "I am depressed...

But the culture hurts people more than someone expects. I am a 19-year-old Indian in depression. I blame the culture and gender norms for my depression.The culture in India is so bad that parents **don't think** it's important for kids to have their privacy. I don't even have a lock for my room and my mom said she'd even tear down the walls for my room if necessary. Which I was and still am afraid that she'd do. I have been controlled by guilt, shame and with a word called \"respect\" all my life and compromise is not meeting in the middle but It's accepting all the demands and then choosing VERY FEW of the options now left for me which I am not interested in.I have so many things I'd like to say to all parents but they are not willing to listen. This is the same way many of our parents have been raised. Putting aside if it is the correct way or not, We are NOT stuck in the 1990s, we are in 2020, Please, I am NOT asking YOU to change, parents. I'm just asking you to let your children decide how they live in at least in a few parts of their life. Advice is always appreciated, so is your concern but that doesn't justify you threatening to do something that we find sadness in.My mom says \"You need to look after us when we get old.\" Which I got to admit is pretty common in Indian culture so she doesn't seem to think anything is wrong with it but I got a life that I didn't ask. I lived a life that was not mine. Everything that has happened is something that I didn't wish for. All I wished was that we stay happy as a family without any fights.I don't know when did our society forgot that children are their own person. Not a tool to compare marks with other parents. Not a pet to give commands. Parents and Adults expect us to act like adults while you treat us like children. You expect us to stay out of \"grown-up conversation\" when we try to be grown-ups, You make decisions without our consent then be angry if we do anything without your consent. I DO NOT think this is fair. How do you think this is fair? I like this quote \"I don't know how to act my age this is the first time I'm in it\". You can say just do as I say I have been your age, but you are/were not 19 years old in the year 2020.Times have changed, ways have changed, so many things have been invented to make our lives better but our mindset did not change. Please I have to ask you to not forget my experience and views. I have been hurt a lot and my priorities right now go like; Me, Internet/games, Parents. Yes. I like my internet and games more than my parents because I think if not for games and online friends, I'd have suicided in 9th grade itself, BECAUSE of my parents. I could say I hate them but they didn't know it was hurting me this bad, I didn't talk to them too. I don't think I can ever hate them but that also doesn't mean I can forgive them for what they did.

Promotion will be subject to onboard appraisal and even then there is no guarantee this was said by a superintendent who is a captain btw, one of the most negative persons you will ever met.Since Sep-19 I was trying for other companies , and luckily (or unluckily) My promotional thing was accepted by one of the largest ship management companies after clearing their interviews and all.Then in Feb-19 , I did their in house courses ,gave my documents etc. ,they have already lined up for a ship where joining would be in April. And thanks to Covid-19 , everything got fucked up. But then in end-may, Government of India  started giving permissions for charted flights specially for seafarers. Most of my friends have gone back to their jobs., while I am still stuck and the new company is not even giving me any hope.Since I had already given my documents and all to this new company, my present company won't entertain me as I haven't been keeping touch with them .Now , I am in a very critical situation .I am not able to pay the debts of a consumer loan which I had taken in nov-19 which is affecting my credit score and also huge interest of 36 percentage and also the bounce charges which is being levied by the bank .

Many here might say ,that I should not have buy a house or taken a loan, let me tell you that that whole life I have lived in a 150 sq.ft room, and I atleast deserved to live a better life after slogging so much and then also I played quite safe and my EMI is still 20 percentage of my yearly earnings.Every week , I am calling my new company and their response is abysmal ,now they say that the vessel which I had been lined up for has no sign off plans even for thr next monthIt's not that this has happened for the first time, since I joined this field in 2009, I have been facing a very tough time both proffesionally and personally. I have not given up on myself ,but then it is getting very difficult to stay positive and think good when life gives you blow after blows.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1592420635.0, "author": "tcamp213", "title": "After 5 years of fighting, I think I am ready.", "selftext": "I have been fighting the demons inside my mind for 5 years. And after tonight, I think I am finally ready to stop fighting, and let whatever is going to happen, happen. 5 years ago, when I was 15, I lost my best friend to Leukaemia. I was still in school, and it caused me to spiral. I took days off, but I was able to stabilise myself, and finish school a year later. After I graduated, I missed out on University, because it cost too much. I quickly realised that University wasn't for me anyway, and I decided on my new career path. I started talking to this girl online in March of 2017. She was 4 years older than me, but she was the first girl that really showed any interest in me, so I jumped at the chance, despite not actually feeling ready. Problem was she lived in Croatia, and I live in Australia. We agreed to go long distance for a few months, meet in November, and work things out from there. I should have realised something was wrong from the fact that she never wanted to call. She never wanted to talk long term plans. I started talking to another girl in India, because of this. I was told by Croatian girl in June of 2017, that she had been seeing someone else the whole time, and the only reason she was talking to me is because I made her feel special. During our \"relationship\" my mum had a severe stroke to which she will never recover. She lives in a Nursing Home a fair drive away from where I live now. Just after Croatian girl and I ended, I entered a long distance relationship with the Indian girl, and for the first few months it was heaven, until the cracks started to show. She was very emotionally immature, which caused her to lash out in fits of anger, we tried for 2 years, (young, naive kids with no money) fighting nearly daily, before she just abruptly left. I had to come to grips with the fact she was gone, but my friends helped me get through it. Almost a year to the day after it ended, the girl reached out. She was apologetic, told me she was incredibly sorry for the pain she caused me, and that she had moved on and was happy. She also wanted to be friends. That hurt, but it was what it was, I had no interest in being her friend, because the feelings were still unresolved. Skip forward to my current issue. She reached out a few days ago telling me she needed my help. I, like the idiot I am, responded. She told me she wanted to do some stuff on YouTube and that was it. She called, we discussed it, and I told her that I have no interest in communicating any further. She told me she planned on moving here. For the last few days, I had been receiving mixed messages from her, one minute she loved me, and she wanted to try again, the next she was saying it would never happen. I allowed myself to get suckered in, allowed myself to believe that there was a chance I could get back with the woman I had always thought was my soulmate. We just had a big fight after I told her that I couldn't be her friend.

There is not much scope for therapy in my small town(I'm from India) and I'm not really sure about online therapy. I contacted my psychiatrist again but they just said to increase my dosage without really hearing what I had to say.I always have had extremely intrusive thoughts which occur almost randomly, without any trigger. They usually range from thoughts of self loathing and disgust towards myself to violent thoughts. I do not have violent tendencies but I get these thoughts sometimes where I just see red and imagine inflicting pain on somebody. It can be a friend, my pet cat, family members, some stranger I met at the grocery store. They're always unprovoked from what I've noted. I  should stress that in no way, shape or form do I want to harm any living being but these thoughts just freeze my brain and for those few minutes, I cannot think about anything else but that. And post these thoughts, my thoughts again go on a self loathing marathon, disgusted at how I could even think about them..it is a loop, one that I cannot seem to escape.I used to self harm right until a few years ago, but I don't anymore.

Everyone struggles, fights, and try to do their best in life to keep living.........but for how long? Ever since I was a kid I have been outcasted by ever group and have been bullied and falsely accused of shit I have never done only to be punished for it with no evidence. I have been all alone growing up in this world and I am still alone today. My parents have been abusive verbally and physically since I was a kid and even now they still are. I will just give you a couple examples.I was falsely accused of hurting a kid when I was 13. There was only one witness his friend and my principle believed him and when my parents found out they never even questioned it and my father beat me with a belt and I was expelled for a week. There have been other instances of similar stuff happening later on.As a kid my parents would say that I am a stupid dog who can't get anything right when I couldn't understand something in school or homework and because I am slow and unable to do things quickly.My parents are also toxic to each other and I would have to try to sleep at night with them yelling at each other.Anything I enjoyed or was good at was considered pointless to my parents. Such as video games, reading books or comics, drawing, music and computers. My father would try to take these items away from me many periods in my life as a way to punish me for not doing well in school. It never worked.In my first year in high school freshman year I decided to change myself and do better in my studies. By the end of the year I was able to get a 3.4 gpa which was a big improvement from my middle school years because during those times I never even did my work or pay attention in class. I believe the only reason I even did well was because my cousin lived with me during that time and he would support me that year and be a good friend. Unfortunately he left next year as he realized how toxic my family was and couldn't deal with them anymore. In 10th grade I completely stopped trying. My homework was never done and any tests I did was always 10 percent or less. My teacher realizing something was wrong and told my parents. My parents then abused me even more by yelling and cussing at me. They would come in my room without even knocking. I would block the door sometimes with an object only for them to bang on the door for 10 minutes before giving up. My dad once kicked the door open and broke it so the door was always open and I could hear them downstairs saying how terrible and annoying I was. I failed 10th that year.My grandfather during this time had cancer so my dad forced everyone to leave everything In the US and go to India despite me not wanting to go. He convinced me that we would be back within a few months. This was a lie and he forced me to go to a boarding school there. If you're not familiar on what that is its when you live inside the school. They took me to the school to apparently go check it out and see if I liked it. Of course I didn't. My dad told me he was going to use the bathroom. He never came back apparently I was signed up for the school without my knowledge. You couldn't try to escape either as there were walls around the entire school and guards constantly patrolling during the day and night. The school had disgusting living conditions with bed bugs and rats living in the dorms. The food was all vegetarian which I didn't mind other then the fact it was disgusting with mosquito bugs in it. I had lost a lot of weight living there as I almost completely stopped eating only eating white bread with jam on it at time to time. During the summer the place was extremely hot. They wouldn't turn on the air conditioning even though they had it. They said it was because it was too expensive. Which was a complete lie as they were getting money from parents of kids each month. Way more then they should by the way. I have literally seen people pass out from heat stroke because of how hot it got. The worst part was the bullying. I was in fights almost everyday usually with me being by myself with 4 or 5 others ganging up on me. I used to get stuff stolen from my locker, they had broken the lock multiple times to get in to steal food I saved like chips and juice which was rare to find in our school as it was only given out in special occasions. At night they would kick open on my door on purpose or bang on it very loudly to wake me up. The teachers and staff never did anything as they felt that I was being too sensitive.Now comes the part of the story that gets worse. I have never shared this to anyone. I was sexually harassed a lot at that school. When I would use the bathroom they would kick the door open to peek. They would make sexual remarks and asking me to do sexual favors for them and in return they would leave me alone. They would literally show their private parts to me on purpose and when that didn't work well......they tried to force themselves on me and of course I resisted and fought back. This happened multiple times during that year. Things got so bad that they threatened to kill me. I would stay awake at night scared for me life that they would come to my room and actually do it. With no sleep at night I would sleep during the day during classes and would get yelled at by the teachers. I tried multiple attempts to kill myself in that school. There used to be a building that was usually empty during break. I would go there and lean on the edge of the roof of the building just looking down gathering the courage to actually do it. No one cared no one listened not even my parents. They would come visit me time to time or call me on one of the staff phones but every time I would tell them the terrible things that happened they just ignored it. I never really told them about the sexual abuse I faced I was to scared to tell them.......I didn't think they would believe me and to this day I still haven't. Later on during the end of the year I convinced one of my family members to let me come home and take the bus instead. This only pissed off the people who hated me even more. During break they would come to my classroom or outside and harass me constantly telling me that if I ever told anyone what happened that they would hurt me or kill me if I they had the chance. One time when I was in the bathroom I was put In a choke hold from behind, I honestly believe he was going to kill me as he was enraged and shouting random nonsense that I couldn't understand, something about God wanting this to happen. Luckily some other kid came in who saw the entire thing and he let go of me and ran off. I eventually passed my classes despite doing no work or doing any homework that was given as the studies their were completely different then what I learned. It was a couple grades above my level like advanced psychics, chemistry, and calculus. When the exams came I clearly flunked them but apparently my dad paid the school to have someone else take them for me. The day I was suppose to go take the exams I refused too. My dad called a friend and another family member to force me to go take me to school. I had locked the door to my room and of course they kicked it open. They grabbed me and said they would do whatever it takes for me to go. They would undress me and make me put on the school uniform if they had too......they did try to do that but I caved in and followed their orders as I didn't want anyone to get hurt especially me. When I did finish 10th there I was stuck in India for another 3 months. During that time I realized that my mom and my brother and gone back to the US a month after I was put into that school. They never even told me they left. Apparently my brother was put into school in India too but didn't like it and within the first week they took him out without question. During that time I had multiple panic attacks that would happen late at night no one really bothered to ask what the screaming was about and would tell me to go to sleep. One night I had a really bad one and it lasted for a while one of my Aunts started slapping me for being insane this didn't help and made it worse eventually they left me alone and I was able to calm down. After 3 months I was suppose to go home to the US by myself. I have flown and traveled alone a couple times before so I was familiar with what to do. Of course my dad made an excuse and said I wouldn't be able to do it and told me to go with my aunt to the Philippines. This was of course a lie as a way for me to live there instead. I went anyway and ended up living with my uncle for a short time.When I was there I remember an incident that happened. I was yelled at my uncle who I was living with for apparently refusing to accept money from a family member who was there as it is a cultural custom to give money to someone who is way younger then you. I refused it because I felt that I was not going to spend it on anything and even if I did I would get yelled at for spending it on something stupid. I ended up living with a different family member the next day. one month later I finally came home to the US.I barely passed high school after that and fast forward to today those days still haunt me today. I have tried getting help over the years from meeting doctors therapists psychiatrists and psychologists. Therapy never really helped and I decided to take medication which only made me worse and have more mental breakdowns. I ended up becoming completely numb only feeling my depression and anxiety and over the years I have grown angry towards myself and the people who have hurt me. I have tried to suppress it but bottling up your emotions doesn't really help. I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was given 5 medications that I would take every day. One for the mania, one for my depression and anxiety, one for sleep, another one for a side effect of constantly shaking and one for extreme nausea. I had gained a lot of weight because of this and I now weigh around 200 pounds to my previous 160. The medication has helped a lot but I eventually stopped taking it because of the many side effects. I went to India again recently and stayed there for 2 months which was a bad idea and the only reason I did was because of family issues that were needed to be dealt with. This caused old painful memories to come back. I finally asked my dad why he even put in that school when I was there. He said it was because he wanted to make me stronger and learn to grow up and teach me a lesson.I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I live in confusion everyday. Nothing feels right and the things I used to enjoy just don't anymore. Even video games which I thought I would never lose interest in just aren't fun anymore. Nothing feels real anymore not even myself. My dreams feel more real to me then life itself. I know the stuff that happened to me isn't my fault but what am I suppose to do. Ya I can go work out or find a job or do a hobby or go to collage but whats the point if there is no emotion behind it? If there is no feeling behind it? If I just had one person In my life who believed me who would listen to me who cared for me who actually loved me that would be enough. But there is no one not even family. At this point I am convinced there is really no hope for some people. Its funny how people say how they got out of depression or mental illness and that you can do it to. Are you really sure about that....you never hear about the people who gave up on life because most people never got to hear their stories its only those who survive that really get to tell theirs. Not everyone gets an opportunity and even if you do there is no grantee you will succeed. How long do I have to keep walking I am tired so tired. Maybe I am wrong about the way I am looking at this but this is all i know. Thank you for staying this long to listen to my story and the fact you came this far means a lot to me. I was able to get a lot off my chest and I really do appreciate you for helping me do that. I really hope for the best for all of you.

I used to live in Dubai and I had spent almost all my life there. We had to leave our house because it belonged to the company my dad was working for. I felt sad and on the last day, leaving it all, I cried. Now fast forward to a few months later. It was inevitable that we had to come to India. I joined a new school and oh boy was it fun. Everyone was absolutely unfriendly to the \"new kid\". Also I all the new kids in my neighbourhood were friendly but not too much. School was a disaster. My dad was in depression. He talked about collective suicide in front of me. My mom once locked herself in a room with knife. Thus had a profound effect on me. Then everything slowly started to settle. Or so I thought. My dad picked himself up. I found new friends in school and the neighbourhood kids also started warming to me. Then the mid term exams came along. Me and my friends got average marks. This was devastating. My one friend blamed me for his marks and he stopped talking with me. That was rock bottom 1. You see I depended emotionally on my friends. I really don't know why. Also the neighbourhood kids now started treating me like shit. Everything was worse. Then some dude in school who I knew and was friendly with invited me to join his group of friends. And I thought it was a new start. It was all over. Again I was wrong. Slowly I established a good rapport with all of them. And at the end of 8th grade, I left school happily. Then 9th started and all of my friends at school now started to distance themselves. For some unknown reason. But slowly we again started showing the same signs of friendship. So it was all okay. I guess. But I didn't know that I was headed to something much worse. I became the butt of all jokes. At first it wasn't even that bad. But then they started getting much more personal. They weren't even jokes at that point. They were straight up insults. That was depressing. Also I had just recovered from low self esteem. I think I had it at least. So again this was a blow to my self confidence. My friends were completely insensitive to my condition. They knew by the way. I even showed self destructive tendencies. Yet they never even tried. Like I told I was emotionally dependent on my friends. You see 9th is an important year. So parental pressure was at an all time high. They would start pointing all the small mistakes, even if they weren't mistakes. The neighbourhood kids  started treating me like shit again because I couldn't play cricket well. That was the sport that all those guys played. So home wasn't a happy place . School wasn't a happy place. And anywhere else wasn't a happy place. Slowly I started descending into insanity or at least it felt like it. I was briefly suicidal in my 8th. But in my 9th it was much longer. I had a stupid ideology that I was talentless and useless. And if I am that, then I should just kill myself, right? So I tried that. Nobody ever told me that choking yourself doesn't kill you. So that is what I did. 3 different times. This was rock bottom 2. But things went on with their ups and downs. One day my friends at school took it too far. I was sad about it. My mom after some digging found out about the teasing. That is only because it would affect my studies and completely  ignored the mental effects. She told my dad. And then he called my friend and asked him never to talk to me again. This was devastating as I was emotionally dependent on my friends. And also everyone was like this guy's cronies. So if he stopped talking, everyone would. And that thought terrified me. My dad even swore at me for being such a wuss. But this was a blessing in disguise. As I regained my self esteem. And I found out about my dependency on my friends. So I was able to control it. After a few fights and setting boundaries with the neighbourhood kids, they finally started respected me. They understood I wouldn't take any shit. Now I'm in 10th. Most important year of school life. No parental pressure is almost unbearable. I still cry sometimes. I get average marks in my tests. I used to get good before. Whenever I get bad marks , I cry a lot. I even sometimes feel like killing myself. And also know these are small tests. What is wrong with me? Please someone tell me. My parents tell me counseling is useless. They think whatever they say is EXACTLY what the counsellet would say. I know they want the best for me. But their approach is dead wrong. For me, at least. They don't realize the impact their actions have on me. Am I the wrong one ? What should I change in myself ? Am I  just being melodramatic ? Am I being stupid ? Do I just want sympathy ?

I was confused at that time so i talked with many and got to know that after giving mba exams in November and December i can join in some companies in January and if I get a good college i can go there or else work in my company so i liked the idea and go for the mba.Fast forward to that i gave many exams got some decent scores not upto my expectations but i didn't wanted to waste a year so thought should go for the options i have but even before i could do some things i had an accident and got my back and leg injured and couldn't attend the MBA interviews neither could work for any company and my whole year got wasted.And after some time i recovered partially and was told that lower back injuries take time but i can do normal works just should not lift heavy or do any such. Exercises so i was already much depressed and out of sync with any thing so i contacted my friends and everybody said that since a year has gone without experience no company would take me and it was another shock for me.I talked to almost everybody i could and nothing was in my favour.Then a friend suggested me that i already had interned in big data during college time so i should learn machine learning and data science and i could get a decent package job. So i started learning those things but i was utterly depressed and could not get my mind to learn much in simple words my productivity was very low and before i could apply to some companies this corona happened and now most companies have their hiring freezed and i am fucking lost and feel ashamed of myself that during such crisis i cant help my family financially and even though being the such a smartass i eventually became a disgrace.Seriously why such things happen with me  and  please tell me how could i get out of all this and  be like the person i used to be and get my life back on track", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1588883196.0, "author": "LightningShiva1", "title": "Why do my parents beat me for everything, when it's not my mistake.

The so called digital transformation that some countries feared and yet under these extraordinary times of Covid , Google and Microsoft has claimed that Digital transformation that should have taken 2 years ,has taken place in 20 days.Some say that its a way of Chinese suppression of the hong kong protest , which we don't hear about now a days , as if its gone extinct .Some say that its a pharma Medical War , involving Vaccines with surveillance nanochips slide into the bodies of the entire 7 billion world population by Bill gates or by many other companies , as we see Bill Gates so much involved in all these vaccines. Some say that its a Chinese bioweapon gone rogue , that's why chinese have denied access for the international probe.Some say that its the Chinese way of staying ahead of the US in terms of economy , because Chinese are far ahead in terms of covid timeline which gives them a jumpstart , as they resume operations when countries like India shuts down .Some say that its the US way of planting its own virus in china , in order to create a global hate , which in some sense has been achieved and inorder to disrupt the foreign economies , by taking advantage of other countries . Take for example : Facebook's investment in India , rise in Bezozs Wealth , Google domination , Microsoft pills. Some say that its a show of supremacy like if America shuts down , so will the entire world go down . Some say that Capitalism has brought this inorder to show that You are born and dead just to contribute your part in the overflated economy . Because we can see so many people telling how economies will kill more people than Covid .Some say that Modiji has a political motive behind national wide lockdown , while he could have given states the power to do as they pleased with centre's guidance because we can see his approval ratings has risen more than Uri effect . People are now lighting lamps , clapping hands if he tells. Well I guess that he is really Smart.Some experts say 60 million ICU beds would have been required if this lockdown wasn't imposed that will take atleast 15 normal years of medicial infrastructure growth to facilitate that . Because we know that India lacks in medical infrastructure .Some says that its the nature's way of reacting to man made pollutions , as we all  see now the ozone layer fixing itself and the pollution coming all down.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....All of these thoughts were like from yesterday...Or is it my mistake that all these thoughts broke out. Yet I still don't know the truth , I was a simple guy then......After knowing this much , I continue to stare at the only mirror in my room , in which I have been locked down for 40 years. I don't smile , I don't cry , I don't have any emotions Its 2041 now , I guess , I don't knowIts just me and my face on the mirror , I don't know what is happening on the outside world , I don't know how are my parents are holding up physically , in the other rooms . They don't speak with each other too.. Probably they would also be staring at the mirror like me or they would have forgotten the fact that I still live . Because I myself don't know if they even exist.Its just a Photo that reminds me that I and my parents existed in this so called world i was born into, I still wonder why was I even born ? Is it to have the same thought process all these years.My cells have adopted , my body doesn't require as much as food , sleep or anything that I would have had 20 years back . I don't know how the food comes , it just comes . It was like yesterday when the first Covid patient died I used to be a 21 year old guy then , from a middle class family.With so many complex problems that I had to face Being single , girlfriend , sex , love , job , cooking, money, dad , sister, caste , reservations , marks , grades , professors , social acceptance , wanna be rich , powerful , famous ..........were all the obstacle I had at that time , which I still believe to have because all of that made me realise that I was either stupid or I was living life like how general audience would live theirs.But here I am, still looking at the only mirror in my room... as all these thoughts pass by daily . It started with my sister , she was Covid positive , and after that , we were put in quarrentine , but I had a connection with the world then . I got the newspapers, the nurses told me stuffs . But after Some months everything stopped . I don't see the nurses too. Hope she's doing well. Hope she's aliveI have never seen or heard anything since then .The last time I heard about something in a very long time ,  was in 2036 when they said that they were shifting me because the place where I stayed had been affected by the rising water level and that half of Antarctica had swallowed up most of the major cites of the world.I don't know how the world is now .I don't know if my sister is alive or dead , the last time I saw her was when she was holding my hands in fear , I kissed her and told her that you'll come back soon and healthy .I think Covid was just first of its kind and after that many more, with power more infinite than its earlier impact , has taken a stroll on this insane world , with different outcomes . I wonder if there's a America or India now?Guess what if our prime minister is even alive ? I still don't know \" How do I still remain sane.\" After all these madness and Illusions I have been through.Its probably the drug injected food . Here I am still emotionless , staring at the same only mirror , with the hope that I could give my body its peace but all I can see in this empty room is that there's no means to end my meaningless life , rotted by the selfishness of some people who run or think that they run this empty world . I guess I would have had a normal life or a better life if I just had the proper amount of money and power back then.I have accepted the reality that this is my new illusion which I should feel real just like those old days.Is it just me ?

I thought at the time that is what I wanted to do. After I graduated, I was pressurized by my family to study further. To make a quick decision. So I went ahead and applied for a Masters at Columbia University in NYC. I got through and decided to go, because come on I always dreamt of living In NYC. I graduated earlier than the rest of my classmates, got a good job, I worked at for 3 years. I was great at my job. But it didn’t fulfill me. My father has a business in construction, I was forced by my mother to come back to India. “Do this work for your dad instead for someone else” Now because I am the only child, I thought it is my duty to stay close to my parents. Also it was a super attractive option for me to be working for my business (albeit my dad’s but it wouldn’t feel like a job) came back. In the last few months my father’s business declined due to fall in economy in India. Now my mother is forcing me to take a job. I have dreams to start my own business. I have many plans. It is not going to be in my field, but because my masters course was half management, I feel confident to start my own business (I have done market study to see the feasibility and I am confident with some investment I will be able to make a profit in a year). I just want to make it happen, i know it will make me happy, I know that even if it fails, I will be happy in the future that I atleast tried and it wasn’t just a “what if”.Now while I work on setting up my business (of course i can do the ground work only after all this quarantining is done) my mother has been extremely negative and demoralizes every single day. She tells me they wasted the money on me that they spent on my education. That I should work in a job. That I am a waste of education and space. It does hurt and mess with me a lot. It makes me doubt myself. Am i making a mistake by choosing a diff career that what I studied? Will I regret doing this later? I don’t know. I only feel a bit cheated that I left my fairly comfortable life back in NYC to come back and now am being forced into a very competitive low paying market just because my mother wants so.

I am 19 years old(20 in September),in 1st year of engineering in India. Since 2016(11th grade),somehow I have done just nothing. I had been an above average student,  but somehow I just started procrastinating,being completely shy, introvert and turned into a complete daydreamer.My grades started getting worse, started failing subjects, started having hair loss, getting fat, no personal life or relationships.2016 and 2017 just went by procrastinating, academically failure, and simply just blank. I used to just sit with an open book and just couldn't study, used to play football, used to read novels, but just wouldn't felt like doing, the only I wanted was to just sit in my room and do nothing. So by 2018 I finished  school with low grades,  failed all entrance exams, for the universities I wanted to go. So In 2018 I decided to just take a gap, and to get out of the the mental hell I have put myself into. I realised I was depressed  .Being 18 with no aim,no specific talent, academically failure, from a financially mediocre family so nothing like ever I have spend money on myself and father also retired, and shy person I was,  forget girlfriend,i don't think I even Know a girl whom I can call a friend.Many times I have cried myself to sleep. Realising what a person I have become,  I just felt suicidal. The only reason I didnt do it probably was, all the things I was going through were my own fucking problems.Like I never gone through any physical or mental abuse, never have done drugs, smoking or alcohol, and have decent loving parents.Just a normal guy,but somehow over thinking I turned myself into a loser.But I just accepted the fact that I am depressed,  but suicide is just isn't options.I just accepted that I am not going to have the best life I thought of,  but the least now I wanted was to get financially get stable,  to support me and family. I accepted that being with a girl or having a relationship is just not my cup of tea and just decided that from now on I just focus on studies and go through university,  get a job and live on my own. In 2019 I joined a mediocre college(engineering), and somehow accepting what I can have,  what I cannot has helped a lot,  but It just becomes difficult to study things which you actually don't like but u just have to do,  cuz you have failed earthing others. Somehow 2019 went by passing semester somehow, at least one thing to get pleased,but if I'll be true to myself,  I myself know that I am not happy. I wake up sulking knowing another day of doing things which I don't want to,  but somehow I have to. But by March 2020 I have felt really interested in studing computer science, and with that the start of lock down,  I decided to do online courses so as to get my appropriate skills and improve my resume.But because old habits don't go so easily,  today it's April 26 and I haven't studied single line the whole time,  just have procrastinated everything.I don't know how to say but I just feel so bad of myself. Right now,  I want to just forget all the past and  focus all my time for studying and probably in 2-3 years get a job,  and that's reason I wrote all of this, I want to start fresh.Hope writing this helps me.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1587471139.0, "author": "lurker_creep", "title": "I'm at the end", "selftext": "This is long.

This long mindvomit is not urgent. I just felt like I needed to 'diary' it. I have been diagnosed with a depression and anxiety disorder.  Depression runs in my family, even my great grandma was in an institution. I had my first incident with depression in my childhood, around 12 years old. 12 years old life was good. Had friends, played guitar, rode skateboard , read books, started learning computers. But suddenly it all stopped. Didn't bring a notepad to school. no pen. no bag. stopped caring. Stopped everything, became empty. Went to a psych ward, where I was diagnosed with the above.Then trying to hide the reality of me being 'insane' and trying to forget, fit in and never to repeat, please.Second bout od hardcore depression came two years ago, after I burned out from work. Afterwards, me and my girlfriend have traveled the world. Trips of a lifetime for most. Asia, America, Europe. Amazing experiences for most . And I only had like 5 seconds of hapiness after all the experinces and achievments we had. (ie. we trekked 15 days to see a specific vista in Himalayas). My mind just doesn't care. I have lost the light taht keeps people going. I just smile and nod to make my gf happy. She is ecstatic. I don't want to destroy her hapiness. I fake my emotions, because I am empty inside.I am now medicated by cipralex. It took away some  of my anxiety and left me kinda without the everlasting pressure in my chest and left me emptier than I thought it would. It left me scared and tired.Previous medication left me impotent and tired.Work is good, they know my condition. They understand it. I am a software developer. I can work when I feel like it and make enough to keep me going.Love of my life is with me for 13 years and we are planning a wedding and children.I just came back from my friend's flat, where I kidnapped all of the possible conversation and just twisted it to talk about my depression. I am sorry I destroyed a pottentianly fun evening. Every topic I kidnapped and destroyed. In the end I had to beg them to stop me. My gf is getting overworked and because of my melancholic passivity, she's showing signs of depression too. (depressed feelings, not clincal) I am sure she got it from me.. She cries, nothing excites her. I can't make a fun schedule I'd be able to follow and make her happy. Our relationship, which is basically the only thing that is worth something in my life is slipping through my fingers.I tried everything I could find about making your life better. I joined a gym, I went to therapy. I talked to my family. I am on my third psychiatrist and fifth medication. I ran every day. I tried interminent fasting. I went to India to practice yoga and also meditation. All of these things I forced myself to stick with for atleast three months. Most of the time it stressed me so much I coulndn't sleep the night before whatever I was supposed to the next day rendering it useless.Lately, I wake up every day with a vivid image of me with a noose around my neck, rope swung around a tree branch, the other end hanging in front of me. I am trying to climb the other end. This situation comes up before me brain boots up. It is buried in my subconscience. I never realistically thought of killing myself. But the image is there every day. It doesn't even physically work. You can't lift yourself trying to climb the other end. Still I wake up and it is burned into my mind. I am laying in bed kinda paralyzed, my limbs heavy in a meditative state which I didn't attempt. I lay there, kinda sleeping , kinda awake, contemplating the physical paradox of trying to climb the other end and somehow maybe hanging myself. If I am not forced from bed, I do that for 2 or more hours until I need to pee. I'm not gonna kill myself , never thought I would. It's gonna get better. Life can be fun.I started drinking heavily, just to feel something. I started smoking for whatever stupid reason. I got introduced to cocaine, which I never thought I would come into contact with.I stopped being able to do even the minimal amount of work I am supposed to do. I go to my personal office, I freak out, that I should be doing something. I smoke a shitton of cancersticks, drink rum, get angry at myself for wrecking my productive day, do cocaine to start working... aaaand repeat all of the above. This became my daily schedule. I am not yet addicted heavily. If I leave this routine, I don't have to smoke, drink or do drugs. But when left with my own devices, I numb myself, trying to get an emotion, which would be fake anyway. But I just fuck myself up, knowing I shouldn't, before, knowing I shouldn't have after. Then do the same the next day. This might look regular to some, but I am abusing everything right now, puking at 3pm in my own office.  Worst is, the next day, I try destroy myself again. I am on a trajectory to hell. I am gonna wreck myself.But weirdly, when I thought of all the destructive shit I am doing, I found solace and hope in the final result.I am gonna destroy myself into nothing. Place, from which is no other way than up.I am gonna drink until I puke. I am gonna smoke until I am sick. I am gonna do the line and hate myself. I will become the worst bundle of shit the world has ever seen. And then I will start anew.And then appreciate everything but the above .-------I showered - good, atleast you didnt drink all day, masking problems, trying to find an emotion.I cooked - good, atleast I did something productive and didn't smoke a pack trying to kill myself with cancer.I went for a walk - good, atleast I didn't do hard drugs, lying to myself I need it just to do my job.--------I know this is a wrong, bad idea, but it is where I am heading. I just need to hang onto something real before I get there. But will I? What do I want to hear from you? Is there anything that can possibly enlighten or help me here?

Fast forward to a few months later, then the crap started. I was bullied, a lot, A LOT, everyday it was for a new reason. We have a small race here in India called the Tamilians, and I lived in a city where people from the same heritage were hated ( for this and many other reasons I did not know), and every single day I was bullied to death, beaten up, verbally abused for absolutely no reason at all. Every single day in school was hell to me. Some people miss their school, i am afraid of mine. Nobody was ever friends with me, so one day I made up a story about having visited and resided in the USA, for some reason everybody suddenly wanted to talk to me, asked me about how it was, for once I had people who wanted to talk to me. So I continued forging story after story, filled end to end with lies, and never stopped. To this day people know me as someone who's partially American. I was never really good at anything, at all, no sports, I play video games with a few friends, but I'm always made fun of because I suck. Everytime I try to soul my guys about why I'm sad I get labelled as an attention seeker or sympathy seeker and get made fun of and ignored again. Until today I haven't done a single thing that makes my parents proud to state the fact that I am their son, I've always ended up disappointing my father, who worked very very hard to bring us to the comfort we have now. You don't even have to ask me about my love life, topping this all off with around 12-14 rejections all from various diff girls. All I ever want is for people to like me and consider me as a friend. I have never had someone who I can call my best friend, and he or she the same. Havent had anyone except family show any sort of concern about me. I'm 19 now, and I am still made fun of all the time, still lonely, still powerless, still, a loser. I've always had dreams or goals, but I could never achieve them, my mother thought I was messed up in the head and took me through a psych analysis. People always roast me or make fun of me for trying to live off pity. So I've decided that I don't need pity if I am frickin dead.

She didn't take it well, and just unloaded on me (she's a hot-head, and winds up saying things she sometimes regrets). Long story short, she just said she's \"sorry for trying to help\", and that I should see a professional, because she can't talk to me.

From a long time, especially the last 2 months, i have been really depressed and anxious about the future. I have a 16 y/o sister, whom i really love and care about. From last 1.5 year, she has been in a relationship with a boy who is 1 year older than me. My mother knows about this relationship, and she had no option, but to support it. My father, however, is completely unaware of this, and thinks that his daughter is very \"good\" in that sense. Both my father and my sister's boyfriend are complete bigots and full on narcissists. If my father got cognizant of the hidden relationship, he will do things, that even upon thinking, i hyperventilate and get anxious. On the other hand, my sister's bf constantly blackmails her into keeping up the relationship, that she is now REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN. However, i don't think that he blackmails for other more private stuff.  The basis of his blackmail is that he will tell my father about the whole relationship thing. Which, consequently, will make us all (me, my mother, my sister) liars in his eyes, which is BAD, SERIOUSLY BAD. My anxiety is crippling me, i am all the time tired, no motivations and no will to fight. It's like i am imploding, not exploding: i don't cry at all, i just sit and my body feels like it's getting more and more hollow. We run a pharmaceutical business, so after some research, i self prescribed a dose of pregabalin to reduce anxiety, without the need of acquiring a prescription. I have been taking it for like 5 days and it is showing lil effects. In January, most probably, her bf will go to Canada for study purposes, which will subside this whole mess. As of now, he has made attempts to call my father to tell him about all that, but he never said anything on phone, and just hanged up the call. There are less chances of him actually calling my father, cos he knows that it will certainly end the relationship. My sister is not at all interested in the relationship. She never ever complaints thought, thinking that it would make my mother and me anxious. She is very brave. Truly. My mother, who has suffered all her life from my ass father, also gets anxious and worried about the future. She also suffers from migraines, so more stress causes real bad headaches. Both of them are very brave and they are fighting for what could happen. But, I am not, I get super scared and anxious when all this happens. I don't know how to normalize, and feel ok. It's like eating me. Sometimes i think of real bad stuff happening to both the bigots, and sometimes i feel as cuffed and restrained. I know it's not life and death matter, but it's certainly not comfortable also. There is this fear that always lingers, about what would happen.

So I'm posting it here.Hi,I want to share a secret which is killing me. I don't have anyone right now.... So I'm posting it here.6Years ago I met this girl who later became my best best friend. We were inseparable. People often taught that we were a couple. When I met her she told me that she was out of a \"bad and controlling relationship\". Other than that everything was normal.3 Years after that we were even more close. I started developing feelings for her,at first it was really confusing and I had to keep quiet because she is from an orthodox bramin(cast) family. If they ever find out that she is dating a non bramin they would kick her out. I just suppressed my feelings untill we both were about to graduate.Just few months before our graduation. The way she spoke felt like signals... Anybody would say thay they were signals.\" I like you, I love you, I hope I can stay with you, I really feel safe with you\". So I tought that she really likes me too and  I told her that I like her and I would like to take her out on a date. She abruptly rejected me and told me that \" Sorry if you have taken my friendship the wrong way, it's on me...I'm really sorry\".Because of everything that happened before... the way we were... Idiot me didn't understand the situation and tought that she is just afraid of her family(This situation often happens in India). So after a lot of discussion we came to a conclusion. The idea was something like \"if I can get into an IIT (India's best tech school) I would get to ask her on a date.\" ~ Which roughly translates to, get successful and you might get me.That day was the happiest day of my life. I tough thay she is afraid of her family... and guess what she is !!! Why else would she say thay I'll get a date if I get into an IIT.Fast forward, I'm still working hard everyday just so that I can be with her. I truly loved her 🥺. She was my one true love. I spent most of my time with her chatting.Just days before my exam I figured out something really gruesome. She still loves her EX. She had to break up with him because her parents didn't accept his cast.But still she loves him and is waiting for him. I FELT BROKEN... EVERYTHING WAS A LIE.... She could have told me that she likes someone else. Insted she gave me a fake promise. THAT MOMENT I REALISED THAT I WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMOTIONAL REPLACEMENT.She apologized to me and told me that she didn't tell it to anyone and it is a secret. It felt like the person I loved doesn't exist in this reality all of this just was just a drama. I didn't have anyone... I can't tell my mom because she is already messed up. And friends... She is my best friend 😢. Exam was done I messed it up, I joined one of the best colleges in my country but. Unsatisfied I just moved what I had.About her, I just accepted the fact that it happened and still wanted her in my life. We were still talking and I was getting over her... I went on some dates met some awesome people. It was all nice. UNTILL one day I got a call from her.... She happily told me \"I got back with my boy friend \". She didn't even care about my feelings. Shit stared happening I got into depressed and often get panic attacks...  Dropped out of college. All of a sudden the successful smart guy became nothing.I recently told her not to contact me anymore... I do not feel good. I am hollow. I want to hurt myself for being an idiot. I cry everynight thinking about this.I have no friends, no girl friend , I lost my career. While she is happy... She is really happy. I wanted to say this to someone. I know it will get better with time... But I feel betrayed. I just die and haunt her forever 😭😭😭😭Edit : Hey, People !! it's been few weeks and I am really fine and happy now. I am working on myself, I'm sure that I'll be even more happy in future.Thank you for all your love.Edit 2: Oct 2020Hey people... I was at the lowest point of my life when I wrote this post.it has been few months since I wrote it  so I just wanted to come back and write what is going on with my life... it might help someone who is going through the same situation.In my previous edit I mentioned that I am working on myself, guess what !!! It worked out, I got into one of India's top 10 tech Institute [fyi the previous college that I dropped out of had a national ranking below 50]. I am soo happy that strangers online help me get out of my shitty depression. Now I am kind of scared of girls/relationship..  I have a hard time trusting them... But I'm sure that things will get better with time. I am also planing for migration to another country.

I don't know if you could empathize with me but I often feel severely depressed reading about Islam and its growth in this world. Islam has caused so much harm to humankind and it continues to do so. This is highly depressing.Every day, there are Muslim fanatics either trying to convert non-Muslims (they call them __Kaafirs__) to Islam or kill them in the name of jihad. Muslims do not integrate into the country they migrate to; instead, they try to take over and convert it into an Islamic state. This is why the situation in Europe is so worrying. Angela Merkel started the madness of bringing in hundreds of thousands of 'rapefugees' into the EU and is single-handedly responsible for starting the obliteration of European cultural values. What's even worse is that Muslims outbreed the native population significantly. They don't believe in condoms (supposedly unholy) nor family planning.Britain especially is seriously screwed. There's a jihadist attack almost every other day, Muslim rape gangs molest and rape young white girls and extremists want to introduce Sharia law. They even held a protest in favor of Sharia and displayed a huge banner with the words \"Jesus was a Muslim\".In my home country of India, Muslims are a minority comprising 14% of the population. Many of them are anti-India and pro-Pakistan. They do not tolerate any other religion. It's not safe anymore to practice your religion in or near Muslim-majority neighborhoods. Our government is trying to introduce a law that would grant citizenship to minorities fleeing religious persecution in the Islamic states of Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Indian Muslims are going berserk, vandalizing property and hurting innocent civilians.The purpose of religion is to make good human beings out of us all. In that regard, Islam is failing. I would argue that Islam is a regressive political ideology masquerading as a religion.I have stopped consuming the news. It was degrading my mental health reading and watching all those Muslim atrocities. But even now, memories come back to haunt me. I feel helpless like I can't do anything about it. Politically correct leaders around the world are failing us.So, have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you get out of it and move on?

I have no idea if this is common for people (I'm still new to talking about this shit O.O). Anyhow, I've been depressed for as long as I remember and I was cutting myself for a long time but haven't in a little over 4 years or so. But lately the urge has been a bit too much, I won't lie, it's gotten easier over the years, because I really didn't want to add more scars (I FINALLY started wearing short sleeves and stuff out in public, maybe a year and a half ago).. It doesn't help I don't have any ganja, I live in the Netherlands and the 'coffeeshops' (I still don't know why they call it that, I probably looked it up once but forgot) have been forced to close down due to the pandemic, but ganja was working pretty well for me. Some strains made my anxiety or paranoia worse, or sometimes when I'd smoke too much, but at least 75% of the time it made me feel much calmer and helped me to enjoy my day at least a little, make things bearable.. I also have back pains and other random little pains that I can shrug off when I'm slightly stoned (I rarely get completely stoned, think I might have a high tolerance or something). So anyhow, that sucks. I quit drinking beer a few months ago because it became a problem and so now I'm down to only chocolate which is soooooort of comforting but I can eat an entire bar and then just feel like I'm ready to cry while also jumping all the way to the moon from the sugar rush (I eat very healthy stuff most of the time, so when I eat something chocolaty or sugary it's like.. WOOOOOSHHH!!). &amp;#x200B;And don't get me started on the corona thing T\\_T (don't worry, I got myself started anyway, this is a weird statement why do people make this.. why am I doing it?!) ... anyhow, all those damn idiots hoarding food and toilet paper, my boyfriend finally managed to find some toilet paper today and some dried red lentils (which is one of our staple foods) and it stresses me out so much.. and I worry one of these days we're going to be out of something and we have very little, we've been very low on money these past few months especially (we've never had a lot to spare anyway) and I'm always craving comfort foods and stuff that I can't have and to then run out of basic things is really unpleasant :( &amp;#x200B;Also I just moved from Scotland (my boyfriend and I moved there initially and I was super hopeful and he got a cool job but then he quit and we quickly ran into money problems again and now we had to go back again because things weren't working out and blablabla) and my friends, the only real friends I've made in YEARS, are now all far away.. Two of them are still in the UK (one was going to India but now she couldn't because of virus stuff) and the other is somewhere super remote in Norway (good for him though, I think) and I really miss them every day and I'm not on any social media, I don't have a phone, I only use email (I just recently started posting here on Reddit out of sheer desperation, hi...) to talk to my mom (I don't call my parents cus I rrrrrreeeeaaaally hate phones and especially talking on a phone) so I've been extra lonely.. my boyfriend has to work a lot, especially now because co-workers are getting sick and taking extra measures not to infect people.. because he works with sick kids and nobody can risk infecting them which is another worry of mine! I'm so scared he's gonna catch the virus from some random person in the supermarket or something and then spread it to the kids without knowing it and they could die from it and I honestly don't know if I could live with that..On the bright side, he won't get it from me.. I haven't left the house in weeks, months(?) I don't even know.. I went outside with him, a few weeks ago, to go to the stores.. and I think we went for a walk in the woods once.. Today I stood out in the garden for a few minutes.. but sometimes I get so nervous or scared or both for no good reason that I don't even like being near the windows where people could possibly see me. &amp;#x200B;I'm turning 31 next month... I thought my last birthday was somewhat of a miracle because I used to say I wouldn't make it past 30.. But also.. we arrived in Scotland on my birthday (I even had cake, yay!) and I was so hopeful and optimistic about everything.. Before we left I made some good changes, I was eating well, lifting weights, I was growing my hair and my beard (yeah, I'm a boy, lemme know if I surprised you, cus that might make me smile) both of which were very bushy and full and then I got sick, a week (maybe two at most) after we arrived and was stuck in bed for a whole week or something and it was awful and I fell back into my old habits soon after that. It all went downhill from there. I shaved my beard because it became very annoying while I was sick and struggled to eat, later that year I also cut my long hair after my boyfriend's mother commented on my grey hairs (why do people insist on pointing that out?!) and while I used the excuse of ''I wanted to try short hair'' and told everyone that I would have regretted not cutting it also (which is partly true).. I miss my long hair so much.. it was almost at the longest length I've had before and I really wanted to go beyond that.. &amp;#x200B;Another random annoying thing; my twitchy eye has returned, it started a few years ago and came and went, but it's back now and it really bugs me.. always my right eye, feels like it's the lower right corner but I'm not entirely sure (haven't really bothered looking in the mirror, cus I don't like looking in the mirror half the time ofc).. &amp;#x200B;Anyhow, I gotta eat dinner now and this is probably not a ''little'' rant and I might delete it or whatever later if that's possible.. but I expect it to be buried below the other posts and that's fine with me.. honestly, even if people comment (hi again), what exactly is that going to do for me?

I am from India so like most of Indian kids the problem for me began after i completed my high school (10th standard). I was always interested in arts. Most of it was due to the fact that my mother reads a lot and was a very good painter (stopped after she married). I was an average painter but pretty good with pencil art and cartoons particularly. I also spent a lot of time reading classical literature mainly horror and Oscar Wilde. So, naturally i wanted to take arts as my stream in senior secondary and study English literature. I was good in sports and won a few school tournaments. My results were above average too as i scored 90% so my father decided I must take science and be an engineer. I resisted and try to explain him but he got all fired up and things got physical. Just as i was about to punch him my mom stopped me and told me not to and I couldn't say no. I took science and in a few months decided to prepare for several entrance exams for some architecture schools as it was the closest to being in the creative field since i was never gonna score enough marks to enter a literature school. I cleared the exam too with and all India rank of 4k something which was decent to get me a good private college or the low tier govt institutes. So again it was denied by my father and i was forced to take up engineering in computer science as i was good in programming. It's all been downhill from there. I smoke heavily and drink more than i should. It was worse while i was in college where I had my first meal in a bar before i drank to the point i felt nothing. I could walk easily to room no matter how much i drank and sleep in peace. I stopped that and switched to weed. Till then I had performed horribly but managed to perform well in my major project and even presented it in a conference. After that I've felt nothing. I don't have a job. I don't feel like studying, I don't read anymore,  Whenever i pick up a pencil i feel like my hands are gone. I can't draw shit anymore. I used to draw a line and then another and it used to fall together into a picture but now i can't even draw a decent landscape anymore. My hands start shaking and i can't feel the picture in my head anymore. I used to have a journal which I've stopped updating around 2 years ago so i don't write anymore too. My Les Paul has been lying in a corner and i noticed today that the frets have been completely damaged by fungus. I wake up everyday, cook my breakfast (my only meal), take a bath, smoke weed till midnight while listening to some punk, grunge and motorhead.  I'm tired of  telling myself that you're a man, deal with it. I pushed all my friends who tried to help me away from my life, broke up after school and never felt sexually anything after that. I feel like all my feelings are dead except the anger. I close my eyes and all i see is red which feels darker than black and feel this constant stream of rage and all i want is to break things or whip myself with a belt. I hate everyone around me and now I don't even go to birthdays or any occasion as I'm sick of trying to act normal and fit in. I just sit in my room and stare into my laptop screen playing games like a zombie, some days drunk and mostly stoned. Now even these two don't work for me and I'm thinking of getting into going heavier stuff.

Are you stupid?”“YOU FORGOT TO TAKE YOUR LAUNDRY OUT AGAIN???”*yes in all capsThis happens in a group chat that everyone sees.I’ve told my best friend how I feel and while she says she understands, she obviously sticks up for him a bit because she sleeps with him, spends every day with him, has feelings for him, etc.She chalks a lot of it up to his cultural background (he’s from India) and says that he’s just like that, but I often feel as if she dismisses the fact that I don’t even like being around him because I feel he despises me and thinks I’m a lazy idiot, despite knowing that I have mental health issues.A lot of the things have been more minor, too.

(I still don’t know which I am guilty of, he’s said I do both all the time)Accidentally nudging the little handle on the bathtub once.Idk, maybe I am really a shitty person to live around and be with, but i feel like I’ve put more effort in the last year than I was before, with having real jobs and paying bills and such, but it’s still a daily struggle to even exist, and I just want to not wake up to someone berating me in all caps.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1582857651.0, "author": "BredCatXD", "title": "I cut down on meds few weeks ago", "selftext": "I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years. My mom and I often take a journey (5 AM in the morning) by train of 3 hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. The doctor fixes the day for us to visit him. It causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in India. Not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line (in the hospital) just to see the psychiatrist. My mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. Instead she does it herself. You won't believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy (maybe because it's a famous hospital around here). When I visited him, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti-depressant named, BUPOZEN 150mg tablets. I have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for 3 years. My parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. They aren't even aware that this tablet is a anti-depressant. The doctor never tells us about it. Just expects us to believe him and take the doses daily. I never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.All these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it  after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them? Many times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.I even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist.  Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you  don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.Now coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them. I think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants? I'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds. I'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor?

This seems to spiral out of control despite things on paper looking good.  I'm a male in mid 40's, have a wife, two teenage kids, steady and well above average paying job with a lot of freedom to set my own hours, routines and focus areas. I'm healthy and fit, not good looking but not ugly either, have a few long-time friends that I actively communicate with electronically and every few months we get together to hit the bars and shoot the shit. I live in a nice spacious house, have very manageable mortgage and leftover money for travel and stuff.Sounds great, right? Then why do I feel like shit and that this is a pointless struggle of a life that has seen it's apex and this decaying body and mind on it's way towards the inevitable nothingness. That I guess could sounds like an average middle age crisis that ppl I fix by buying a motorcycle or whatnot. I might just as well find my fix by killing myself to be done with the dark thoughts and existential crisis that seem to just get worse by the year.Don't take this as a suicide watch thingy, we're not there yet. But for the first time in my life last night I started evaluating that as one potential solution. I'm a long way from it as I feel a lot of responsibility not to cause misery for my family but since things escalated like this I thought it's time to do something which triggered me to write here.I'm a long time reddit lurker but never had an account until now. Guess that's kinda selfish to only contribute when in need of a community that might be going through similar thoughts. I could talk to my SO and friends about this but I don't want to be a drag. And once I voice out such deep shit there is no taking it back and I'm afraid of getting branded as that \"sad and depressed\" guy. Have shared some thoughts with my SO but as this kind of shit is not something she can relate to I don't want to get her concerned. And I do know my friends go through some deep shit every now and then, but prefer to keep our interaction as something fun instead of it turning into suicide / depression hotline.Thinking about the potential reasons that might drive this decline towards the abyss I have self-analyzed a few potential reasons and characteristics that might play a part:I am quite an introvert and the older I get the more social anxiety I seem to experience. I can do just fine in a social setting with colleagues and such and I think I could even be considered funny and good company. But that's a role I play that consumes a lot of energy and I would rather just mope out of the way. I seem to also have a tendency to over-analyze the perception others have of me and how my behavior and verbal output affects it. This makes interactions a chore I need to pay attention to and has kept me totally out of social media as it's all about keeping appearances.Secondly I drink and smoke weed on recurring basis. Have done so more or less since my mid 20's. I try to keep to weekends for the most part, but then I do get toasted (while keeping it under control in a sense that I'm still presentable in front of the family). I think this might have had a detrimental effect on my mental health and reinforce my social anxiety, but it's hard to quantify as this shit is not an exact science. But at the same time this combo has brought me such an amount of pure joy and the absence of the depression and existential crisis haunting in the background. And the thought of stopping it gives an outlook of a life so bland that might just not be worth living.Thirdly I'm a 'fake'. I have always found it hard to share what I 'truly feel or think' which probably comes from over-analyzing of others perception I mentioned earlier. I actually am not sure myself what I truly feel, think or want at this point. I'm not sure who the fuck I actually am. It's just noise of million things bouncing in my head. Have done some meditation to overcome this and get pretty decent experiences out of it, but for some reason I struggle to persist on that. I have used bunch psychedelics and MDMA back in my 20's and with that the fundamental self reflections, reconstruction and feelings of universal love are quite familiar. This seem to make meditation pretty easy with some help from waking up app and such. But still it's hard to stick to it. Maybe I'm afraid of discovering things I don't want to and finding myself in a cave somewhere in India with just a cane and rags on my back.Surprised if some one made it this far through this wall of text and what I to easily tend to characterize as a big man whining and first world problems. And interestingly enough it seems that suicide rates of well-of countries go up with age while in developed countries the trend is the other way around.Would be great to find people to reflect thoughts on this. Perhaps in this thread but also through private messages.Even as I am about to submit this I wonder what will people think..

Been a long time lurker, first time poster.I would like to start by saying that I feel like I've been depressed for the last 5 years or so. Currently 20, hitting 21 in May. Honestly speaking, I don't even imagine reaching the year 2020. I'm not suicidal, just to let everyone know, though like almost everyone on Earth, I have had lots of suicidal thoughts. I have been just going through life on autopilot for the last few years, so anticipating the mere concept of a future has been far from my most recent thoughts.I feel so emotionally numb and yet also feel like I might break down crying every waking moment. Sleep, video games and junk food have been my drugs of choice for the past few years, so as you can imagine, I am not physically in great shape. Sorry to be going off on such a huge tangent, but I would like to give some background information about me.I live with my parents in the USA for about one year now. We immigrated from a third world country close to India. Grew up in an extremely religious Muslim background, though I am an atheist now as of 2 years ago. My parents do not know this, and to keep the peace, I go along with their requests regarding religion for the most part. Both of them have M.Sc in Psychology and yet do not understand the concept of depression properly. I have tried talking to them quite a few times about my current condition, but all they do is compare my upbringing to those of people in worse countries. Since coming here, most of my time is divided between going to classes and work, so I have had no time for social activities. Also, the social activities people partake in all over the US is forbidden in Islam, so essentially I am completely alienated from these kinds of activities. My mother is always worried that American influence will 'corrupt' me, so I have to stay away from most social occasions in general. I have no one to talk to, and no one to describe my state to. This subreddit is the closest thing I have ever had to bring able to relate my experiences. All of you people who comment on these posts to support people, I salute you. To me personally though, not trying to offend anyone here, it feels kind of patronising. What I am trying to say is that I am emotionally vacant and bordering on the side of insanity, though I do not take that lightly. I know I am in a great place of living, living a life far better than a lot of people around the world, and so it always feels like my problems are no big deal compared to other people.I have self-sabataged so much that it is not even funny. I am a huge failure in life, social, physically, mentally, academically as well as in being a good son. My parents work their asses off so that I can lead a good life, and yet all that goes through my head are my stupid small problems. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Everytime I get motivated to be better, it is almost always immediately followed by a surge of demotivation from my mother's comments. I wanna be a good son and human being who is able to help people, and not an emotional b***h who can't do anything but whine. But, I just wanna be held in someone's arms and be told that it is ok to cry my heart out and that my problems are not dumb or miniscule. I think we all want that.

It becomes really hard to get out of bed and do basically anything. Sometimes I stay in that bad place for weeks feeling helpless.

ANYTHING! BRUSH YOUR TEETH! RIGHT NOW!\"But even that has stopped working for the most part. I feel an immense loss of control over my actions and habits.

She's from another country and in that culture men don't show weakness and talk about feelings. This girl is not like the vast majority of women there (because she simply doesn't like these old gender roles) and even said to me early that she love that I am a guy who can show emotions, cry if I have to and not as most guys who try to be macho. But of course her being raised in this culture, even though she doesn't like this cut off emotions/play tough attitude that's how she's borned and raised.I have been suffering from recurring depressions since I was young (now almost 40). Tried all kinds of medications and therapy but nothing has really helped. My previous girlfriend wanted me to talk about how I feel so I'm used to that, but still doing it on this level I've done I will never ever do if I fall into depression again. A problem is that the depressions has led me into severe self hate, and I read out old conversations and it was painful to see how pathetic I acted. Even the smallest things I reacted to like the world was going under. I told her how my life sucks, how I am bad in this and that way. Really stupid and the last thing you should tell your girlfriend, especially early in the relationship.She had never experienced depression and because she had a tough childhood in a poor country I can really understand how pathetic this must have looked. Anyway, my dream is a house on the countryside and I had the chance of my life with this girl. She wanted to move with me to a house and I found a dream house for a very good price. But my fear and doubts made me hesitate and when I finally made a bid it was too late. She later changed her mind and wanted to stay in the city were we live but later I got a second chance because she was up for it again. But I was too picky with house after missing out the dream house and she got fed up with this.Things went worse and worse, I got on sick leave by the time she moved to me. She is super social and positive and this is exactly the kind of girl I want, and especially her. But my negativity, criticism and judgemental behavour made her move further and further away from me. I was never bad to her but depression can get you self absorbed so I overlook her needs and didn't do the things I should. I am a very kind and caring person otherwize (many even say that I'm too kind), but again the depression made me self centered. I only visited her home country once, I didn't help her out that much as I should with learning my language and other things. She didn't know people (obviously) when she moved here and even though we did a lot of things like travel, partying, creative things etc I understand she was feeling alone. Now she has a circle of friends through her job.She did bad things too, like going behind my back, ignoring/rejecting me a lot. She's not a talker and I think she suffers from some problems herself (she can cut off her emotions completely, she has a huge fear of abandonment etc). It was very hard to talk about issues because she basically always saw it as me \"fighting\" even though I was calm and just tried to solve things. She had trouble with understanding why I didn't want to join on all these parties - because when I did I was always social. She called me insecure for not wanting to join and that made me feel insecure and it came to a point when I isolated myself, even at work.Otherwize I am actually a confident as a person. I have mental strength from coping with depressions for so long but overworking just made me fall into the rabbit whole before I could see it coming and stop it. Before I was suffering from severe OCD but I beat it myself with mindfulness and exposure. I am not scared of exposure and always want to improve myself and get better and better.8 months I got diagnosed with ADD which was the reason for depressions and anxiety all the time - hence no other medication worked. I have become better and better - more and more social. But it was too late. A lot of trust issues led to this led to that. And she broke up 2 days before Christmas after me talking her into trying again 3 times during 1,5 month when she said it was no idea because it won't work. We're fine now but it's hard to see her date guys while we still are living under the same roof (only for one more week though).But, she told me that if I only got that house all had been different. If I only had proposed to her. If I only this and that. I was angry at her for some time because how cold hearted she acted post breakup but when I read our old conversations I understand how difficult it must have been for her. And reading her messages when SHE was the one that really pushed us into buying that house (which today I regret I didn't do and can't help but continue dwelling) is painful. I won't do it again but cannot forgive myself that I did it. That I lost the chance of my life to be with this amazing, loving and worry free girl.Also before the breakup I booked an appointment for couple therapy. I hoped that she could get perspective and see her faults too, and see that we actually could fix this. Unfortunately the session was very unfair. It was mostly about my depression and it all made it sound like we were so different persons and she believed it so much that she told me after coming out from the building: \"Thank you for taking me here. Now I know I made the right decision!\". And she wasn't angry at me or anything, she just said it because she was happy to \"finally understand it.\" She even told her workmates this and I hate that I took her there because again it was unfair. I am not the person I used to be, I have changed to much and continue to do so day by day even though it's hard as hell all this.And the thing is when I am not depressed (and now after I got the right medication) we are a super great couple. We are like soul mates and we said it before. And now I am even more a person that fits even better with her than before, but I know she only thinks of the bad times because it makes it easier for her to move on. Fuck, it's hard. I even remember her telling me that she told her mom when meeting me that \"this is the man I am going to marry\". And that night we kissed and continued to say \"I love you, I love you\" to each other the whole night while looking in each other's eyes. It's so hard to think about this, it's true pain.I have changed a lot and she told me that too. Since I got the medication for ADD I haven't been depressed a single second and no pathetic things like how I hate myself, how I suck, how I have no friends (shit, can't believe I sad/wrote this). I have become more worry free thanks to her but there are still a lot to work on and I will become the best I can be. I will go on a trip to India for a month now to expose myself for my fears and become even more worry free (trust me, it's not because I want her back - I want to become more like that for myself). The thing is that she's into law of attraction, meditation, yoga and so on. I have been into meditation and mindfulness a lot before and like these things and will now try to dive even deeper into it. But it' hard with this trip because being honest. The reason I first decided to do it is to prove to her that I am independent and can follow through something like this, not just being something I say I will do. And the reason I choose India was partly also because it's her dream country and I wanted to impress her I think (being in love make you do crazy stuff).aI know the probabilities that we get back together is low even though we said only a couple of days ago that we will see later on. She said that maybe we can start dating again in the future and in that case just skip the past and start all over. But I can't stop dwelling the past, how I lost this chance. How I could be so stupid, scared of change. How I couldn't see what I had.How do I forgive myself for loosing this one in a million girl? How to I stop dwelling? I really need help.Thank you &lt;3", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1580089160.0, "author": "NuttyMcNutbag", "title": "Corner turned.", "selftext": "Just spent a month in India.

I am now 38 years old and 1 year ago after mental breakdown due to stress they finally took my case seriously. I've tried all medications in the book; SSRI/SNRI/TCA etc. Nothing really helped, and these depressive episodes has really fucked up my life in so many ways.Friends that got tired of me, missing out on stuff and broken relationships. The last one broke up with me 3 weeks ago after 3 years. We had a LDR for 1,5 years before she sold here apartment in her home country and moved to me. She is the opposite and has no problem of letting go, making decisions, dealing with possible bad outcomes from them. She is a genuine happy and positive person.We had a sessions today with a couple therapist and everthing was so clear. The reason for the relationship with this wonderful lovely woman broke apart because of my damn depressions. I hate them and they made me loose this gem. After finding out that it was actually ADD I suffered from I got ADD medication (amphetamines) and since then life has changed a lot. It took me maybe 6 months to really adapt, but my now ex girlfriends positive mindset and this medication has changed me to become so much better.However the depressions has shaped me in many ways, and even if I'm not depressed anymore the mindset of the depressed me is still there. The dwellings, the doubts, the fears, the \"what if's\". It was so obvious today at the meeting and especially after. I can't stop blaming myself for letting this happen. My dream is a house on the country side and I even bought a house but changed my mind in the last second, lost 15.000$. I should just have gotten that damn house and I would have lived there now with this wonderful girl.I hate who I was and even if I'm not the same person I can't help feeling pathetic because I was like that. Afraid of everything. And I need to be able to let go. Let go of what has been and start moving forward without looking back. I HAVE to stop the dwellings, they are haunting me. I close my eyes and see this house and us living there, every fucking day. I dream about it and I can't distract me from it. It's was the same with my ex girlfriend, in that case not have the guts to get kids with her. Now, I am happy that didn't happen because we were not a good couple. But that's also the thing, it took me 4 years (out of 10 years together) to finally realize we were not a good couple. Even so I dwelled afterwards for such a long time.I get stuck in my fantasy world and even if the medication helps it doesn't help enough. Nor do therapy or anything else. I have tried mindfulness and it helped me with anxiety, but not with this. And I am serious now, if this won't stop I will kill myself sooner or later.I will leave now for a solo trip to India. I wanted to show my ex that I am capable of making spontanous desicions and be an independent guy (travel alone). India is the country she's always wanted to go to and I think that's one of the reasons I choose that. Now I feel terrible due to the breakup and I really don't wanna go, but I will do it. 4 weeks from now and be away for a month.But I need to change, fundamentally.

Being an Asian my parents had high hopes on me, because society here is entirely different. People value you by your marks, literally everyone asks about your rank.So let me just tell you about JEE MAINS real quick : Over 1.2 Million people write it every year. You can get into prestigious college's through these examinations. The people who get below 10,000 ranks can opt for which ever course they want in any college (National Level). (And yes it's a highly competitive exam). The people who get above 89 percentile of the average score, can be qualified to the next level. It's JEE ADVANCED, about 250,000 people qualify for this exam, and people who get a rank below 5000 in this exam can go to the top most colleges in India.There are 75 questions, in which 60 questions contain negative marking (meaning if you choose a wrong option, your final score will be reduced), and the other 15 questions are integer based. The answer can range from [-99.99 to +99.99].   I have this exam in 10 days from now. Many people prepare for this exam from their 6th grade. (trust me they go through hell everyday) So when they reach this stage they are a little bit different from every one.These ranks define what you are \"in India\".  Nothing else, society here is soo interested in their neighbours kids ranks because now they can laugh at us. You either get a good rank or you spoil your life. That's it. My mom and dad, pay money for my studies, and I feel like I'm not doing justice to them.I know that all my relatives will laugh at me, they discuss about how bad Iam in their homes (100% real). It's like reducing your parents self-esteem, to literal zero.Iam upto no good in this competition, and I feel like I can't do it. (2 years of information in 10 days is not possible). I don't want people saying \"you can still do it stay positive\". Let me tell you it's not possible. No no. I'm just asking for help because I feel like I might kill my self for this stuff.Yes, many students commit suicide for not getting ranks, about 12 people from every state, every year commit suicide due to this exam.Please help meIam not accusing my country, but Iam just reflecting my thoughts on Indian Education System.

I hardly stepped out at all, and being socially awkward, I never made good friends or approached anyone.

Two years have passed since, and it's almost the end of my school life. A lot happened in these two years. I lost all motivation and had breakdowns every night. My grades fell to the lowest, and I failed in every test. My parents were worried sick. I had friends but I never talked. Only listened.I don't know why I wrote all that,sorry.I feel empty and down every day and always make these scenarios in my head where I try to gain attention by taking drastic measures.

I live in south India, where extroversion is valued and introversion is treated almost as mental illness. This is actually not a big problem for me, I can fake extroversion and just blend in to some extent. But lately I have been feeling depressed/sad, this gets worse after attending family functions or events where there are lot of people I know around, interestingly it is not a problem at all if I am around people I don't know at all. I guess I am kinda comparing ,measuring up myself with the rest. I am the kinda person who thinks and advocates to not compare with others, because it gets you nowhere. It's easy to think and be like that for a day or two or maybe a month, but I guess, in the longer run, it is hard to actually implement it. The biggest problem is that I find that I am very different from the world around me, not just because of introversion, but a lot of other reasons too. I like a simple life(i am not being dramatic :), I really do and prefer it that way), just a home, food, clothes and whatever little pleasure I like. But the world around me is not so and as I interact with it (especially people I know), for longer durations, I kind of get depressed/sad, I guess it is because - as you become an adult (I am male 29 now), you would be expected to meet some expectations (i.e getting married, leading a better lifestyle etc.. ), these are the kind of expectations I am not interested in, I would even take off the whole day next to get back to my normal self. **Are there people like me? or am I just the weird/abnormal one?** (I would be happy to know that I am not alone in this). Do you think distancing myself from others is a good idea, not like - going to the desert/woods and living away from society, or completely cutting off from family/relatives, but maybe like relocating to a different country. I don't really like to do that, but if this is a problem of life time, then I guess it is a viable option. And I don't want to change myself, I am proud of way I am(I really am). I am scared about future(how it is going to turn out), life before adulthood is a lot easier.

I’m kinda undecided with what I want to major in, so I just am finishing up some general Ed classes. This past 2 years have been absolutely hell mentally. I’ve been sad, and I keep on getting sadder and sadder every single month. My senior year of highschool, I made so many mistakes that made me a chill and made me extremely insecure. When I was applying to college, I was too afraid of even living with a roommate, cause I was riddled with anxiety and I feared living with a bad roommate. So I decided to live with my sister in her apartment. I was expecting for my first semester to be extremely fun, and I would figure out what I wanted to do, but that didn’t happen. I’ve been more alone than I’ve ever been in my entire life, my anxiety and depression has gone through the roof, and it continues to get worse everyday. I’ve joined clubs and went to some events on campus, but I feel worse every single time I go to them. I regret not stepping out of my comfort zone and dorm, because I could’ve met a bunch of people. Every time I come to my sisters apartment after classes, I feel so depressed. I feel terrible and alone every time I come back here, and I don’t know what to do. Even when my sister comes back I don’t feel better. I’ve tried new skills to get my motivation up, but nothing is working. All my friends are having a great time at their university, and I just want to as well. I also started catching feelings for this girl I used to see back in highschool, and now I feel even worse. Everyday I wake up with chest pains, dreading going to school every single day. Finals week is coming up, and immediately afterwards I’m going to India, and for some reason I’m not even excited to do that. I was looking forward to next semester, but I’m so lost I don’t even know if it’ll be good or just as bad as this semester. I’m constantly worried about the future and I hate it, I just wanna enjoy and live life and I cannot do it, it’s driving me insane.I keep blaming myself because I could’ve made this semester better, and I wanna move past this regret but I keep thinking about it every time. My passions don’t even make me happy, and I feel so lost and sad I don’t think I can carry on anymore. I feel like I’m trapped in this apartment for the rest of my college years, and I really don’t want too. I’d tell my parents I’d like to move on campus, but it’s just too much Money. I have enough to do it for one semester tho, but I don’t know if it’s worth it.I know it’s best to tell yourself it’ll get better, but for some reason nothing has been getting better. I don’t know how long I’ll be able to do this. I never thought about actually killing myself, but the thought of dying doesn’t scare me. I don’t think I have a purpose anymore.I’ve been going to the gym every now and then, but I can’t even eat anymore, and I’m slowly losing motivation to attend the gym. I also wanted to start talking to the girl I like, but I don’t know if I can, and if I do, I don’t know if it’ll lead to anything.I’ve been stressing about my future so much and I don’t want too. I want to just relax and enjoy life, but I cannot even do it for one minute, I always feel like I’m not doing enough.

So, it all started when I was in school in 9th grade and here in India parents wants their children to become doctors or engineers, if it were a middle class family. I was good in maths, so started studying for JEE (Entrance Exam for Engineering in India), but I was not that good. Made it through the examination but my marks and rank were not that good because you see I was kind of distracted in heart. Always chasing the one who never did love me back. After passing through exam. I got a college but it was not good enough. I made friends whom I live very much. I must say, I have group of 18 friends. Although none of them are my best friend. Meanwhile, my relationship with school friends starts breaking apart. Now it's like they don't even remember me. I have tried very much in the beginning but it all fall apart. And now when I need a job. I'm not at all capable of getting one. I apply in job posting online on LinkedIn, their websites but nothing works. Besides this, now I feel like I'm worthless and I'm the only one left in the crowd to get a job. It's stressful. And wait I did not tell you guys one more thing. After I passed the exams, that girl and I started dating but it ended after 2 years because it was long distance and eventually admiration fades with distance. If it was love then it would not have faded. Those were the exact words. \"I don't know but it feels like the love that I used to have for you....just faded with time.\" And then I just started playing 10-11 hours a day to fill the void she created.So this was me, last 5 years of my life.

I hate my life. Mostly non self-made. I have been bullied when I was a child. So, didn't make a lot of friends. I was bullied because I had crush on a guy and to him I looked ugly (I had acne at that time). So, I got threats such as 'I will pour acid on your face. Nevermind, your face already looks like that', 'I will beat you up with my friends near the school gate.' I could not tell at my home because if I did, I would get punished for having crush on a guy. An orthodox Hindu family living in South of India. My mother did not allow me to play outside either. As a result, on my 17th birthday, I had only one girl wishing me. I wanted to become an actress when I was in my 8th grade. My parents found that out and beat me up. Seriously, they did raise both my sisters beating them up too. I recognized their lack of love towards us. They think that spending money on our education and sending us to schools was love. I could never share anything with them. I could never see friends in them. I became very sensitive. I took anything anyone said that was not an insult also as an insult. I developed sleep issues. I went to do master's at one of the IIT's, India's pemier school. At that time, my parents were apparently cheated by my dad's parents. My dad had worked hard for them and is the main reason they are well off financially. They made him sign off his portion of the property to his brother. Just as I was finishing my bachelor's in a useless school and started master's in a premier league school, she kept feeding these thoughts in me about how they are bad, kept on repeating. At that time, I had problems with my advisor and this tied with that lead me to a suicide attempt. After the first week, she would bring up the suicide every once in a while and made my life a living hell. Somehow, I managed with everything and finished my Master's. I got admission to a good shool and an ivy league school in the US. My parents refused to send me until I got married. They even hit me. By that time, I was already in a relationship with a guy from IIT. So, I refused to marry. I said I would leave with the help of my friends even if they don't send me. Eventually, they yielded because they were scared of their image in the society (mainly my extended family). I went to US. My boyfriend stayed in India. I had problems with my advisor again. Then, problems started with my boyfriend We had already slept together by then. He said he didn't want to be with me because I was whining about my advisor all the time. I was at a point in my life where I could not make friends, I seemed to be running into problems with my bosses andy relationship was failing. After begging with him, he reconciled. I visited India in the December of that year. He treated me so well. Again, after returning, I was having problems with my advisor. My boyfriend's mom would call me and make plans about cleaning her house if I were married. This led to fights between me and him. He went to his ex. I got to know about it. I asked him to repay some money he borrowed from me and then move on. His dad picked the call and verbally abused me. Unable to bear these, I told my parents. I took a break and came to India for six months. I was depressed. My parents taunted me everyday saying my depression was self-made. That I chose to be in a relationship etc. They didn't know that I went physical with him at that point. My boyfriend reconciled again. After my leave of absence, both of us went to US (even he got an admission in my school). This time, the wounds we're deep. I couldn't let go. I used to bring up the past. I even said that he would have slept with his mother. He finally hit me, physically abused me. I locked myself in the bathroom. He threatened something and made me come out and he hit me so much. He apologized to me a lot the next day. After a few months, it became hitting me became a regular thing. He would choke my neck etc. Then, I started hitting him. He was talking to his ex again and I asked him to be honest and to split decently if he wants her. He didn't leave the house. He didn't let me leave the house. He would be gone outside for hours with his phone to talk to his ex who was still in India. I got really mad. Once I got drunk and told him that he would go to jail for hitting me and I started hitting him. He recorded it. After that, he hit me black and blue, poured cold water on me, pushed me, didn't let me leave the house. I left the house when he was not watching. I didn't take my specs (can't see without them), no keys, no purse, no phone. He followed me to the nearby park and called cops. The cops initially said they would take him but because I still had so much feelings for him, I somehow, changed things and made them take me instead. My biggest mistake. He did bail me out and all that. He paid the lawyer fees too. Anyway, the hell I was living in only got worse. I forced him to leave the house after that. He would come to my house everyday, used my spare key. I asked him many times to not come and to return my key. He then would call ally friends. After a few months of going through such  events and severe depression, eventually I decided to leave US and he left too. We are from the same city. I still had feelings for him. Up until we returned to India, he said we would get married. As soon as he came here, he dumped, didn't take my calls and everything. Apparently, he was lying about getting married because he was scared I would turn him to cops. I attempted suicide. As he said he didn't want to have anything to do with me. My parents were forcing me to get married and they were calling guys home. I kept telling them that I had a problem. They asked me to think of them as their friends and tell them things. After the suicide attempt, my life became a hell again. Tauntinge of having slept with my ex everyday, spoiling their name in the society, etc. After a few months, my ex reconciled after a lot of begging and everything. The reason I beg him is I don't want to marry another Indian or date another as they take 'not being a virgin' seriously. I didn't want to make the rest of my life a hellhole. A known devil is better than an unknown angel. Even while I was in the US, I tried to move on with an American. However, I remember my dad calling me a prostitute in the past when I had told him that if my relationship with my ex didn't work out, I would find another guy. Currently, I like my job but I don't have good reviews at work. I like what I am doing. I got a chance to go back to US to finish my PhD which I dropped amidst all this chaos and also due to lack of interest in the subject matter. I am torn between whether I should stay in India in a job that I like doing or go back to US and run away from my parents and my ex. I wish to go on dates in the US and get over my ex. Honestly, I want someone who would love me. I don't know if a stranger would accept me and love me. Relationships start with both people being in a good state of mind. I don't really know what to do. I feel like I am going to kill myself in about a month or so. My boyfriend said he would be better off with me being dead. My parents said that it's up to me if I wanted to commit suicide. They said they would lose respect amongst their family members if I died. But, they said it's up to me. What should I do? Should I run away and do a PhD I don't like and find someone who might love me or should I stay in this hellhole and work at a job that I like while having no one to love me?", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1573927466.0, "author": "PontiusPies", "title": "Spiralling down a black hole", "selftext": "I feel like I am spiralling down a black hole.

I’m not sure.I have googled the symptoms and they seem to match, but I’m not a doctor. It just sucks. I wish I could be sure that I’m fucked up coz of how my parents treated me. My parents tell me that they’ve sacrificed their lives for me, spent their retirement funds in my education so that I could succeed. They say I’ll always be indebted to them. I dont feel that way though. They are also the people who didnt let me pursue the course that I wanted and refused to pay for it. I hate myself for that. I hate myself for letting them bully me into it and now I’m stuck in a field that I have to keep on working in to pay my student loans and my family coz they have spent their funds on me and have nothing left. I feel so alone. I feel detached from this world. I feel so unloved. I remember being poor and so we would all sleep in the same king sized bed, all 4 of us. And I’d get pushed out and would sleep half on the bed and half of my body falling out. And I would cry silently every night. And all I could think was of getting away. My parents didnt let go of any opportunity to scold me, beat me, show me how dumb and stupid I was, but barely can I remember them encouraging me. The times they did, seem formal and detached at best. I was expected to function normally no matter what. My brother was born autistic and so he was loved. And I loved him too. But when I would tell them that they were partial to him and loved him more they would tell me that I was jealous of an autistic child and that was bad. That I wanted him to be mental. That I wished he stayed crazy. I stopped complaining after that.I had no friends. Nobody in my class would speak to me mostly. When they did, it was to make fun of me, taunt me, or to just annoy me. I really didnt mind that. It didnt affect me. I liked to read a lot and so I would just keep reading the stories in my english book or get something from the library. I surrounded myself with stories. My parents hated each other and my dad seemingly beat me when he was mad at my mom or they had fought. I would get beat up for talking coz he didn’t feel like it. I got beat up for hugging him coz he had come out of the shower and wanted to pray and me touching him had made him “unclean” and so he couldn’t pray.Several times I got beat up for not studying throughout the day. If my father was pissed  and found me without a book in my hand, I was definitely going to get beat up. When I bring it up now, my mom says thats normal and that every child gets beaten. She says that he spent his retirement fund on my education and that even if I pay him back, I’ll be forever indebted to him. It pisses me off that I will always be indebted to him. It feels like he was wrong and they messed me up and so I dont want to owe him anything. Worst of all, I feel all this talk of me being jealous of my brother turned him against me. We used to be so close. Now he barely talks to me. He started beating me up too a couple of years ago until I moved out. I have always thought that all of this was the reason for my depression. But what if its not? What if I am actually a horrible and self involved person that small things that my parents did for my good, I concocted as negative in my head and am making them evil? I am just not ready to get a verdict from a therapist. Coz I know I am too unhinged. I cant be right when the entire world hates on me right?

Sometimes I just wish I would have just chosen to join a local college, that way, I'd at least have a bubble in which I was the 'smartest'.Before you ask, no I'm not particularly interested in engineering I just chose it because I was relatively good at it and it was also what I was suggested.

I don't know when it started, when I completely fell off the hook, and stopped understanding anything that went on at my tuitions, which were, for an examination known as JEE, being an Indian student from the lower middle class, I started preparing for it officially since 9th grade, which is, the start of middle school. Unofficially, I've been preparing for it my whole life, without knowing I was doing so, and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed doing so. My father, a college professor brought me up free of any \"distractions\" like television and movies, lest I fall off the path and become like the other kids were. I read a lot, in the absence of any other form of entertainment, played on my 3DS, which was a birthday present, which I'd get for a few weeks after my annual examinations and then it'd be confiscated, following which I'd steal it back and play on it all day. Being brought up in a household where every hobby could be monetised and be used to benefit my career, where I'd solve textbooks that were two grades above of me, just to get attention from my father, which is yet an unresolved complex for me, why I'd do all of that willingly only to be thrashed if he caught me with my 3DS or with a comic book behind the textbook I was supposed to be doing. He'd enroll me in courses, I'd excel at them, I'd get rewarded, and I'd be punished if I didn't perform. Upon developing an interest in music, he enrolled me in an academy, and when I scored 80/100 in the initial grade examinations by the trinity board, failing to achieve distinction, he made me clean the car and wash the dishes because that's all I was fit for, in conclusion to those grades. It was just the way it was. Amongst all this, I won awards for debating, quizzing and being actually good at it. I was, an edge above everyone, a peg above all of my peers whom I'd see as dumb and shallow for wasting their lives on going to birthday parties and trying to solve simple linear equations, knowing deep down that I wanted to be a part of it, I wanted to have friends, I wanted to be invited. All this time, I'd whore for attention, I'd be the class clown, I'd fight for no reason just so people would notice me and they did, and not in a good way. All this carried on, after which I dropped out of a public school at the behest of my father and joined what they call an open school, where I'd only give the examinations and for the rest of the time, I'd go for coaching and tuitions. My grades started slipping towards the end of 10th grade, it wasn't as if I was slowing down, I still knew more than anyone around me but I couldn't study for some reason, I'd just play on my stolen 3ds all day, and attempt to write a novel on wattpad. I genuinely craved for a childhood friend, which I still do, someone who's been with me through thick and thin, someone who'd call me up and ask me how things were but that was something that my father didn't allow, guys from class calling at home to talk about anything except studies. He still gives me shit about how my then-friends didn't talk about anything academic on the way to the mall, where he took me for my 14th birthday. I dropped out of a school where I had to attend among other kids and thought, \"oh well, I have all the time in the world now, I can finally start studying and get into what, IIT Delhi!\"Forward to two years and a few months and I'm at the bottom of everything, I failed to score on every single avenue I was presented, the boards, JEE, grade 5 piano, everywhere.This journey, which I'm retracing as I write this, went from me not understanding shit in class, to me bunking classes to smoke or just fuck around for five hours and then telling myself at night that I'd study tomorrow and make up for it. So I didn't understand shit in my coaching classes, big deal, not a lot of people did, this was a peg above the standard board examinations too. But that was all I had, and to my misfortune, I was in the top batch which I secured through my former prodigal self, to whom my school teachers would say that I'll definitely get into IIT, or even MIT, and I wish I hadn't believed them, cause believing that I could sail through without knowing the syllabus or even the name of the chapter that was coming in the monthly test the coaching would hold was a huge mistake, obviously. I wasn't getting shit as to what went on in that classroom, that premier batch of the best coaching institute of that city where a lot of kids, like me, had dropped out of normal school. I couldn't study at home, I don't know why, just found it difficult to look at the book without feeling sleepy or just being out of it in general, and I'd waste 23 hours of my 24 hour day doing nothing, sleeping, listening to music, trying to look good, but hey, I didn't go to school, who was looking anyway? As it should've been, I just rolled downhill, carrying my grades with me, realising that I wasn't that smart after all, there were 40 other kids like me in that 50 student batch, but they were studying and they were scoring, I wasn't, I was pretending to understand and act smart so I could live up to my previous reputation as a fucking prodigy which I slowly realised, I wasn't. I wasn't anything of that sort, I was on my way to be one of those kids I used to laugh at, who would find regular curriculum difficult, which I'd breeze through. This carried on, 11th grade passed, I started dating someone from my batch, cheating my way through every test they held so my father won't turn my life upside down, for which I needed to remain in the top batch, where the founders of the coaching taugfht. 12th grade started, I was still where I started, at 0, with an year left, and the teachers would say that it was enough to score well, if you studied for 10-12 hours a day, but hey, I wasn't studying for 10 minutes! Every night, I'd think that I'd study the next day, fix everything, and go where I wanted to, which was, IIT, and even that dream escalated downwards, from the best, to the second best, to the third best, and finally, any above average engineering college because fuck, I was nothing, nada, I had no idea what they taught me in those two years, and it was all gonna come in that dreaded examination, which was, in January 2019. In August 2018, I made a post on Reddit asking for help in studying, asking for someone who would sit me down and make me study with them, and the most sane advice I received was to throw my phone away, which is, again, stolen from confiscation, cause hell, I wasn't allowed a small Nokia, lest I talk to me friends when I'm supposed to be studying. To throw my phone away and spend every waking hour studying, which I didn't do. I'd still watch movies all day, sleep, or cry because I wasn't studying and everyone was and my future was in flames. All the while, I was dating her, and I must say that her presence was extremely needed, she studied all day, talked to me at night, made time for me since like me, she didn't have school either and helped me study. Not wanting to disappoint her like I was disappointing everyone around me, I'd lie to her about how I was studying and how everything was good, and it carried on. I didn't know when and why, the pressure of seeing my future burning down before my eyes got too much and I started to cut. I had self harmed before, in 9th or 10th grade but this was unlike it, I loved the feeling of making cuts on my thighs with a box cutter and feeling my wounds burning as blood dripped down. Once, trying to explain why I found it so hard to study, why I couldn't pay attention to anything study related, I went on Google, and like any self diagnosis, it was errored, pointing me towards ADHD. I told my mom, she asked her brother who's a child specialist at some private hospital, who said that if I had ADHD, the symptoms would've shown themselves sooner, and not in high school. Some time later, again, I googled the reason as to why I slept so much, when I'd always been a light sleeper, why I never felt happy, why I couldn't focus, and there it was, depression. I didn't give a shit, I dismissed it completely, being surrounded by people on social media who would talk about depression as if it was a statement, and I thought to myself that this wasn't shit and I wasn't supposed to blame my inability on something I don't have, hypochondria is not something that befits a student. I had a friend, he was somehow going through the same, with exactly the same premise as me, we'd hang out, he got me smoking until I couldn't stop, we'd talk about how shitty everything was late into the night, he'd cut way more than I did, and time passed. He visited a therapist, somehow convincing his parents, came back and showed me a prescription for Toficalm and Bupron, his diagnosis reading \"depression, ADHD symptoms and NSSI\". He studied a little towards the last few months, got into a below average college, and is now out of state. We don't talk anymore, and no one around me, including my then-girlfriend liked his presence.In March or so, I begged my mom to let me see a therapeutic presence so I could ask, or confirm, because I hadn't yet started believing that I was depressed, because as of now, almost everyone I know is supposedly depressed, no one has friends, everyone has a therapist, even 13 and 14 year old girls, I don't believe them, the same way I didn't believe myself either. She took me to see her friend, who, after everything, told me to drop the whole engineering dream. I told her I didn't want to, she told me that I didn't want it. When everything was over, in May, my father sat down in front of me and cried about how seeing me fail hurts him too, as much as it hurt me. Obviously, in the absence of my passable grades, I was offered two choices, to drop an year, and reattempt the next, in 2020, or to pursue English honours in his college, under the Ward Quota, which still isn't an option, which never was, even though her friend encouraged me to take it and go out there and enjoy. I willingly accepted the drop, seeing it as a chance to turn things around and fulfil my IIT dream, and join my then-girlfriend where I wanted to go, IIT, where she went, with all her insane dedication towards studying and being successful. This was, in May, my birthday month, the lowest point I've had, with the absence of friends, surrounded by the people I disappointed, with no one to call me except relatives, who'd ask me how I scored. My father's friends, who had seen him bring me up, strongly disapproving all along, convinced him to take me to a counsellor, or a therapist. It happened, I told her about me cutting, smoking, and everything bad in my life, and how I still wanted to study and do engineering. She, from there, recommended us to jointly see her and a psychiatrist, because, as per her, after 8 sessions, I was, clinically depressed. My father refused, firmly believing in a no drug approach, yelling at me as to why I can't talk to him about it, why I couldn't just study, why highschool was such a big fucking deal. This carried on until my mom begged me to stop destroying the family, because supposedly my father felt betrayed and hurt due to my inability to open up to him or spend time with him, or even be alone in a room with him for five minutes, and he was taking it out on her and my sister, while I'd stay in my room all day, sleeping or watching Bojack or some other show. The psychiatry never happened, the counsellor told my parents about my cutting since I was 6 days away from being 18, technically being 17 and posing a danger to myself. They cried outside the hospital, made me promise that I'll never cut again while my therapist told me to start off small, by studying thirty minutes a day, she made my dad enroll me in a couple tuitions, where I'd be forced to study and so he did. I still didn't study, I lied to her about doing so, and she admitted that I can't be put on any kind of medication due to my father being firmly against that. After this was over, she told us that our next appointment was in two weeks, which never happened, because the first question that my father asked me when I asked to go was why I still needed it, why I still couldn't talk to him about about whatever problem I was facing, and again, why highschool is so difficult. Once or twice, he'd bring up my self harm, telling me that it's the sign of a weak man, following which I'd go to my room and let my anger out by sleeping, which I did after every stressful situation, sleep it off, smoke, repeat. Things got better with time, I stopped cutting, I started to understand what went on in the classroom, filled with the same kids I looked down upon a few years ago, who struggled with the same curriculum as I did. I still couldn't study at home, unless it was homework, and I couldn't stop smoking, though I lessened it significantly. What still ate me up, and still does was the fact that I wasn't self studying. Even an hour a day. I'm no longer anywhere near intelligent like I was, I'm slow and dumb, I can't make do without self studying. I'm cheating on the weekly tests they hold, I'm failing at the test series my father has made me join for JEE, thankfully, due to which he has accepted that it's way out of my league and he shouldn't expect results over on that avenue. Anyway, June-August, this carried on, I wasn't really happy, as, again, time was running out and still is but at least I wasn't in that phase, the cutting-smoking-repeating-never feeling happy tirade. Come September, the pressure builts in with about three months to go, during which I need, need to study and finish the stack of unopened textbooks lying in front of me. I need, to stop cheating, I need, to start, fucking, studying. And then she breaks up with me, citing the absence of time to talk, because even though we were in the same city, it was more of a long distance relationship as I wasn't allowed to go out for anything except my tuitions. My one and a half year, stable and happy relationship, ended, because it wasn't fulfilling. She couldn't find time to call me for days on end, being in one of the best colleges in India and studying and excelling, while trying to live the life she missed out on in highschool, with proms and parties rightfully taking priority over me, leading to fights and guilt and eventually, her telling me that she's not in the headspace for a relationship, with no time to date.I'm scared, I'm scared that this will all end up as a repeat of the last year, I'm scared sick that I'll fall back into that phase and yet, yet I can't study. Yet, I'm lying in bed all day, calling her up, with her screaming at me to move on and let her do so too, to get on with my life and study, instead of throwing it all away. Eventually, I convinced her to let this be a break for the relationship and not a complete end, because God knows I can't let her go, the shitty fucking person that I am, I don't want her to move on, I want her to stay. But I know that she'll leave soon enough, as we're still fighting like we did, about how she could spend 5 hours at a party but how an hour is a lot for her, when it comes to calling me, because I'm just there on a screen. I understand how selfish I'm being, how much guilt I'm putting her through with her thinking that I'm not studying because of this, but I couldn't study before and I can't study now and I don't know what to do. The relationship is beyond saving, with her developing into something she never was once college started, acquiring anger issues and a tendency to be a prick and tell me that she's sorry later, after she's told me to stop acting like a kid and study for fucks sake, and get on with my life. She doesn't know that I wasn't studying while she was there, and I can't tell her that either, like I couldn't tell my therapist. The relationship is over and I'd love to move on but hey, she had friends who took her out the day she broke up with me, I don't have a single person who texts me first. The ones I've talked to, about the break-up have told me to move on, which I know is what I should do, but again, I can't. I'm slipping back, I purchased a new box cutter, like the one I used to cut my thighs with, I can feel my day just being wasted, I can't cry, I just can't, I can just be a sad piece of shit and watch the sun rise and fall and I watch Netflix and live on a diet of unhealthy proprietary food, with Instagram and Reddit sprinkled in between amidst me running my hand over my thigh, feeling the marks I made some time back. There's a well of guilt in me, eating me up, for all the sacrifices my parents have made for me, and how I've done nothing but disappoint them, which I shall do again, in a few months. And yet, yet, I can't study, I can't pick myself up and sit at my desk and try to study without getting distracted, and then doing anything, anything, except studying. I miss her so much it hurts, I can't let her go, I'm just wasting my life doing nothing, not even being happy about anything. I'm just this sedentary sad piece of shit who sits in bed all day and holds his head in his hands at night, not knowing what to think, missing his ex girlfriend, not wanting to admit that his happiness did indeed rest on her presence. I can feel myself going back here, and I don't want to. I don't wanna fail again, I can't fail again. I need to move on from her, and I need to do something about my life, and I need to be happy as I do it. When she was sad, she'd study furiously, she'd engage herself in productivity, slowly not feeling my absence and then being fine a few days later, surrounded by friends. I wanna be like her, I wanna study 15 hours a day, and I don't wanna be sad and most of all, I don't wanna slip back into that hell. I've already cut on my thigh with a blunt pair of scissors, I don't know if I'm depressed, but I'm acting just like I was then, and the sadness has increased exponentially with her leaving. It's dumb, it's so fucking dumb, I'm 18, it was just a teen relationship that didn't carry through and yet it's breaking me, but who am I kidding, I wasn't studying before her, now that she's not here anymore, I'm becoming more and more depressed, like a normal person does after a break up, coupled with loneliness, guilt, and the crippling knowledge that I'm going nowhere and that I serve on purpose to anyone, even myself.I don't wanna start cutting again like I used toI don't wanna smoke everyday I don't wanna be sad all the time I don't wanna waste my life like this, at a crucial point like this, my last chance at a good engineering collegeI'm tired and I don't wanna kill myself, which sounds like a great option, but I know I can't do that.Please help, tell me what I should do, anything, to just get out of this and move on and do something with my pathetic existence.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1568865753.0, "author": "sausalito7", "title": "35, turning 36 in a few months and trying every day", "selftext": "To be better than before And I don’t know if I’mSucceeding.

I feel so useless and pointless and don't know where to go with my life anymore.When my father started showing signs of dementia, I was a junior in high school. The reality of the situation didn’t hit me until freshman year in college. At the same time, my grandfather in India was ill, and my mother spent most of her time outside the country. In terms of paying tuition, I was set. When it came to living expenses and emotional support, I had no one.I didn’t think it was physically possible for the human body to shut down. I didn’t know that a human was capable of crying for hours without calming down. I was surprised that I could lie in bed for hours, wide awake, without having any will to move.After conversations with my therapist at the time, I speculated that my growing isolation was my fault. I didn’t reach out to people. I decided to change that. I reached out to acquaintances, people I just met, everyone. Many of them took advantage of my emotional vulnerability. And one night, someone took advantage of me physically. My school was under Title IX investigation. Our disabilities services was inefficient and unhelpful. Professors and classes were known to give students zeroes on exams, even in the event of an ER visit. I would have no institutional support.In the process, mutual friends either cut me off or refused to stand up for me. All my relationships became strained, as individuals who claimed to support me were suddenly “too busy” to help. The one thing folks don’t tell you about sexual violence is that the event itself isn’t the most traumatizing part--it’s the aftermath: the victim-blaming, the shame, everything.I was traumatized for years. I can count on one hand the number of people who stood by me in undergrad. My brain shut down. I skipped classes out of fear that *he* would be there. I avoided libraries out of fear of running into *him* I chose isolated spots just to cry myself to calm. It’s astonishing how much time one can spend in front of a book only to absorb nothing when the mind is repeating a bad memory. I was surprised that I didn’t fail out of school.I couldn’t tell my parents. But when they asked me why I wasn’t applying for medical school straight out of undergrad, I could only open my mouth and say nothing. I could not say that sexual violence had resulted in multiple Cs on my transcript.I said I needed some time. But that’s when I started to fall apart bit by bit. I took pills hoping to go to sleep and never wake up. I shaved so heavily into my skin I drew blood. I sent rants to my friends, pleading for an escape. None of what I did worked. I knew I had to pursue more education if I wished to go to medical school. A master’s degree posed more financial use over a post baccalaureate program. I went to graduate school, got straight As, and applied again.But every single time I applied, every time I was denied an application due to my academic record, every time I was asked why I had academic difficulties only to burst into tears...I remembered that night and what followed. While I can work on healing, medical schools will never forgive me for what happened.

I was so depressed and it became part of my life I stalked her from different account everyfuckenday and keep going on with my life 27x7 depressed.I also noticed  sad posts on her profile then somehow I found that there is no other guy,  after 9 months (december 2018) she messeged me and we started talking again as a friend (I started to feel great).on Fifth day I told her I still have feelings for her and boom I was blocked again.Everything fell apart. It was like I came back 9 months in a time machine. Again same feelings same depression and anxiety.I joined gym in January and keep going on with my life, slowly depression became sadness and stalking was there too.In February 2019 her best friend J added me on Instagram and we started talking day &amp; night, but I convinced her that her friend was wrong in this and she has mental tortured me.In May V unblocked me and wished me happy birthday, this time I blocked her I don't know why (I was not over her tho).On a good day june 29th 2019 I messaged her and we started to talk and we met same day as she was in my area.  It was not good as those glorious times but I was glad that we are friends. meanwhile I sometimes talk with her friend J too, she asked me how is it going betweet me and V and me, I told her that she don't talk with me that much and is there another guy, she told me there isn't. On August 5th It was V's birthday and my first day at college for masters we met and had a good time and in the evening when I reached home she messaged what was I asking to J. I said \"didn't she tell you what was I asking her\"?and boom I was blocked again. I checked insta facebook, phonecall was blocked too. J SHOWED MY MESSAGES TO V.

I can't go through all this again and again. She said \"so I should talk to you just because you become sad when I don't talk to you. What kind of excuse is this?\" I said don't talk to me just don't block me. That's what happened.She blocked me on whatsapp after some days maybe my DP was hurting her eye.But this last month became really hard for me this time its worse than last 2 times, I'm getting anxiety attacks. I read old chats I'm am not able to delete them coz what if she comes back and everything became like good like it used to be ?Instead of helping me J told me to forget V. My friends also say that.

It's hard enough to understand myself. Ever since I was a kid it's like I've been spectating my own life. Things always seemed to happen around me and I never seem to have any control. I was diagnosed with ADHD but my family didn't really believe in the diagnosis, and so I've never received treatment for it or anything.My parents are from a small village in India, even though I was raised abroad. My schooling was British, but when I got home I lived in a traditional Indian household. My sister assimilated pretty well but I never quite did. My sister was younger so every time my parents made a mistake with me, they could fix it by the time it came to her. Like when I was in Year 2 and our school held a 70s disco for the grade. I told my parents about it and they made me go in a costume from a South Indian 70s movie. I got bullied like crazy for that, because most kids just wore normal clothes. My parents had gotten an arranged marriage when they were young, and they always resented each other since they had nothing in common. My dad expected my mom to act like a regular Indian housewife, and my mom was always bored and lonely since there were no native Indian people living nearby. My dad usually expressed his anger by smashing things, although he never laid a hand on my mother. The bulk of my problems began when I started my GCSE's. It's the exam we do at the end of the Year 11 with the preparation beginning at Year 10. My parent's told me there was an issue with my dad's job and as a result we would be relocating to India at the end of the year. Unfortunately, due to the way the school systems work, I'd be pushed back 2 years. They said the best thing would be for me to do my GCSEs all in 1 year. It was a pretty bad year as I had to work twice as hard and my teachers made comments about me, claiming I was crazy for the attempt. Some made comments to my face, others behind my back.Without their support I lucked out and my grades were great. However, my parents revealed that the job stuff wasn't as big an issue as they had made it seem. And suddenly I was pushed up a grade and in a class with people who were 2 or 3 years older than me (I also started school a year early). My parents even went into school and chose my subjects without my permission. I only found out because a friend sent me a picture asking why my parents had come into school (I was sick and my mom claimed she was going to the doctor). The next 2 years of school was hell, as I was emotionally manipulated by a crush, my teachers treated me like a joke since I was the \"baby\" of the year group and I hated half my subjects. I spent those years arguing with teachers and my parents, and I always felt isolated. I also did terrible in class. I got accepted into medical school and have been here for the past year, but I'm only here because my parents want more than anything for me to become a doctor. I turned 17 a week before I got here. I was not prepared for any part of all this, and I've been severely depressed for the past year. I gained 16 kilograms in the past year, and I spent days on end alone in my dorm. I've been staying in university all summer to make up for all my setbacks this last year. I've tried, but I just hate my classes and I think I'm gonna fail my final exams next week. I'm torn because I hate it here but I also think my parents will make my life even more miserable if I fail.

He was simply in his own world and so ignorant, never thinking how a child could react to such experiences.These years are a humans most critical and formative years neurologically, hormonally and physically. We were an immigrant family, me being the only one born in the US. My sister is 8 years older than me and she had left the house when I was 10. My brother is 5 years older than me and was never home as he was involved in all sorts of leadership activities, eventually becoming a huge entrepreneur. He was always callous and uncaring, especially lately. It all started with my dad.On a normal day, my dad would finish his business and come out of his locked room and want to hug me, but I was totally repulsed by him. I felt he was a scary nasty pervert. Daily, I would sit in the living room armchair feeling frozen and stuck, fully conscious of what he was doing, conjuring up instinctually horrific imagination, and this resulted in me boiling in my own fumes of hatred and contempt towards this man (and the world). I viewed him as a monster, along with his unhinged angry verbal abuse wherein he instigated brutal screaming matches with me and everyone. He would constantly call me retarded, sometimes in public and so loudly and viciously, that people called the police. As I grew up, I tended to refer to him as a psychological terrorist. Everyone in the family endured his temper, but only I endured the psychological destruction of him masturbating in the nearby room to me for 6 years.This had a lot of repercussions, definitely leading up to today.At that time, I didn't speak to anyone about it. I didn't know what to do. I figured no one would care or do anything about it (and I was right, my family knew this was going on). Because I never wanted to ever be in any close proximity, being alone in the car with him was like catatonic anxiety, or go on any family trips, plus I was very cold toward him, I was constantly scolded and resented by everyone. I was deemed an ungrateful brat. It appeared like I was a young teenager with extreme teenage angst and took it out on him. My family were all angry at me. My brother in particular.At age 10, my dad moved into my sisters' room with his giant size desktop, watching the beginning stages of internet porn. I was in the adjacent room and could never sleep, unable to stop thinking about what he was doing and I developed insomnia. For 18 years, I've never slept without sleeping pills.I didn't get my period until I was 16, a cause for concern by any doctor. For the rest of my life, I would get my period about 3-4 times in a year, and that has abundant unhealthy implications. The stress had caused hormonal damage as well.At age 13, I started pulling out my hair (seems like a reasonable response for a girl literally going crazy every day, not knowing what to do, having nowhere to escape to and no one to talk to). As my mom discovered my hair pulling, I explained it to her and she accused me of lying (i.e. that I had really shaved my head). Later, as it became undeniable, her reaction was to call me disgusting. There was no talk about what could have caused this and the idea of getting psychological help was nonexistent. Them being immigrants is not an excuse for ignorance. At the age of 17, I discovered my hair pulling was a condition that had a name... Trichotillomania (TTM) and now I know it is pretty common and it is a kind of self-harm or OCD (similar to cutting or a nervous habit like nail-biting). I’ll have this OCD for the rest of my life. I would clearly choose TTM over depression.I developed depression at the age of 10. As soon as possible, I got a job at 16 so I was able to be out of the house. I made a plan to graduate one year early from high school (by going to night school and summer school) because I was so unhappy, not good at making or keeping friends, anti-social, etc. I wanted to just escape... so I left the country. I saved my money and travelled to India and some other countries for 6 months. No one in my family asked me about university. However, after getting good grades during a year of community college, I was accepted to UC Berkeley and got a degree in cognitive neuroscience. Like a lot of others, I wanted to understand my own mind on a neurological level. After graduating, I moved to Israel alone (another escape from family). But a few years later, they all moved to Israel too.Cut to today, I'm more depressed than ever. My 'leadership' brother is now a CEO of a large company and has refused to use his connections help find me a job for the last 5 years. I believe he still sees me as that 'spoiled brat'. A few years ago, I tried to commit suicide, was in a coma for 2 weeks…..and later, made another attempt to 'escape family' by moving to Italy for 2 years.I confronted my dad around age 27 about his porn addiction once while we were in the car, and because he is so incredibly weird, he responded and said 'empires have fallen and risen over sex.' Whatever that means, it was just a bizarre, sad attempt at an excuse. He and my family think that his porn addiction had no effect on me (or that it shouldn’t have and I should have been stronger) and even when the head of a psych ward said so, they brushed it off as bullshit.I confronted my mom at age 30, asking about what she knew or if she knew (and she did) and tried to explain how it affected my whole life. She simply responded with ' but did he touch you?' From my studies in neuroscience and just from a basic understanding of human development, I know my dad's porn addiction triggered my depression. In my 20's and early 30's, I lived with mild depression but managed it well enough, living a pretty satisfying life. Later, life had hit me with a ton of bricks and it was all downhill from there, where I am suicidal again, my relationship with my family couldn’t be worse and I can barely function. I'm on disability and have social worker(s).My dad has calmed down a lot and has spent significant effort connecting me with all my social benefits for psychological services (to fix what he broke). But there will never be anything as healing as getting the validation from my family that something harmful and, dare I say, abusive was actually done to me by him and I will never get that validation.

At least for me, I don't sleep ok or perform at all because I'm completely in a rut. But I don't see life as not worth living for. I've had terrible days where I've wanted to end it all too but while I'm here let me see what treasures life has to offer. For me, travelling is an invigorating experience that makes me forget everything else that crushes me in life. You don't have to go far. You don't need to go halfway across the world. If you're in a huge country like the US, India or Brazil you have plenty of options in your own country. The experience of another culture, cuisine, arts, music and so many other things keep me alive and make me want to hang in there.If you have no friends, don't worry. Travelling alone can be perfectly safe if you do your research.  Another beautiful thing about travel is meeting other people. They don't ask you about your job or anything else that doesn't really matter. You can be completely open to someone who you may or may not meet again. If you're lonely, travelling can really help you by meeting all kinds of unique, beautiful people.Another bonus from this is that you have things to talk about with people after you're back home. You could feel less shy or anxious because you have a story to tell from your experience. If you're someone who's short of money and struggling to make ends meet, it's ok.

I have always been a rather submissive woman, obeying my parents, doing things properly and I also have this clinical need to please others. I want everyone to like me. My friends, family, everyone. Sometimes it gets super hard. I have always wanted to do something creative in life. But that was suppressed by my need to please my parents and impress my relatives.

It was, they knew, nothing special to look at. The nearest city, Winnipeg, was a four-hour drive away. It lay in the middle of the prairies, and most of the people living there were farmers growing a crop called canola. Its seventeen thousand people worked as hard as they could, but they were still struggling. When the canola crop was good, everyone did well—the local car dealership sold cars, and the bar sold booze. When the canola crop was bad, everyone suffered.And then one day the people of Dauphin were told they had been chosen to be part of an experiment, due to a bold decision by the country’s Liberal government. For a long time, Canadians had been wondering if the welfare state they had been developing, in fits and starts over the years, was too clunky and inefficient and didn’t cover enough people. The point of a welfare state is to establish a safety net below which nobody should ever be allowed to fall: a baseline of security that would prevent people from becoming poor and prevent anxiety. But it turned out there was still a lot of poverty, and a lot of insecurity, in Canada. Something wasn’t working. So somebody had what seemed like an almost stupidly simple idea. Up to now, the welfare state had worked by trying to plug gaps—by catching the people who fell below a certain level and nudging them back up. But if insecurity is about not having enough money to live on, they wondered, what would happen if we just gave everyone enough, with no strings attached? What if we simply mailed every single Canadian citizen—young, old, all of them—a check every year that was enough for them to live on?It would be set at a carefully chosen rate. You’d get enough to survive, but not enough to have luxuries. They called it a universal basic income. Instead of using a net to catch people when they fall, they proposed to raise the floor on which everyone stands. This idea had even been mooted by right-wing politicians like Richard Nixon, but it had never been tried before. So the Canadians decided to do it, in one place. That’s how for several years, the people of Dauphin were given a guarantee: Each of you will be unconditionally given the equivalent of $19,000 U.S. (in today’s money) by the government. You don’t have to worry. There’s nothing you can do that will take away this basic income.At that time, over in Toronto, there was a young economics student named Evelyn Forget, and one day, one of her professors told the class about this experiment. She was fascinated. But then, three years into the experiment, power in Canada was transferred to a Conservative government, and the program was abruptly shut down. The guaranteed income vanished. To everyone except the people who got the checks—and one other person—it was quickly forgotten. Thirty years later, that young economics student, Evelyn, had become a professor at the medical school of the University of Manitoba, and she kept bumping up against some disturbing evidence. It is a well-established fact that the poorer you are, the more likely you are to become depressed or anxious—and the more likely you are to become sick in almost every way. In the United States, if you have an income below $20,000, 2 you are more than twice as likely to become depressed as somebody who makes $70,000 or more. And if you receive a regular income from property you own, you are ten times less likely to develop an anxiety disorder than if you don’t get any income from property.“One of the things I find just astonishing,” she told me, “is the direct relationship between poverty and the number of moodaltering drugs that people take—the antidepressants they take just to get through the day.” If you want to really treat these problems, Evelyn believed, you need to deal with these questions. And so Evelyn found herself wondering about that old experiment that had taken place decades earlier. What were the results? Did the people who were given that guaranteed income get healthier? What else might have changed in their lives? She began to search for academic studies written back then. She found nothing. So she began to write letters and make calls. She knew that the experiment was being studied carefully at the time—that mountains of data were gathered. That was the whole point: it was a study. Where did it go? After a lot of detective work, stretching over five years, she finally got an answer. She was told that the data gathered during the experiment was hidden away in the National Archives, on the verge of being thrown in the trash. “I got there—and found most of it in paper. It was actually sitting in boxes,” she told me. “There were eighteen hundred cubic feet. That’s eighteen hundred bankers’ boxes, full of paper.”Nobody had ever added up the results. When the Conservatives came to power, they didn’t want anyone to look further— they believed the experiment was a waste of time and contrary to their moral values. So Evelyn and a team of researchers began the long task of figuring out what the basic income experiment had actually achieved, all those years before. At the same time, they started to track down the people who had lived through it, to discover the long-term effects. The first thing that struck Evelyn, as she spoke to the people who’d been through the program, was how vividly they remembered it. Everyone had a story about how it had affected their lives. They told her that, primarily, “the money acted as an insurance policy. It just sort of removed the stress of worrying about whether or not you can afford to keep your kids in school for another year, whether or not you could afford to pay for the things that you had to pay for.”This had been a conservative farming community, and one of the biggest changes was how women saw themselves. Evelyn met with one woman who had taken her check and used it to become the first female in her family to get a postsecondary education. She trained to be a librarian and rose to be one of the most respected people in the community. She showed Evelyn pictures of her two daughters graduating, and she talked about how proud she was she had been able to become a role model for them. Other people talked about how it lifted their heads above constant insecurity for the first time in their lives. One woman had a disabled husband and six kids, and she made a living by cutting people’s hair in her front room. She explained that the universal income meant for the first time the family had “some cream in the coffee”—small things that made life a little better.These were moving stories—but the hard facts lay in the number crunching. After years of compiling the data, here are some of the key effects Evelyn discovered. 3 Students stayed at school longer, and performed better there. The number of low-birth-weight babies declined, as more women delayed having children until they were ready. Parents with newborn babies stayed at home longer to care for them, and didn’t hurry back to work. Overall work hours fell modestly, as people spent more time with their kids, or learning.But there was one result that struck me as particularly important. Evelyn went through the medical records of the people taking part—and she found that, as she explained to me, there were “fewer people showing up at their doctor’s \\[office\\] complaining about mood disorders.” Depression and anxiety in the community fell significantly. When it came to severe depression and other mental health disorders that were so bad the patient had to be hospitalized, there was a drop of 9 percent in just three years. Why was that? “It just removed the stress—or reduced the stress—that people dealt with in their everyday lives,” Evelyn concludes. You knew you’d have a secure income next month, and next year, so you could create a picture of yourself in the future that was stable. It had another unanticipated effect, she told me. If you know you have enough money to live on securely, no matter what happens, you can turn down a job that treats you badly, or that you find humiliating. “It makes you less of a hostage to the job you have, and some of the jobs that people work just in order to survive are terrible, demeaning jobs,” she says. It gave you “that little bit of power to say—I don’t need to stay here.” That meant that employers had to make work more appealing. And over time, it was poised to reduce inequality in the town—which we would expect to reduce the depression caused by extreme status differences.For Evelyn, all this tells us something fundamental about the nature of depression. “If it were just a brain disorder,” she told me, “if it was just a physical ailment, you wouldn’t expect to see such a strong correlation with poverty,” and you wouldn’t see such a significant reduction from granting a guaranteed basic income. “Certainly,” she said, “it makes the lives of individuals who receive it more comfortable—which works as an antidepressant.” As Evelyn looks out over the world today, and how it has changed from the Dauphin of the mid-1970s, she thinks the need for a program like this— across all societies—has only grown.Back then, “people still expected to graduate from high school and to go get a job and work at the same company \\[or\\] at least in the same industry until they’d be sixty-five, and then they’d be retired with a nice gold watch and a nice pension.” But “people are struggling to find that kind of stability in labor today … I don’t think those days are ever coming back. We live in a globalized world. The world has changed, fundamentally.” We won’t regain security by going backward, especially as robots and technology render more and more jobs obsolete—but we can go forward, to a basic income for everyone.As Barack Obama suggested in an interview late in his presidency, a universal income may be the best tool we have for recreating security, not with bogus promises to rebuild a lost world, but by doing something distinctively new. Buried in those dusty boxes of data in the Canadian national archives, Evelyn might have found one of the most important antidepressants for the twenty-first century. I wanted to understand the implications of this more, and to explore my own concerns and questions about it, so I went to see a brilliant Dutch economic historian named Rutger Bregman. He is the leading European champion of the idea of a universal basic income. 4 We ate burgers and inhaled caffeinated drinks and ended up talking late into the night, discussing the implications of all this. “Time and again,” he said, “we blame a collective problem on the individual. So you’re depressed? You should get a pill. You don’t have a job? Go to a job coach—we’ll teach you how to write a résumé or \\[to join\\] LinkedIn. But obviously, that doesn’t go to the root of the problem … Not many people are thinking about what’s actually happened to our labor market, and our society, that these \\[forms of despair\\] are popping up everywhere.” Even middle-class people are living with a chronic “lack of certainty” about what their lives will be like in even a few months’ time, he says.The alternative approach—a guaranteed income—is partly about removing this humiliation and replacing it with security. It has now been tried in many places on a small scale, as he documents in his book Utopia for Realists. There’s always a pattern, he shows. When it’s first proposed, people say— what, just give out money? That will destroy the work ethic. People will just spend it on alcohol and drugs and watching TV. And then the results come in. For example, in the Great Smoky Mountains, there’s a Native American tribal group of eight thousand people who decided to open a casino. But they did it a little differently. They decided they were going to split the profits equally among everyone in the group—they’d all get a check for (as it turned out) $6,000 a year, rising to $9,000 later. It was, in effect, a universal basic income for everyone. Outsiders told them they were crazy. But when the program was studied in detail by social scientists, it turned out that this guaranteed income triggered one big change. Parents chose to spend a lot more time with their children, and because they were less stressed, they were more able to be present with their kids. The result? Behavioral problems like ADHD and childhood depression fell by 40 percent. 5 I couldn’t find any other instance of a reduction in psychiatric problems in children by that amount in a comparable period of time. They did it by freeing up the space for parents to connect with their kids. All over the world—from Brazil to India—these experiments keep finding the same result. Rutger told me: “When I ask people—‘What would you \\[personally\\] do with a basic income?’ about 99 percent of people say—‘I have dreams, I have ambitions, I’m going to do something ambitious and useful.’ ” But when he asks them what they think other people would do with a basic income, they say—oh, they’ll become lifeless zombies, they’ll bingewatch Netflix all day.This program does trigger a big change, he says—but not the one most people imagine. The biggest change, Rutger believes, will be in how people think about work. When Rutger asks people what they actually do at work, and whether they think it is worthwhile, he is amazed by how many people readily volunteer that the work they do is pointless and adds nothing to the world. The key to a guaranteed income, 7 Rutger says, is that it empowers people to say no. For the first time, they will be able to leave jobs that are degrading, or humiliating, or excruciating. Obviously, some boring things will still have to be done. That means those employers will have to offer either better wages, or better working conditions. In one swoop, the worst jobs, the ones that cause the most depression and anxiety, will have to radically improve, to attract workers. People will be free to create businesses based on things they believe in, to run Kotti-style projects to improve their community, to look after their kids and their elderly relatives. Those are all real work—but much of the time, the market doesn’t reward this kind of work. When people are free to say no, Rutger says, “I think the definition of work would \\[become\\] to add something of value—to make the world a little more interesting, or a bit more beautiful.”This is, we have to be candid, an expensive proposal—a real guaranteed income would take a big slice of the national wealth of any developed country. At the moment, it’s a distant goal. But every civilizing proposal started off as a utopian dream—from the welfare state, to women’s rights, to gay equality. President Obama said it could happen in the next twenty years. 8 If we start to argue and campaign for it now—as an antidepressant; as a way of dealing with the pervasive stress that is dragging so many of us down—it will, over time, also help us to see one of the factors that are causing all this despair in the first place. It’s a way, Rutger explained to me, of restoring a secure future to people who are losing the ability to see one for themselves; a way of restoring to all of us the breathing space to change our lives, and our culture. I was conscious, as I thought back over these seven provisional hints at solutions to our depression and anxiety, that they require huge changes—in our selves, and in our societies. When I felt that way, a niggling voice would come into my head. It said—nothing will ever change. The forms of social change you’re arguing for are just a fantasy. We’re stuck here. Have you watched the news? You think positive changes are a-coming? When these thoughts came to me, I always thought of one of my closest friends.In 1993, the journalist Andrew Sullivan was diagnosed as HIV-positive. It was the height of the AIDS crisis. Gay men were dying all over the world. There was no treatment in sight. Andrew’s first thought was: I deserve this. I brought it on myself. He had been raised in a Catholic family in a homophobic culture 9 in which, as a child, he thought he was the only gay person in the whole world, because he never saw anyone like him on TV, or on the streets, or in books. He lived in a world where if you were lucky, being gay was a punchline, and if you were unlucky, it got you a punch in the face. So now he thought—I had it coming. This fatal disease is the punishment I deserve. For Andrew, being told he was going to die of AIDS made him think of an image. He had once gone to see a movie and something went wrong with the projector, and the picture went all wrong—it displayed at a weird, unwatchable angle. It stayed like that for a few minutes. His life now, he realized, was like sitting in that cinema, except this picture would never be right again.Not long after, he left his job as editor of one of the leading magazines in the United States, the New Republic. His closest friend, Patrick, was dying of AIDS—the fate Andrew was now sure awaited him. So Andrew went to Provincetown, the gay enclave at the tip of Cape Cod in Massachussetts, to die. That summer, in a small house near the beach, he began to write a book. He knew it would be the last thing he ever did, so he decided to write something advocating a crazy, preposterous idea—one so outlandish that nobody had ever written a book about it before. He was going to propose that gay people should be allowed to get married, just like straight people. He thought this would be the only way to free gay people from the self-hatred and shame that had trapped Andrew himself. It’s too late for me, he thought, but maybe it will help the people who come after me. When the book—Virtually Normal—came out a year later, Patrick died when it had only been in the bookstores for a few days, and Andrew was widely ridiculed for suggesting something so absurd as gay marriage. Andrew was attacked not just by right-wingers, but by many gay leftwingers, who said he was a sellout, a wannabe heterosexual, a freak, for believing in marriage. A group called the Lesbian Avengers turned up to protest at his events with his face in the crosshairs of a gun. Andrew looked out at the crowd and despaired. This mad idea—his last gesture before dying —was clearly going to come to nothing.When I hear people saying that the changes we need to make in order to deal with depression and anxiety can’t happen, I imagine going back in time, to the summer of 1993, to that beach house in Provincetown, and telling Andrew something: Okay, Andrew, you’re not going to believe me, but this is what’s going to happen next. Twenty-five years from now, you’ll be alive. I know; it’s amazing; but wait—that’s not the best part. This book you’ve written—it’s going to spark a movement. And this book—it’s going to be quoted in a key Supreme Court ruling declaring marriage equality for gay people. And I’m going to be with you and your future husband the day after you receive a letter from the president of the United States telling you that this fight for gay marriage that you started has succeeded in part because of you. He’s going to light up the White House like the rainbow flag that day. He’s going to invite you to have dinner there, to thank you for what you’ve done. Oh, and by the way—that president? He’s going to be black.It would have seemed like science fiction. But it happened. It’s not a small thing to overturn two thousand years of gay people being jailed and scorned and beaten and burned. It happened for one reason only. Because enough brave people banded together and demanded it. Every single person reading this is the beneficiary of big civilizing social changes that seemed impossible when somebody first proposed them. Are you a woman? My grandmothers weren’t even allowed to have their own bank accounts until they were in their forties, by law. Are you a worker? The weekend was mocked as a utopian idea when labor unions first began to fight for it. Are you black, or Asian, or disabled? You don’t need me to fill in this list. So I told myself: if you hear a thought in your head telling you that we can’t deal with the social causes of depression and anxiety, you should stop and realize—that’s a symptom of the depression and anxiety itself.Yes, the changes we need now are huge. They’re about the size of the revolution in how gay people were treated. But that revolution happened. There’s a huge fight ahead of us to really deal with these problems. But that’s because it’s a huge crisis. We can deny that—but then we’ll stay trapped in the problem. Andrew taught me: The response to a huge crisis isn’t to go home and weep. It’s to go big. It’s to demand something that seems impossible—and not rest until you’ve achieved it. Every now and then, Rutger—the leading European campaigner for a universal basic income—will read a news story about somebody who has made a radical career choice. A fifty-year-old man realizes he’s unfulfilled as a manager so he quits, and becomes an opera singer. A forty-five-year-old woman quits Goldman Sachs and goes to work for a charity. “It is always framed as something heroic,” Rutger told me, as we drank our tenth Diet Coke between us. People ask them, in awe: “Are you really going to do what you want to do?” Are you really going to change your life, so you are doing something that fulfills you? It’s a sign, Rutger says, of how badly off track we’ve gone, that having fulfilling work is seen as a freakish exception, like winning the lottery, instead of how we should all be living. Giving everyone a guaranteed basic income, he says “is actually all about making \\[it so we tell everyone\\]—‘Of course you’re going to do what you want to do. You’re a human being. You only live once. What would you want to do \\[instead\\]—something you don’t want to do?’ ”\"TLDR: Economic insecurity/poverty is a leading cause of depression and anxiety and a main detractor towards having a fulfilling life. UBI could be an answer, but we need to make it happen.

They may not know they need it yet, but they do. And I'm here to tell you that hope is real. In a life of trials, in the world of challenges, hope is real. In a country where families go without health care, where some go without food, some don't even have a home to speak of, hope is real. In a time of global chaos and instability where our faiths collide, as often as our weapons, hope is real. Hope is what gives us the courage to take on our greatest challenges, to move forward together. We live in cynical times, I know that. But hope is not up for debate. There is such a thing as false science, there is such a thing as false promises, I am sure I will have my share of false starts. But there is no such thing as false hope. There is only hope.-Matt Santos *The West Wing*I always really really liked that speech, because hope can never be false. For the past year I've been so depressed. This is country, my home, the one my father worked so hard to bring my family to from India, taking shit jobs to give us a better future than he had growing up in a poor 13 person family.  I was born in this country, fun fact my birthday is actually the fourth of July. I loved this country so much. And since Trump was elected I was extremely depressed. Things seemed to get worse and worse. Everyday we found out that he betrayed us more and more, he was a rat who sold our country out to the Russians and billionaires. Every day I would see 5 more headlines and get more upset. So defeated that I couldn't do anything about it. My wife and I went of birth control a few months ago. We want a family so bad. But every day I think about how much worse it's getting out here. Every day I see another video of a cop shooting a black kid for no reason. Of a white supremacist getting on stage and I stead of being laughed at *getting cheered on*. I have a good job but not a formal education (yet). I talked to my wife about leaving. Trying to emigrate to a country that had it's shit together so we could give a better life for our children likey father did to me. However with just a highschool diploma I doubt I'd get a visa anywhere. Nonetheless I didn't want to see my country crumble and fail. I wasnt just sitting on the couch griping. I was fading in and out of the real world lost in terrifying thoughts. I was crying and distressed constantly by myself. I did not want this to happen. I just felt so beat down, there are so many problems. What can I do. There's no way I can help, can fox anything, this country was destined to rot and implode. But today went on to some Democrats campaign sites and I saw hope. I saw them vocalizing the very issues I care about. Describing perfect what I believed this country should be. I saw hope. I know this isn't a typical post. I'm not sure if this is allowed. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind or stand on a soapbox or canvass for votes. I just wanted to share with someone, after months of feeling destitute and depression that today I had a glimmer of hope.

My parents are from an extremely conservative and old fashioned environment. Where I'm from the general attitude to things like depression and mental illnesses is that it's fake.&amp;#x200B;My dad is well, he's an alcoholic who smokes heavily, and abuses drugs. (IMP Note: Abuses in the sense that he doesn't take medication which he REALLY needs to take out of pure stubbornness rather than well. Take it.)&amp;#x200B;He has been hospitalized 11 times so far for it all. And his general attitude is one of someone who is such an arrogant, toxic asshole, that me, my mother and sis argue over who has to stay with him should something happen. His own friends, coworkers and brother have cut him out of their lives almost entirely now. We're pretty much all he has left but that doesn't stop him.   Also VERY IMP NOTE: The culture of where I'm living right now (India) is that the elder of the family can do whatever the fuck he wants, and that the younger family members have to deal with it. Combine that with  the fact that he's the father and he has a free pass to be a complete and other toxic waste of humanity.&amp;#x200B;My mother is one of those extremely melodramatic people who enjoys tragedy in her family so she can create drama and lament to her friends. and my sister has the delusions that despite all that, we can be one big happy family (we can't) so yeah no one ever bothers to keep him in check.&amp;#x200B;Mother has the above thing, as well as the fact that she's extremely old fashioned and pretty much a terrible human being so yeah, she is not fun either. More than enough times she will actually try and squash you down and make you feel like shit if she actually she's you being happy. A fact that both me and my sister have noticed and commented on.&amp;#x200B;Sister is a little better, but she was raised by a boarding school, as well as my dad's brother and his wife. So she has almost never had to deal with them until 2-3 years ago when we all moved in together for now. So when it comes to the say of who is right on who is a bad person, her kid brother or her own parents. She sides with the parents.&amp;#x200B;Last year I used to go to a public hospital to get antidepressants as you can imagine all of that has well...&amp;#x200B;I'm depressed, suicidal, anxious most of the time, got a lot of pent-up rage, and am an insomniac, you tell me.&amp;#x200B;So for a few days I used to go there, and get meds and everything was fine, until my mom one day found them. Her immediate reaction was akin to the \"Depression is fake.\" mentality she has and just said that I was 'Scared for exams because I never study' she told my sister later on about this. She was initially supportive and took me to a psychiatrist and got me medication.  This went for about 2 weeks, then they stopped everything, and took me off all the meds cold-turkey. and declared that I was lying about it all, and that I was doing a fake drama about mental illness because I was lazy and don't want to work hard.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;So yeah.... that's the reason why the only thoughts that genuinely give me relief right now are of them suffering.   I might be a horrible person for that, but I stopped caring about that at this point because at least now I know for sure the kind of people \\*they\\* are.", "is_suicide": 0}, {"created": 1558777099.0, "author": "RoUrBoat123", "title": "Someone help", "selftext": "I just need someone to talk to.

This is my first post here and probably last. I love this community I come here daily just to read and go through all the different experiences people share. Now back to my story, I will keep it short. I am 28 years old from Delhi, India. I didn't have bad childhood or any problems I can think of. After completing my school I joined merchant Navy in hope of completing my dream of having a lot of money so that I can have and give a good life to my parents. Ever since I was in merchant Navy I felt this incline towards negativity and that's the time I started smoking too, I don't do drugs although I have tried but they ended up making me more miserable in my head. The negativity continued for a while and I had bad experience with bully superiors on my 2nd ship they used to make me work 20 hours a day non stop manual labour with no chance to go anywhere ( since I am on ship only option was to jump in ocean). While this was going on I even tried to break my own wrist with an iron wrench so that I can get off the ship due to medical emergency but that didn't work out. After 3 months that  horrible period ended and I went home to study and do courses to give exam for becoming an officer. I passed all exams just one interview left and I still don't know the reason to this day I never was able to give that exam. I used to book it but then lost confidence in myself. After 3 years of attempts and living on mere cents of money I decided to try my luck in having a job near home till I can finally get back in navy. Worked for more than 3 years. 3 different jobs .did good at jobs but those jobs were just sucking the life out of me. Constant calling. 15 hours a day labour. 2 hours driving. Negativity rising inside. All my life I always wanted to have someone to love who loves me back too but I failed again and again. Falling for girls who already loves someone else. To cope with this I started mobile gaming , a game called Clash of Kings. I played this game just as fun in beginning but as you know these games require money to play as you level up and want to stay in competition. In my desperate attempt to get over my negativity my lost confidence my issues I played this game and I actually enjoyed and got too much involved in it .I met so many people from different countries made many freinds and also met the most wonderful woman of my life. I will call her Bonnie here . Bonnie met me in the game in September 2017. She is 7 years older than me with a kid. The most amazing person I have ever seen. Always helping people In game in real life. Smart, beautiful,and angel in small words. We connected almost immediately. She wanted me to get better in life. She supported me . I quit my job and decided to go for a career of my liking and she supported me emotionally and financially. I decided to go and learn tourism industry which is my passion and skill. We tried together for more than an year. We have never met but loved each other. Then the problems started I was too much passionate for game and this was coming between my sleep. On her advice I went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life and found out that I have been in severe depression since last 8 years of my life. Oh btw I forgot to mention above that I tried to end my life 2 times before both by taking heavy dosage of paracetamol or Tylenol as in USA. Didn't work. So to make this long story short . I failed at everything in my life repeatedly. Relationships freindships work .. everything I failed..and now due to continuous sadness I lost my woman too.. there are a lot of things in between which I just can't write as it will be too much to write. Taking pills for depression or trying therapy I have tried all. I just don't see any purpose in life. I am actually not even sad anymore. I don't even cry or feel like crying. I just feel no purpose . nothing. I feel totally empty. So I have decided to buy Pottasium cyanide. Also I forgot to tell that I have a lot of money problems such that I cannot even afford to go to doctors anymore since insurance doesn't cover it and I have no income and no will to start working again. I am poor basically. So what I decided is take Pottasium cyanide and use my credit card to go somewhere nice in the hills or maybe Goa and then just 2 3 days of living my life partying and then drink the cyanide. I feel inside this will be complete life for me. A feeling of closure. I don't know why I am writing this here or what I wrote above. Just wanted somewhere someone to know or remember me or maybe remember me for a very short period of time. Love you all.

Now, I'm doing Master's in Health Management cause it sort of gives me a chance to get permanent residency here. I know it seems very shitty but let me explain everything from start, so please read the following and save me. I have few things to make you understand me better. I don't like people, can't stand them. I don't like going to city. I hate crowd. I can't make eye contact. I don't have any feelings left except for sadness and sorrow.

I don't think I would take so much space if I don't go back but I know every other Indian also think about it too. They want to stay here forever but believe me I'm not like them and yes I know I'm not special. I don't want to live in society and be a part of it, I just need nature and peace. I just want to follow my passion of writing and leave everything. I don't want to put anybody in bad light especially Indians for a residency thing. I'm a fucked up person and I couldn't care about anything else even if I wanted to. Sometimes, I think about disappearing and not coming out for several years. If I do this, my parents would have nobody as I'm their only child and that's the thing, that I don't have any feelings left for them and I know this is extremely fucked up thing. That's why I think about committing suicide but I don't even have courage to do it cause there are so many things I need to do before I die but this damn depression is fucking me everywhere. I don't want or need anything. Please free me from all these fucking liabilities, from all these obligations, just let me live. I don't want to talk to psychiatrists, I know what they'll say. I can't live like this, don't know what love is or if it's real or can it save someone. I think of it as an illusion and only this melancholy is real. Now, I know how the people go crazy and lose their sanity. I can't fathom all of my thoughts into this post and you can't understand what I'm trying to say as this medium of interaction is still somewhat limited. But, please, still try to understand what I'm saying. I won't be able to live this way for long. The conclusion is: I can't study this course, it's so uninteresting and the amount to do it, is so high. If I pay back $22000 to my parents, they would still think of me as a disappointment as I couldn't complete my study after I always wanted to go abroad to study. I'm in total depression, you don't how it feels to just die every second. I can't explain what this is. I just need someone to sit with me and understand me and give me the answer whether right or wrong and kill me. This Earth is a fucking cold dead place that only gives you reasons to die. There are still so many things that need to be said but if I  write them, it'd make no sense. I don't want to go back and I don't want to be a part of society here.

I havent interacted with my school friends since feb of this year and it was only to talk about exams and nothing else. I havent hanged with anyone since oct of last year. Im not eating at all. Seeing and smelling any food even if it was my fav makes me cringe. I can go entire days on one meal or less. Ive started to doubt myself a lot and I'm getting regular panic attacks where i get suicidal , my body starts to shake , i get headache and i cant do anything but cry and get hopeless. Ive never tried to self harm but i do get thoughts every now and then. nightmares are something im so used to at this point that theyre not even scary. I was getting sleep paralyzed as well to the point where i got used to it. I even have problem falling asleep and even when i do sleep i cant sleep for more than 5 hours. last year i was super clingy , i used to make sexual jokes to make others laugh and i used to seek attention from everyone. i was never bad at concentrating and studying. but this year i cant help but feel down. its now normal thing. isolating myself from everyone , leaving everyone on read , not picking up phone calls and making up excuses. i just changed and became complete opposite to what i was last year. last year i tried to fit in and this year i dont care about anyone anymore. i even get super bad mood swings. like im all laughing one moment and next moment im either suicidal or want to murder whoever tries to talk to me&amp;#x200B;so now ill start with a bit of my backstory and then a bit about my parents cuz for me theyre the reason. so im from india and mental health issues are something asians take seriously. i was a super loud and energetic kid. i was quite good at drawing and creating stories and i was always proud of my creations be it a story or a manga. i used to represent school in art competitions as well and my art teacher had a lot of confidence in me that ill be super successful if i pursue something in field of anime. since 4th grade i watched a lot of anime getting inspired by them and started to write my own mangas as well. i was above average in studies as well so my teachers used to let me skip their classes to draw if my grade werent suffering which they never did i was always around 85%.&amp;#x200B;for my dad my grandpa died when my dad was around 17 years old and had to take care of grandma who was abusive and his siblings who worked with him. thats all i know from his past but my dad is extremely narcissistic where he believes hes always right. he refuses to believe facts and gets angry whenever i put facts in front of him. i even told him that i had panic attacks and i was anxious for exams and that i had confidence issues and i wanted to get therapy but he told me \"just dont be scared\" and continued to yell at me for being scared and started to compare his past to mine. he always points out and mocks whatever i do. im not even exaggerating. he told me that coffee doesnt have caffeine and that its a lie and doesnt believe doctors as well cuz he \"knows\" from experience. he even mocks the way i study like if im lying down and reading a book he will mock me. if im reading articles on laptop he would mock me to read a book.&amp;#x200B;for my mom she had a super fancy and comfortable childhood. my grandparents are super lovely and they live in expensive place. so my mom is basically someone who wants best for her and doesnt care about anyone in family. she also doesnt care about facts.  she would always fight with dad for not getting enough salary when we are in no debt. she always compares dad to his brother and its always saddening hearing them fight everyday. it doesnt get violent though. its still humane enough but still it started to bother me. she always act like a small child who needs people around her and if she needs something done then it has to be done instantly or else she would turn it into drama and make herself look like victim. she makes fuzz out of every small thing. last year i had a lovely girlfriend who told me to write my feelings in diary and my mom found out about it and started to mock me for thinking about self harm.&amp;#x200B;so basically i never had any say in any of my life decisions and i know they want best for me but i still feel like i cant do what they want anymore. ive graduated from highschool and wanted to pursue manga art and wanted to move to japan but my parents lied that they would let me. now for 1 straight year theyre constantly making me change my future. first marine then fine arts then graphic designing then engineering. ive wasted an entire year cuz they are forcing me into doing something i dont wanna do and now theyre blaming me and saying \"i wasted my entire year cuz i wanted to do all this and that my friends are toxic and theyre making me fail at life\" first i havent talked to my friends in months second my friends know nothing about what i wanna do third i never said yes to anything except marine engineering and they forced me into all other things. it just hurts seeing how blinded theyre that they cant see what i want and are again forcing me into computer engineering. blaming me and my friends for everything they had done for entire year is just breaking me and i cant even trust anyone anymore. i dont even feel like talking. but still it feels like other people are going through worse and im just being weak. my current girlfriend is trying her hardest as well but i feel like im bothering her too

For my bachelors, I graduated in the top 1% with accolades. Hated Masters but got through with 3.25 GPA. Worked for 6.5 years in the USA until my final employer essentially fired me for underperforming due to the major depression. That fine day in May 2004, I was in senior year of high school. I had Physics and Chemistry tests the very next day. I had just been to the hospital and was given massive doses of antibiotics for bronchitis for over 15 days. Was diagnosed as hypothyroid. Was in a prep school kind of scenario - so EXTRA pressure and stress. That day, my brain stopped being interested in anything anymore. Got into serious depression and anxiety. Obesity, insulin resistance, PCOS and CFS followed. Still suffering despite in numerous medicines, psychiatrists, therapists, ECT treatments, diet and lifestyle changes, supplement additions and everything in between. Tried a bunch of nootropics. Finally came across some back often recently- somehow helps in combination with my Effexor.I’m not sad anymore- get suicidal when I quit medicines for a day though. But the anhedonia and depersonalization/ de realization are VERY STRONGLY present.I was an excellent student- straight As from kindergarten: excelled at extra-curricular stuff, class monitor, prizes and accolades. Obese, so terribly low self-esteem. No friends. Thought if I just worked hard, made a good life, my success would help me get over the fact that I had no social life and no pleasures in life- not even access to a TV or computer. Okay, I decided after crying everyday for the past 15 years that I can’t get out of bed, I need to do something I can remotely stand, to be able to get close enough to a normal and productive life as possible. See that inability to study and perform in my senior year, got my scores down low enough that I couldn’t pursue medicine or bioengineering as I had always wanted. My whole life, I worked for that. I didn’t want to live anymore. But I did and still do- I’m too scared I will not be successful with suicide. I’ve enrolled in a Data Analytics degree- essentially some computer stuff and math. I need to do some pre requisites and also start on the course. But I CAN’T STUDY. I am not interested. I’ve been procrastinating for close to 13 months, deferred my admission to this Fall. I have no more time though. Failing in this will only set me back- cause all those emotions about not being good enough to come rushing back. I can’t handle anymore failure. Already have a soul-crushing “anything-I-do-will-turn out to be crap” vibe going for me- it scares my family why I’ve had such bad luck going for me for so long. As a result of losing my job, I was forced out of the country and had to come back home to India. I gave up my apartment, sold my car, my belongings and moved in with my parents, had another stint at the mental hospital, have very little money to my name.But all this can change. I have plans to complete this degree and get a stable job, where I’ll have more security and creative freedom. Build my life again. And then follow my passion and pursue a Bachelors, Masters and doctoral degrees in biology/ bioengineering from Europe ( no age limits, is cheaper and better). I can build all that back- do everything I’ve wanted to do and more.BUT I CAN’T STUDY. It used to be my identity. I was always identified as the good student. Getting good grades was all I had going for me.  All those years of hard work did go down the drain, yes.  But I still have time. If only I can bring myself to care....Can anyone relate to this? I’ve lived like this for 15 years. I only did well in my Bachelors because I paid attention in class and took notes- never used the textbooks. To this day, I cannot read a book. I understand the loss of passion with depression. But why am I rebelling against myself when it comes to doing something productive with my life- I’m never interested in anything to do with my professional life. But the other part of me that drove me to be a good student all my life is still intact- the two personalities are tearing me apart. I’m constantly guilty about not meeting my high expectations, but I can’t even do the bare minimum and at least give it a try. the indifference is astounding. Therapists have talked to me for hours- I’ve never changed. How do I tell my brain that I won’t be hard on it anymore- that I care for my body. That this studying or caring to do anything in life other than eat and watch videos from bed is actually good for me and may actually work?PLEASE SOMEONE, HELP ME STUDY!!! PLEASE, PLEASE.

Moving at the end of the month to be back with my mom, who can barely help herself. Hopefully any money I make can go to help her and myself. My brother probably won't graduate, just like I almost did. I helped raise him, so I feel responsible. Car still acting up 4 wheel drive just having trouble now too. I keep feeling like, \"Hey, at least this is rock bottom, can only go up, right?\" Then it keeps going lower. I try to remind myself that \"Hey, at least you aren't in that whole mess with India and Pakistan right now, or deployed, or fighting ISIS, or a refugee, or still being abused like you were as a child, or in Venezuela, or being sold as a slave.\" Then I go to the good things in my life.  \"Your family loves you, so much buddy. All of them. You are a pillar of the family, they are so worried for you, and wish they could do more. Please keep going for them. Your buddy Billy loves you as a brother man, he stayed with you that bad night. Bought you pizza, remember? Watched a couple movies. Your platoon and squad sgts care, got you in touch with that free shrink. Shrink cares, she just about cried when you told her all the shit you went through as a kid. See, life isn't so bad if all those people care.\"Now, this used to keep me going. Their love, affection. Made my heart swell with undying love. I would die for every one of them. But as time keeps going, rock bottom keeps sinking, time getting shorter, life harder. That love just turns to shame. It turns to grief, and despair. My depression getting heavier, and heavier. The more lost I am in the Valley of Darkness, who's evil I fear, for what if the Shepherd doesn't exist, and the blind man isn't even being led, but stumbling in his hour of need, no one to take his hand. God, it's so dark. My soul yearns for peace, but I am so plagued by the demons of the past, and my present.
