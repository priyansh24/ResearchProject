I can understand that worrying about academics should not be considered depression exactly, but the fact that I'm worthless piece of shit brought me here. I usually am a wannabe funny guy who has really cool internet friends, but sometimes I think they talk to me just bcoz they feel bad for me. Its not like I'm an introvert or something but socializing doesn't feel like how it used to feel. I live in a small apartment with my parents, who are very strict and they expect too much from me, but I don't think i can live upto that. I see people my age doing so well in everything or atleast something, and I'm here just wondering when will I die. Sometimes i think my parents don't deserve me but then again its me who's always causing problems. I have literally no interest in anything and since I'm their only child, they keep on expecting too much from me. During this pandemic, if i could've studied a little, i think I might've been better than what I am now. Cuz right now ,here in India its the only thing that matters. Sometimes I hate the way my parents treat me, i just want to move out but then again, its India. I used to like gaming as a way to escape reality until my dad sold my PC. Everyday I wake up hoping that i would change but then i just keep on disappointing myself and everyone around me. I hate myself for everything I do.Sometimes I can't bare to stay with my parents so I go out in this 'gaming cafe', where i spend my saved up money to play this stupid games. I know its wrong to blame my parents, I can understand but they're too much sometimes. My mom is kindof dying, she has Parkinson's and my dad isn't that good of a person. He has a low salary job but he's not home most of the times. I feel terrible seeing my like this and I can't do anything about it, she hates me because I'm not much great of a son. I have some friends irl too but I don't like to bother them. Everyone has their own stuff to handle. I see people in relationships, hanging out together, having fun with their siblings, making their parents proud, which makes me hate everyone around me including myself. I barely even passed 11th grade and I think I'm nothing and even if I try to convince myself that I'm something I can't. I'm tired of waiting.

People say mentally ill people don't have clear judgement and are unable to find solutions. So please help me. It started with never-ending headaches and i couldn't study(i used to be topper in class, as others say). Studying gives me severe headache which I can't bear and cry uncontrollably. I've been dropping for 2 years and not attending my 10th board exams, as people say this exam is crucial for getting job in india. I've been in medication for depression and anxiety for a year now. I've said to my psychiatrist that my headaches are severe and I can't study because of them so many times that he seems annoyed whenever i mention my headache. He says its because I don't study. But i can't study because of these headaches. I am stuck at this pit of no hope. Therapy isn't available here and i only get councelling which doesn't help me at all. My father used to take me to him every month. But now he has to drive my mom to her job. My mom has no holiday for 100 days. So i can't go to the doctor to fix my headache problem. My next school session is starting from march and i am not fixed yet. But i can't waste another year. I think I can never be fixed  and i have to live like this(with depression and anxiety) for the rest of my life. Internet says that if a child's been on depression and hasn't gotten out of it in year, chances are this is chronic depression. Medication have helped with anxiety but not with depression. Which means i can't do anything and will be a failure ending up as homeless beggar. There seems no solution. Nothing is working even after getting professional help.

The only thing I want is to die. There's absolutely no point to my existence. I'm such a worthless piece of shit that I can't even justify my own existence. I'm still around only because of my family. I've lived with them for the past 8 months (was originally intending to move out in May) due to COVID. I'm moving out in February to college, but I plan to end my life before then. Likely in the next 10 days.I've been suicidal since I was 8 (back then I knew it only as \"kill myself\"). There's so many reasons why, but all of those are irrelevant now. My guilt is the only thing holding me back. I'm lucky to have grown up with parents and a sister whom I care about very much. I have no idea what effect my death will have on her. She's young (mid teens), but very bright and hardworking. I'm so proud of her and I know that she'll reach happiness. As her older brother, I've done everything I can to encourage her and help her for the past 10 years, and she's finally reached the point where she's independent and strong.I can't imagine how she would feel after hearing I'm dead. When I think about how my family would react to my death, I immediately have this pain that radiates outward from my heart to the nerves in my arms and it's so bad that I usually have to sit down. This has prevented me from planning anything further than the basics for a while. I have finally overcome this pain, for whatever reason, and I have a plan that will allow me to escape my own head and give my parents plausible deniability of my death to my sister (so she is not as impacted).I don't understand myself. Why am I suicidal? I think that it ultimately stems down to feelings of inadequacy and my inability to be happy. In high school, I was great at science. For sake of anonymity, I won't elaborate further, but I did well and I'm now enrolled in a great university. I always told myself that I would be happy after I did this, or I got into that, but it was never enough. There was always more and more and no matter what I did, I felt like a disappointment and a loser. This is of no fault to my parents -- they were never the traditional \"tiger parents\" that punished me for failure. I can never be the best. Even when I am, it's just a fluke. To anyone reading this, my ramblings are likely incoherent and irrational. But to me, all these statements make perfect sense. I know deep down that I cannot succeed, no matter how much I try, so there's no point in trying. I've tried to help myself, but I don't want to seek professional help. For years I've had bouts of suicidal thoughts lasting weeks and suddenly find something to distract myself with (usually academic) and return back to normal for a little. This no longer seems to be possible. I think about suicide actively instead of the passive thoughts I had several years ago. There is no escape. I feel constantly that I am inadequate, worthless, someone unworthy of success and unworthy of my dreams. I don't know when I changed from a curious, fun loving kid to a suicidal adult, but it happened somewhere within the last 7 years (I'm 19). I've made my choice and I've somehow rationalized it. Onto my plans. I live in a state where it's very easy to purchase a firearm. Over the past 2 years, I've saved up around 15k from competitions and jobs. I'm going to spend 1k to buy a cheap used car, pay cash for a firearm, drive out to a park in my state and commit suicide while leaving a paper trail with flight ticket reservations to India. I gave my parents access to my checking account so the rest of the money should go to pay for my sisters college fund. My parents will likely be informed that I am missing, with signs pointing to a suicide (any purchase of a firearm is registered with the government, so they would certainly suspect a suicide). I also have a note with details so they have some closure that will be released a week after I am gone. I think I am giving my parents the option to tell my sister that I have gone backpacking or some other hippie activity in Asia. This should make sense to her, as I have expressed interested in hiking and traveling for the past month. You might think it's sociopathic of me to lie to my sister like this. I have no way to respond. It probably is, but I'm trapped here. I need to die, but I also can't die with this guilt. I won't be dead tomorrow, but if my plans work out, I should be in 12 days. Apart from my family, the world won't miss me much. I doubt my friends will care more than a week out and I expect that my parents won't release the actual news (will just say I've gone backpacking or something). I actually had a pretty good time in school. I was a total nerd, but I was lucky to never be bullied since I'm tall and was the class clown. But I'm an adult now and those moments of distraction are over now. I wrote this post partly to get all this off my chest, but also to seek advice. I don't understand why I rationalized suicide. My situation isn't dire and I'm not struggling to survive, yet I somehow feel that there is no option for my future other than suicide. When I think about myself, I see nothing but worthlessness and failure. Why? If I can understand why, then I can include it on my note so my parents have some concrete reason other than \"I hate myself and I want to die\".", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1611100511.0, "author": "II_Noname_II", "title": "I don't know what to do", "selftext": "19 years old, India, from a lower middle class family. Mom doesn't work. Dad lost his job due to covid. I have elder brother too and he's marginally better than better than me atleast.

As of today I'm in college and seeing my dad in pain because of finance truly hurts me. So I decided to earn money to help my dad (without telling him) I came across many options but I decided to trade stocks and options because of attractive money making opportunity. The money I used was for my college fee my dad gave me plus I borrowed some from my brother. Now that money is completely gone. It started with small amount and gradually I lost it all. It was around $1400. That money is a lot of money for us. My dad said  me 2 years back that he couldn't live a good life but wanted me to live better so he spent huge part of his income for my studies. I am a complete disgrace. My dad has not seen my bank account's balance yet and last date to give college fee is 31st January. Its been about two weeks since I lost the money. I can't face my dad. I don't want to die either. I need help and the only way I see someone helping me is giving back the lost money, but why would anyone give money to a complete stranger like me. I begged for help in other subs only to find that  they require some minimum karma, which is understandable because of potential scams.

I'm not exactly sure why I did that... maybe I  was just holding off on writing this post. I fear that writing this down will just serve to \"ground\" my suicidal thoughts, like \"THERE, I WROTE IT DOWN! OTHER PEOPLE CAN READ IT!\" and that just makes it all too real.Nobody in my life knows that I'm suicidal. I'm 18M, from India. I've had a shit upbringing. My parents had a messy, prolonged divorce when I was in the 6th Grade. My father was abusive towards my mother, often hitting her in front of me and acting very violently towards myself and my mom when he got angry. I was molested by a close relative since I was 6-7 years old, up until when I was 13 or 14. I don't remember much of anything from my childhood except what he did to me, and my parents shouting and screaming at each other. I often ask myself If I liked being molested - I think I even participated in it voluntarily. It disgusts me. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was about 7 or 8 years old.Dad got my custody after the divorce. My mom had nowhere to go, her own parents refused to take her in. She ended up sleeping on the railway platforms for a few days before a friend took her in. her pride wouldn't let her take anything from my dad. Here's the thing about my mom - she's very self-centered. She is in a much better position now, with a somewhat stable income, a pet dog. She can pay the rent on time, and put food on her table. I feel guilty that I couldn't help her out. I know it's irrational guilt, but I still feel this way. But here's the thing about my mom - she is very self-centered. She has faced a lot in life, but she just won't fucking shut up about it. I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS TOO, AND NO ONE EVER BOTHERED. She has been spitting vitriol about my dad, my family, her family, and anyone really, for years and years. When I meet her and talk to her over the phone, It is always this. Not once has she asked me how my studies are going on, how the school is going for me, or just FUCKING ASK IF IM OK. NOT ONCE. She is suicidal and had attempted to kill herself several times. Last year, she almost succeeded. Once, she self-harmed while I was on the telephone with her. I want to help her, but I'm just tired, and can not find the strength. I know she loves me.I don't have a lot to say about my dad - he is very reserved. He and I rarely have conversations. He married a year and a half after the divorce. I rarely interact with my stepmom, but she isn't abusive or anything. My dad expects a lot of academic success from me - I am the first to take science. But he either does not get or does not care, for my emotional well being - all he has ever done is lionize me for \"going through these hardships\". That's it. We are a low-income family, and I know I have to make it.I love science. I like maths and physics most. I wanted to be a physicist. I haven't ever had good teaching or someone who would guide me about how to follow my passions and be successful at it. Here, in India, we have entrance exams that students sit for right after their 12th grade. Many students get coaching, many get private tutors. I have had none - my dad was never interested in finding out how to get me a good education, and I was misguided by what sources I had at my disposal. The exam is in 16 days... I think I'm going to fail. I feel inadequate and I sure as heck don't feel well prepared. I have been crying every day. I took to meditating when I feel overwhelmed, and that helps a bit. Yesterday, I pushed a nail into my arm until it drew blood. The pain felt good, like some sort of cathartic release. Academic success means a lot to me, and I do not know where I will be without it. I worked hard in school to become a model student and win as many competitions and exhibitions as I could. I even became head boy. It helped to distract me... I felt good achieving something meaningful. But now, even that has come crashing down. I can't stop thinking about just ending it - I can't find any meaning. I have no friends. All my middle school friends took to some activities I objected to (we never really had anything in common) and they gradually fazed me out. My GF is a year older and in college, and she continually tries to get my emotional support for her own problems. I don't have ANY SUPPORT TO GIVE. I don't blame her, she does not know about my suicidal tendencies.This is the lowest that I've felt in life, and I've been through some tough times. That is why I finally poured my heart out here. I just want to stop feeling terrible. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fact that mom would most certainly kill herself if she knew - and it's almost funny how I can't even fucking kill myself because of what other people expect of me.

The next morning, we were able to contact him and he told me that he wants to fix his life and more importantly, my brother's life.About my brother, he has always been a smart student. He is extremely smart but poor in decision making. He topped his university in engineering and worked as a civil engineer. In India, it's an extremely competitive exam and only a few hundred can succeed out of hundreds of thousands of students. My brother quit his job to study for this exam as it's his dream as well. He's been trying to pass this exam for a few years but missed by few points. Then he decided to pursue MBA in an ivy league university and my father was very supportive. Because of what happened, it is not possible for my brother to go abroad anymore. We just don't have the money anymore. At the same time, our father lost a huge amount of money in the stock market during the covid crisis. Our family did not know he had bet so much money in it. My brother thought he could rely on family to do something else if he couldn't succeed in his exams. He is now blaming our family for ruining his life, his confidence. He resents them now. The truth is our family gave us everything growing up, never hit us or abused us. And now, my brother feels angry at our father for putting our family through so much trouble and he feels that he ruined his life. My brother is 28 now, can't go anywhere and has no interest in studying for his exams. He says he doesn't care about his life anymore. Just like my father, he once told me he's depressed and that if would be better if he died. He lashes out at family and resents our father. He wants to fix our father's mess and after that, he probably wants to commit suicide.I feel trapped in another country, I can't go back to my country because of covid. I'm trying to support my family, my brother. I suggested them to visit a therapist but they don't take any action. I send money every now and then, I send gifts to make my family happy but I'm alone here. I work 6 days a week to save money for them.There is a possibility that to win the court case but it'll take years. Recently, he told me that once this is all over, he's going to give all the money, properties, inheritance to my brother and told me that he wouldn't be able to give anything to me. I am fine that, I never wanted any of that but this made me clear how much he loves my brother compared to me. I'm not as smart or outgoing as my brother but I still work hard, I'm on my own feet and have a masters degree in IT. My father once told me that he thought I'd be a failure because of my shyness and being socially anxious. Everytime I get a message or phone call from my family, I get extremely anxious and prepare for the worst. It's been very traumatic.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1608490719.0, "author": "thebadcaptain7", "title": "I wish I was born somewhere else.", "selftext": "U might think this guy is so stupid, but listen.

After 12 there are exams Jee( Joint entrance exam) for engineering and NEET for doctors. 1200000 students sit and only 10000 qualify. The pressure is to much, because of the population we have to compete and every parent thinks that it is easy. I think about suicide almost everyday, but I won't do it.

I can feel my pure inferiority as I type it. I amount to nothing and what's the point of carrying on if I have to keep living like this. If reincarnation is real as I have been taught my entire life, then please let me born as black or white, just anything other than Indian. Even Pakistani would be fine with me. Bangladeshi, Nepali, Sri Lakan whateverI was born and raised in the west from an Indian family. They showed me little to no love growing up, abused me mentally, emotionally and physically, brainwashed me, denied me anything I wanted and kicked me out of the house at a young age. I couldn't even count the amount of times my father has told me to jump off a terrace in my life. My brother on the other hand was pampered and loved beyond anything else.The racial bullying got so bad at one point and they did nothing about it. i can remember it like it was yesterday. Every time I would go anywhere it was always \"ew whats that smell\", \"it stinks here\" despite me having showered and wore cologne that day, for those who don't know they were targeted jokes making fun of how Indians smell. \"Go back to your shithole, we shower in this country\". Among other thingsKids would come up to me outta nowhere slap me in the face and say \"hit back Gandhi\", and they were always in groups. too. They would tell me \"I'm not Indian, I'm not stupid\". \"he's stupid, he's indian.\" Couldn't go to the bathroom, as I would always get jumped and ganged up on, the kids would make jokes about how Indians shit ont he floor and how I'm \"not allowed in the bathrooms\". Now none of them would do it 1 on 1, I actually sent a kid to a hospital once, shattered his orbital cause I couldn't take after he had shoved me down in the bathroom and called me \"curry boy\" it but all his friends jumped in and I also ended up in the hospital as well. I always fought back when I was jumped, but to no avail. Admins didn't take it seriously so I'm on my own.And the worst part? This shit is not only condoned but encouraged. Racism against us Indians/Asians in general always flies. Even mongoloid asians r defended more than us. Imagine if it were a black, or hispanic person getting bullied like this, all races would have a issue and it'd make headlines. Even other South Asians would bully me. For some reason pakistanis don't get half the negative stereotypes we do by others, so they would always tell me about how backwards I am because I \"worship cows\" and everyone else would also make fun of me for that. A group of boys threw lemonade in my face and said \"drink this cow piss, hindu\". And the thing is, they defend it by bringing up these stereotypes are based in truth.Drinking cow piss is a part of hinduism, and almost half of India does shit in the streets, they'd say. Always in class they would say \"do u shit on the floor?\" \"does ur mom shit on the floor?\" and I'd be called currymuncher and dothead all the time too. Another thing was when they'd make all the 7/11 slurpee jokes and Indian scammer things.Ik what sum of u may be thinking. \"it's those alt right trumpie white people\" right? No. Surprisingly almost every single incident I had was racism from black people. I don't hate black people at all, and I have some black friends, but 99% of the racism I have faced here is from black people, and they get away with it perfectly fine cause it's just this country's logic that only racism towards them won't be tolerated.Also not to mention being Indian is a turn off for most girls as well. Even pakistanis have better luck here than we do. I been rejected time after time cause I'm Indian, for no other reason, ladies even tell me to my face that's why.God I can't tell you how much school I've missed trying to avoid it too. I'd get beat up and called racial slurs almost every day. The streetshitter jokes got so annoying ad it took a toll on my mental health. I may have been wasting my life staying home and playing video games instead, but it was better than going to schoolThe last straw was when I was in a public bathroom not too long ago. I saw one of my old classmates from before the virus struck, he immediately recognized me and said \"I thought i smelled curry\" and then he caught me by surprise, took my neck and locked me in a rear naked choke while yelling all kinds of slurs.I felt so fucking pathetic, how'd I let that happen to me? I cried myself to sleep for nights after that and just decided I'm gonna end my life. I'm going to wait till after christmas, but I know where my dad keeps his pistol. I'm going to take it, put it in my mouth and point upwards before pulling the trigger and ending it all. I hope if reincarnation is real that I will never EVER be born in this ethnicity again ever.UPDATE: You guys are so awesome, you made my day a whole lot better.

I need this outlet.I'm Indian and in my mid twenties, come from a fairly OK to do family, live and work in one of the major metros. Lived my entire life in Indian concrete jungles only (mom and dad moved around a lot). Financially, i do OK for myself. The money's not great but it pays the bills and i manage to save a decent chunk if it. I'm only doing this job for now cause it pays the bills. I don't think I'm depressed but just aimless and it's now driving me nuts. I know exactly why and it's quite simple: Pretty much all the stuff advertised to me as being associated with the good life doesn't appeal to me in any way: Fancy house, car, vacations, parties...... all that crap. Simply put, most aspects of life don't appeal to me. I'm not materialistic at all and only use my money for the essentials. I have no idea what to do with the rest of it. I've lost interest in everything and everyone. It's boredom rather than depression (do correct me if I'm wrong). I have nothing to aspire to. It's been that way for a couple of years now. I tend to try getting the real purpose of any venture or undertaking and it doesn't seem to get me anywhere. This has started to affect my social life. Almost everyone I come across thinks and talks about stuff that I have absolutely no interest in: career opportunities, cool stuff to buy, who partied where? who's making how much? who's dating who? Stuff that I simply don't give a shit about. I'm off mainstream social media, don't give a fuck about my LinkedIn account and have no clue what to do. Life does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I simply don't give a fuck about doing the stuff that regular people aspire to do: rise in your career, get married, raise a family, acquire a good reputation and retire rich. So I don't really see the point of living. Though I don't have moments of extreme sadness with how my life turned out or I turned out or wishing I could have regular aspirations like everyone else, I do feel like I'm just lying on a bed of roses watching life pass me by.I keep fantasizing about disappearing from everyone and everything, moving somewhere far away maybe to another distant country, start living and working on a farm or in the hills or mountains or something. In a country where no one's ever gonna even think of searching for me there (if it does come down to that). My idea of the perfect life there would be to keep things extremely simple: Rise, work on the farm till the evening and then take a break for the rest of the day: watch the sunset and the scenery, do some drinking, smoke some pot and then contemplate the meaning of life until bedtime. Keep doing this with the hope that I die in my early thirties. The idea is to get away from everything and everyone and be close to nature or to simpler people and not rot in an urban shit hole where almost everyone's caught up in a dick measuring contest.Except that I love and care too much about my family to actually do this. Plus given that I live in India where the ideas of status and reputation in society are so ingrained in you from the start, doing something like this would affect my parents reputation. Not that I give a fuck about mine.Anyone else feel the exact same way? I feel like there aren't a lot many people who feel this way.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1603817472.0, "author": "perk1720", "title": "My friend is in danger because of her Schizophrenic father. Please help", "selftext": "A friend of mine is in serious danger and we need your help. Please read till the end. And suggest some plans.Trigger Warning - Domestic ViolenceMy friend (Female - 20) is being abused by her father who has Schizophrenia. It started way back when she was 13. Due to some petty reason, he started beating her in a fit of rage and it was so bad that she sustained multiple injuries and could have died. She is not the only one suffering from this. It's her mother too.Her father was diagnosed with Schizophrenia a couple of years back and then her family found out the reason behind all the violence. They started giving him medicine from time to time, and the situation improved a little. But it is still bad. There are frequent occasions of domestic violence and it is bad.It is affecting her mental health a lot. She tried convincing her mother to file an FIR against the father but unfortunately her mother is reluctant. For easy conversation, let's call my friend Karol and her mother Jess. Karol needs to leave the place because she's very certain that she'll get murdered by her own father. The violence is increasing again and she's getting more and more paranoid. It's affecting her health, her sleep and her academics. She wants to leave but she doesn't want to leave her mother alone in that scary place... Alone with her father. Anything might happen.And if both Karol and Jess leave together, her father may wreak havoc on their neighbours. Maybe that is one of the reasons Jess won't leave. Because they have relatives living nearby and stuff.They talked about this matter with relatives too. And they went to confront about this matter with her father. And he's so good at acting. He pretends like he understood everything and it was a misunderstanding. Just after the relatives leave, he pretends to be normal and waits till 11/11:30pm before starting his violence again. It's so messed up.According to us, the best solution is to get some professional help by calling a helpline number or something. But we just want to ensure two things. One, that both Karol and Jess get out of that place and don't have to stay with the man. It's very dangerous. Two, that he doesn't come back to their life. He is so gooood at acting, he always escapes treatment. The thing with Schizophrenics is that they're super good with acting and pretending. They think that nothing is wrong with them and deny any such allegation. We fear that he might pretend to be normal and then come back to his normal violent self.Please help her out. It's getting so serious. She's getting more and more paranoid by the day. We need to get her out with a proper plan in 1-2 days. She feels like she could get murdered very soon. She has even tried to commit suicide once. And it's a recurring thought in her mind.

As you know already know, they have completely isolated me. But it's not only that. They do whatever they feel like and completely neglect my opinions on literally everything.For example, when they bring any fancy food (like, sweets, chocolates, etc.), they happily eat their own share and leave my \"share\" (which is usually much less than theirs) on the table (without telling me anything) and go about their day. When I don't eat my \"share\" (please note that while I used to like food 2 years ago, I don't even like having any kind of food nowadays because of the state I am in; they already know my condition but they don't care), all 3 of them start bashing me by calling me \"selfish\", \"ungrateful\", etc. Excuse me?! I feel this way because of THEM and they blame ME?! After they have finished bashing me, they happily eat my \"share\" without any regret.They even cause chaos in case of COVID-19. They go out for unnecessary reasons (like shopping fancy clothes) very frequently. When they return home, I tell them to do certain things, like washing hands with soap and sanitizing certain objects (like the things they took out with them, the non-food items they have bought, the handles of doors and door knobs they have touched after coming back). But they DON'T LISTEN. They just say that I am insane for telling them to do this because \"no one\" in our country (India, a country where people openly cough and sneeze here and there and even throw their mucus on the road, even during this pandemic) does it. Excuse ME?! I am trying to protect THEM and they are accusing ME of being insane?! I literally have to argue with them for around 30 minutes to make them do all these things. But they still try to avoid doing it. When I firmly tell them to do all these properly, they just scream at the top of their lungs and tell me that I am insane because apparently \"no one\" does these things. They compare me with the other citizens of our country (the citizens who, again, don't even wear masks, openly sneeze and cough here and there, throw their mucus in the road, etc.) and say that they are much better than me and accuse me of harassing them. They literally believe that we (specifically) don't have any chance of being infected by COVID-19. When I asked them why, they could not even give any valid reason. They only accused me of saying unholy things when I tell them that everyone has a chance of being infected by COVID-19, including us. WTF?!They constantly say that I am mentally sick for behaving in such a way and not to pay any attention to me. They even went as far as mixing anti-psychotic drugs (Olanzapine) with my food behind my back (when I refused to take this \"medicine\" by myself because it was severely affecting my physical and mental health in an extremely negative way) the last time they took me to the psychiatrist (who, as I have already said in my previous post, did not even listen to what I had to say and was only interested in prescribing me as many medicines as posible). They have even threatened to throw me out of the house multiple times. They say that I am just a nuisance to them.They constantly compare me with the other citizens in literally each and every aspect of my daily life. They never ask me WHY I wake up late (please note that I cannot fall asleep before 6 a.m. everyday because of my mental state), WHY I have my meals late, WHY I don't like eating, etc. They just compare me with \"everyone else\" and blame ME for literally everything that is apparently \"wrong\" with me, from waking up to going to bed. I have heard them talking amongst themselves about me behind my back countless times. They say that I behave this way because apparently I am \"insane\". They say that the reason I refuse to eat and  and feel this way is because of my \"hormonal changes\" and not to pay any attention to me. WHAT?! You mean to tell me that I feel like shit everyday because of my \"hormonal changes\", because I am \"insane\"? You mean to tell me that I have problems with eating, sleeping, waking up, etc. because of my \"hormonal changes\", because I am \"insane\"? And they don't even accept their fault. When I blame them for making me feel like this, they tell me that they apparently \"love\" me and that it is apparently MY fault for feeling this way. When I start trying to hold my ground and try to tell them that THEY are the reason I feel like shit, they, once again, start shouting at the top of their lungs that I am \"selfish\", \"ungrateful\", \"lazy\", \"insane\", \"a nuisance\", that apparently I am causing chaos in the house, that they'll throw me out of the house, etc. (just after a few seconds of them lying to me that they \"love\" me).These 3 have now started doing something suspicious. For the last couple of days (yesterday and today), I noticed that when I go for a bath in the afternoon, my step-mother enters my room, locks the door, opens her cupboard (her cupboard is in my room), takes something out, closes the cupboard, unlocks the door, and goes straight to the kitchen (where our lunch is prepared). As far as I noticed, my father and sister know about this and don't ask her anything. So, I guess it's safe to say that all 3 of them are involved in this act. I don't exactly know what they do but after having my lunch (yesterday and today), I started to feel SO AWFUL. I have a headache, feel dizzy, can't stand properly on my legs and I can't even think clearly. I think they are, once again, mixing some kind of drugs in my lunch before giving it to me (as they did before). What the HELL should I do? As I have already said, I just want to die (even those 3 know about this but they don't care). I think leaving this existence is the only way I'll ever get peace. But the thing is that there is a high chance of me surviving my suicide attempt and being arrested by the police (there is such a law in India, which I have already mentioned before) and living the rest of my life with some kind of disability.

He did not want to rely on his kids even though I would love to take care of both my parents for as long as required.But his plans failed royally and got into a lot of debt. He did everything he could to fix the situation but he couldn't. Not alone. I decided, against my father's wishes, I could put my education on hold and help him. I could resume it anytime.Together we did our best. After some months, my dad has paralysis and could no longer work. Still, I did as best as I could.But now I no longer can. Our business had to be closed down permanently in the pandemic. I am struggling to get a job. My parents moved back to our village while I got a small room to live in the hopes of finding a job. That failed as well and I was evicted (didn't pay rent) a week ago. Staying with a distant cousin until I can find some alternate arrangements and it seems I will find one soon... Only it will be a prison because I have defaulted on all my debt since months. There have been days where I survived on bread and jam because that's all I can afford.Oh and on top of that, I was doing some freelancing and my laptop stopped working. Can't afford to get it repaired. Just real FML.*******My biggest disappointment is that I couldn't repay to my parents for all the sacrifices they made. I had so many dreams. The primary goal being earning decent enough that my parents can go to sleep every night without stress and worry. Secondary was becoming a physicist. I have failed them and myself.Now I think I will spend rest of my 20s and early 30s clearing up all the debt. I have no hopes of ever being able to resume my education. Will probably get a job which I don't like but need to survive and live the rest of my life until I finally die. No hopes of ever giving my parents the happiness they so deserve. I am so fucking scared that this is my life for the foreseeable future.That thought is eating me up. I don't usually cry. I probably have cried 2/3 times in all of 2010s. But now I have cried so many times in the last few months just thinking about my bleak future. Sometimes I am just fine but then suddenly get sad and start crying.The worst part is I can't share what I feel to anyone. I am a social anxious person who is also very introverted and shy. I don't have many people to talk to except my parents and one best friend. But I can't share what I am going through with them. Sharing it with parents will only make my father feel even more guilty (he already feels a lot of guilt). For some reason, I can't seem to be able to share it with my best friend. He doesn't even know the whole story. I haven't been able to share it with him. That's why I felt here I could share the whole essay of my life.That's when these ideas of what would happen if I died started popping up. Will my parents be able to move on? Will it hurt? What painless options? Will Our business insurance take care of the debts? Will my absence even make any significant difference?Honestly, if I knew that I could bite the bullet and avoid any negative impact on my parents, I probably would have done it by now. But deep down I know that's not going to make their life any better. It will only be worse.I wi have to live. I will have to live through this miserable life...this hopeless life. But still... I could have peace if I only decide to end it all.To anyone who reads this, thank you for listening. Sorry if it's too long.

I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning and forgetting everything after giving the \"exams\") and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say and that I am insane. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share their feelings with (and they do it all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my \"beliefs\" to myself and don't tell them about it. A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. I could not even walk properly for a few days because of my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. This \"family\" has completely isolated me ever since I started trying to tell them my thoughts and how I feel. I am completely lonely in this selfish and cruel world. You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (who are supposed to be taking care of their \"parents\" and listen to them at once; basically slaves).

But he says I moved back because I cannot keep friendship with my room mates. Unlike US or other Western countries where 18+ people can move out, here we just can't afford the same.

If you're aware what's going on in India, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's a huge religio-nationalistic ideology currently rising in India. It's called Hindutva. Our Government is also formed by a Hindu nationalistic party. It basically has the following: Hindus were subjugated by Muslims for nearly 1000 years( Invasions and rule of India by many Muslim kings and warlords ) and by Christians for nearly 200 years( Colonization by French, British, Portuegeese, etc. ). And now, India will become a non-Hindu nation because Muslims and Christians will overtake the Hindu population (Complete Nonsense). Hence it is a necessity to make India a Hindu nation from the Secular one it is now. He believes in this ideology. I'm a nationalist but I don't believe in this religio-nationalistic ideology. I left Hinduism 3 years back. Agnostic now. But my father has called me a traitor many a times because I no longer believe in anything of Hinduism.I have big dreams.

This is going to be quite a long post and I've never really done anything like this before so please bear with me. Let me give you some context on my life.I was born in India with a quite decent middle-class family. When I was like 4, our family (me, my mom and my dad) moved abroad. He had a pretty good job there, and I was always a privileged kid. Ever since my childhood I got everything I asked for.  Had absolutely no troubles growing up, except the occasional fight between the parents, but that was minuscule and would get resolved in no time. All through kindergarten and grades 1-4, we stayed abroad. But my grandma was all alone back in India and so after completing grade 4, my dad decided it'd be best if he keep working there and me and my mom go back to India to live with Grandma.A few years after shifting to India, my dad got posted in another country so he had to leave his previous place and go work in that country, which was pretty close to the previous country. My dad was always this person who believed that he should keep working hard without taking any breaks so as to secure a good future for his family, especially my education and stuff, which I've always respected a lot. However, he was always so addicted to the concept of gathering and saving money that he would go to many lengths to ensure there's always money saved, which ended up in him quarreling with my mom and grandma many times. But again, it was still not a big deal and they would always come round to talking again. The main complaints we had were that he was not taking good care of his health and hardly spending any meaningful time with family, resulting in very few memories to cherish. Plus, my dad has always been a controlling figure, and he tries to literally control each of his family members' decisions by constantly nagging and throwing tantrums. But even this aspect was under control.Now, I was not always the brightest kid at school, and was always a little socially awkward and insecure as a kid, so when it came to my 9th and 10th standards, my grades had started declining and my parents (being Indians) would constantly nag me about it. I had this burning passion when I was in 10th that I wanted to be a music producer but since I'm Muslim and that's technically not permissible, my family did not acknowledge this at all. Slowly declining grades and constant nagging at home led me down a not-so-happy spiral, but I resorted to writing and ranting to my friends so it was cool.A pretty significant turning point came about in my 10th grade. For those of you who aren't accustomed to Indian education, there are basically two very important exams in your schooling years that basically \"shape your life\" as many state it (obviously not). Those are called \"board exams\" or simply \"boards\" and you give them at the end of 10th and 12th grades. So my board exams had just finished and we were in Mecca to perform a holy pilgrimage (hajj). My results were due and when they came out, they were actually decent but very low for my parents' expectations. I told my dad that I wanted to switch my stream from science to commerce but i'm always extremely intimidated by him so when he denied I didn't ask him further. The look on my parents' faces were always of disappointment and I felt worthless. I felt so worthless that one day I tried to overdose on sleeping pills and end my life. However, I had been quite dumb since the chemical composition of the sleeping pills we had at home was different than the one's I had read that would kill you.When we got back to India, the admission hustle for my 11th grade had begun and I was forced into a school and stream I didn't want to be a part of. Anyway, I thought this is a new beginning and tried to keep going despite my self worth falling completely apart. Also, during this period, my writing account  on Instagram had pretty depressing love-related poems and anecdotes, in which I used love as a metaphor and personified it to an extent. When my cousins shared screenshots of that account (which was private) with my mom, she asked me whether I'm in love. I said no, I'm heartbroken about other things, to which she never paid heed and said it's a phase and it'll pass (your usual brown parent undermining mental health talk). The constant nagging from my parents had now exponentially increased since they thought I'm lying about my mental health and I'm just \"distracted\". Anyway, I resorted to self-harm. There was this feeling of adrenaline and pleasure I'd get every time I would cut myself, just because I thought I deserved all this and I was the largest disappointment to my family. I told no one about this, until this girl I started seeing in 11th grade. Soon, she became my only way to vent and I always confided in her, but never opened up fully as I felt the monster in me would scare her away.Midway through 11th, my dad got into an accident and soon got sacked off his job, since there was a job crisis in that country. The man who had only known how to work and work (and not enjoy a life) was now left with nothing to do and nowhere to go. Plus, his health had started deteriorating from not caring for himself since decades. We called him back to India, and he went through a few checkups and that was the last time I ever saw my family happy together. My dad had been diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. And as you can probably guess, I haven't really felt entirely happy since then, and it's been a little more than 2 years. (okay now I'm gonna be quite brief since there are too many incidents to mention).So over the following months, I started regularly performing worse and worse in my classes, to the point where I was just barely passing. I used to be at school and/or tuition for the maximum part of my day, so escapism is basically how I coped. At home, my dad would regularly fight with my mom and grandma, and keep crying over how his treatment's cost money and keep fighting over money and would spoil the whole mood whenever anyone would try to have the least bit of fun. On top of that, he would get physical with his own mother (my grandma), sometimes even choking her to the point that she'd get unconscious. Eventually, all this took a huge toll on my social life and I started abusing painkillers, in the process of which I even lost my girlfriend(I broke up cause I didn't want to spoil her life, she never knew about the painkillers and domestic abuse, no one knew/knows).Somehow I passed 12th, and would stay out all day to keep myself away from home. I also picked up a smoking addiction on the way, even drank regularly at one point, but eventually left the painkiller addiction. Through the year that followed I attempted self harm multiple times. Fast forward to when I somehow managed to clear an entrance with flying colours and got into a really reputed business institution. It had taken a lot of convincing for my dad to agree to me switching to the commerce stream, and I originally wanted to switch to arts, but at the time everyone around me said that this institute was the best.Skip one more year in my institution, and my dad's cancer is gone, but he's genuinely gone insane. He talks about nothing but money all the time and keeps telling me how he's smart and everybody took advantage of him (no one did). We've tried therapy for him and he doesnt want to do it. And  as for me? Well, I have attempted and successfully almost overdosed on Serax pills. After this, I started telling myself - \"You only have to put up with this shit until you move out and you're financially independent\" and that's what kinda keeps me alive. Lockdown has beenbad because since I failed, my dad was the most depressed ive seen him and forced me to write a mail to my college using his situation as pity. Fights have been happening almost every day since 2 years, and sometimes it gets vv physical, and ive even pushed my dad away once. I've since grown to think that how can ONE man single-handedly destroy the life of ALL OF HIS CLOSEST family members in the space of 2 years. No one smiles in this house anymore and our daily drama is so funny now that it looks something straight out of a horror movie. I want to kill my dad and im worried that i will, one day in a fit of rage. Ive started losing sleep, started going super mad and getting bad anger fits and started ignoring my health completely and my new semester's about to start. i dont know how much patience i have left in me but i just wanna move out of this place so bad. so bad. i really dont know if its been worth living through this because these 2 years have left permanent mental damage on me and im lost and confused and i just want to move out man. so bad. i cannot survive here anymore.Sorry for getting too idiotic at the end, and thanks for hearing me out. there's a lot of stuff I was lazy to describe but you can ask me anything/even rant to me if you're going through something similar in the comments.

Thank god my neighbor stopped him, I called my mom's relatives for support but nobody cared about be who had bruises and was in pain, I was packing my dad's bag for him to leave the house because my mom was taking care of the so called relatives and everyone was gushing over me saying I have so much love for my dad that is why i was the one packing his bag!!! what the fuck!! I didn't have a choice I hate this situation.During college I trusted a guy and was in relationship with him, but he in turn started spreading rumors and shared my number with every random guy in college. I used to get calls from random guys asking me to sleep with them for money. When I was going through this harassment, my mom used to beat me saying it was my fault for getting those calls!!! I was 16!!! How could you say that it was my fault mom? I used to change my phone number and still used to get calls, later I found that my cousin was the one who was also sharing my number to random people.When I was crying my mom used say that I was doing it to make her look bad in front of everyone. I had 18 subjects as backlogs by the time I reached 6th semester. During 5th semester I met another guy (lets call him P) who said he did not trust the rumors and wanted to really know what I truly am. I was looking for someone to understand me and trusted him. P helped me get out of the mess I was and made sure that I cleared all my failed subjects and made sure I had a degree along with everyone.But here is the thing, P always asks me to send nudes, I hate doing that, I am not at all comfortable with it, but he makes me feel guilty about it and forces me to send them. P knows I hate it but still does it no matter how many times I say no he guilt trips me into sending them saying cannot you not do this for me? I hate my body I hate everything about myself because I look like my dad and she says that I behave like him in every aspect, because I am fat, because I have acne on my body and face and my mom would say that I am doing it attract someone because I wanted to get out of this poverty situation and leave everyone behind.After college I moved to a different city for job, those 4 years are the happiest I have ever been, i had the chance to cry how much ever I want to, I could eat what ever I want to, I could sit the way I want to, no judgement and no one to stop me. Now coming to last year, I was forced to quit my job, my mom was alone and she wants me to change come back home and search for a job here and was putting a lot of pressure on me. The funny thing is, my mom was so nice to me when I started working so I though okay let her be in peace after so many years and quit my job and go back home. Now she started saying that I was too arrogant to quit my job without thinking and she started saying that I cannot do anything and was too dumb to do anything. I cannot cry or yell or do anything. I wish I hadn't quit my job. Now in this mess P started ignoring me saying I always talk only about me and won't even care about him. I never told him what I went through. I don't know whom to talk to. I cannot tell my friends that I am a mess, I don't want anyone to take advantage of my messy state.Whenever I cut veggies for cooking all I want to take the same knife and slit my wrists or want to bang my head to the wall or pull my hair or scratch myself till that pain dominates the other feelings so that I can feel something else other than this feeling of suffocation. I am so done with life, but I'm too weak to die. I want to live a happy life.

I’ve always been a very timid and quiet person because My parents believed children should be seen and never heard and doles out punishments when I speak out of turn or cry. I believe i am a difficult person to love because even my own mother has a tough time showing her concern for me - whenever I’m ill or in hospital, the first thing she does when she sees me is to berate me for ending up in a hospital. T every instance, I had to give in to the demands of my sister - I couldn’t take up driving lessons because there’s only one car in the family and my sister is the only person allowed to drive besides my dad; when my mum found out I applied to a local university she was furious because we only had enough money for her to send my sister overseas to Australia for an expensive education. My sneakers and watch can only be bought from thrift stores but my sister gets the latest most expensive types. I suppose I suffer from an inferior complex because of all this.I’ve also been having issues at work (I work at a call centre dealing with customer enquirers and feedback) with regards to words and actions of a few individuals and have developed anxiety and depression as well as a fear of people in general.A new manager came in and started telling us we (the in-house teams) are too expensive to maintain and he is considering outsourcing our jobs altogether simply by virtue of our call/email volume handled even though our customer surveys have always placed us above the third party vendors from teams based in India and the Philippines. This drove up my anxiety because I have bills to pay and can’t lose this job.I’m also having issues with the admin lady - I feel like she deliberately “misses”, “forgets” or “can’t download attachments” whenever it comes to my administrative matters. For instance, my staff pass expired yet she held off sending on my renewal application for 7 months. What’s worse is that she announced at a meeting that she will NOT open the office doors for anyone who misplaces or forgets their staff pass, even though we have no way of accessing the office without our passes unless someone else opens the doors.She has also repeatedly cancelled my leave applications, both current and from the previous year presumably because she misread the dates and cancelled them by accident, could not figure out how to download the doctor’s letter for medical leave justification, or simply forgot why she rejected the leave application in the first place (and she yelled at me too when I asked if she remembered the reason for the rejection).She’s also been copying all the bosses in whenever she finds shortcomings in my administrative matters but refuses to reply when I offered explanations that pay the blame squarely back at her. But she convinced the manager to issue a new directive that all administrative lapses lie solely with the staff and not her as we must also keep track and ensure that she does not make any mistake.Also, the new manager had taken to raising a complain I had from February and flashing it on screen at meeting after meeting all through to August reiterating the “template” response I gave - it wasn’t a template; I was trying not to say no to the customer and so offered alternatives even from our competitors in hopes of not offending his sensibilities, to no avail.For months, I’ve had very vivid visions of various scenarios of my death - crossing a road made me visualise a car driving at high speed running me over, climbing up stairs made me see myself falling down them and lying bloodied on the ground. Even walking along a balcony makes me imagine jumping off them...So, yes I have been driven crazy at work, and my mother-in-law’s passing was the final straw. I snapped and had to be hospitalised for drug overdose. I was away from work for 5 months and recently got back to office. Almost immediately I received emails from the admin lady complaining above my administrative lapses during my absence as no one made any leave application on my behalf even though I have informed the manager about this.So now, I’m afraid of even seeing her. I either suck under the table or tremble when she walks pass. And I’m so afraid of talking to people or even seeing them I hid under a blanket whenever my home door bell rings, and bury my handphone under pillows when they ring. When I visit the mall for a meal, I started hyperventilating and had to walk back outside cause the crowd frightens me. It’s like my entire life is now revolving around avoid people.And since My return to work, I’ve been having chest pains and difficulty breathing. I feel ill and scared and on some nights, really tempted to just empty all the bills in my mouth, shut my eyes and be done with this exhausting existence... now, with the coronavirus, the Hospitals are swarming with patients and I don’t want to go to ER and trouble anyone further when the medical stuff have so much on their plate already. I really just want to hide at home and avoid everybody but I force myself to get to work to pay my bills. It feels so exhausting... please can anyone share if they have been in similar situations before? I really just want to dig a hole and bury myself but my partner needs me now.... he is 24 years older than I am and my secret plan has always been to either kill my self at his funeral (if he passes on) or, to kill myself when the relationship is over because everything I could possibly achieve in this lifetime has been done.

It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.All these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them?Many times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.I even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist. Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.Now coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them.I think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants?I'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds.I'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? What do you guys think I should do?", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1582474574.0, "author": "Justletgonis", "title": "Help me kill myself", "selftext": "I have been struggling in lif.

I had penned everything which a deeply broken heart and mind could think of [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/). After posting, I had logged out. Why?Because I was really not expecting anything in return. Because I knew it's too late for me. It really is. Passage of time is the only constant in this world. Time is a heartless bitch which really waits for no one. Not for a king, not for a beggar and certainly not for simpletons without any skills like me. I, to be brutally honest, perhaps have and had taken time for granted. Perhaps I did not value my precious time on this plane of existence. Please know that these words are not something I had written or am writing now,  lightly or something which is not reality. It is my very real miserable life. It is the real pathetic life of a 30 year old loser dumb fuck like me.  I was saved that day by a certain something. It was a phone call I had to pick up. Just to hear the other person's voice. Just to hear it one last time before I go.I couldn't let go. I couldn't. I feel it is not prudent to give the details here, of my deed to commit suicide. I do not want to encourage or give that little push to someone else who is suffering and who is at the end of a ledge.  So, now, here I am. My problems has not gone away. There is no magic to make them go away. It's just me. Imagine a person fallen deep in a dark pit and on its floor. He is already at his lowest. But now a hammer striking on his head. Going down even further. Deep into the pits. Pits of his own despair &amp; sorrow which seems to be never-ending.That's me.My post was perhaps subconsciously a cry for help. Many many kind folks here have put their thoughts on my post in their comments. I also, have got many DMs. I am going to read them now. I will try to grasp them and will try to muster some strength to reply.There are no words to express my gratitude to all of you who took the pain to read some pathetic failure's words like me, who is a stranger to you and then, you tried to stop me or give your honest advice to help me or try to solace me. Thank you. Your empathy &amp; your kindness will light up everyone's lives you touch directly or indirectly.I still don't know why I am here. Why I am still alive? Why it's not my right to take my life away? Away from the constant drudgery.I also knew that as time passes, I and my words would be erased from your memories and you would also forget that I, a stranger with all my problems ever existed. Time erases everything. Many have advised me to see a psychologist or psychiatrist. The reality is I was already seeing a psychiatrist and also psychologist - counsellor for last one year. I have poured my heart to them. After a certain difficult session where the psychologist refused to help me and told me that I have to be hospitalized, I was speechless. And I am having medications from the Psychiatrist Dr. for now, a year. Although he had assured me that this would have helped. But the sad truth is that it has not helped in anything substantial. My severe depression has not gone away. My reality has not gone away. My hand still shakes constantly because of my anxiety.In my last session with the psychiatrist, he told me that sometimes there are people who even after having prolonged medications, do not will to pick themselves up &amp; are lazy to go on a new path.I don't know if I fit into that description. I don't know why he said that to me. In my say, 15  to 20 mins meeting with him - each time I have tried to express my real thoughts, problems in a completely transparent way. Rushing through because I think 15 to 20 mins are not enough for a person in my situation to explain what is happening. I do not really know what to do now. I am a person who is aimless, who has no goals, has no particular skills to get a long term job and sustain his family for a long run.I am scared. It is a really do or die situation for me. Because I do not have much time left where I can freely take my time and choose a career path. I fear to even think of what would happen if my next step is wrong, should I decide to live. I do not have the strength in my mind to start learning something new. My memory has decreased drastically.When I sit to think upon and decide what should I do, what career should I choose.... it is like  suddenly a huge mountain comes and sits on my head - the weight of its burden bearing on me, pushing me deep into my own pit of misery even more further down.And no one to lend me a helping hand or a rope to climb up.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1579902808.0, "author": "Mr__John__Doe", "title": "I feel like a failure.", "selftext": "I'm 18 I couldn't get in any college last year, tried again this year but chances look slim.

I was prescribed beta blockers at 15 because my stress was through the roof most of the time. I had nowhere to go, no place safe and was helpless - and still am today. Below is a short recap of some key traumatic events in my life, I missed out on many. I haven't slept for the past 48 hours and the cycle of PTSD never ends making life so unbearable by the passing day. I haven't edited or checked grammar..I documented the best I could.]I don't understand why I just cannot get a break. Why is this (life) so hard? At every turn something goes wrong..and there seems to be no escaping it no matter how hard I try to maintain my ambitions, drive and sanity.Life begins.Move abroad to Ajman. Very modest means, family just scraping by. My health is poor - low RBC count, almost anaemic, constantly battling allergies and sinus/middle-ear infections..Physical and verbal abuse begins. My health doesn't improve and I undergo surgery to have my adenoid and tonsils removed + had a grommet inserted into my eardrum. I was getting blamed for my illness - like as if it was a choice and they played the victim when I came to them with complaints (usually severe nasal congestion to the point I couldn't sleep at night - really affected my bedtime routine, ear pain, many instances of perforated ear drum which thankfully hasn't rendered me deaf!) They would also blame the occasional chocolate or ice-cream I had or my lifestyle habits for the allergies when I knew damn well the mould growing inside the air-conditioning ducts and on the bathroom walls were the primary culprit at home. In school, I would have a toilet problem. I would wet my pants because I was scared to use the toilet. Once I was forced to sit on the latrine to take a piss by one of the janitors there. Ever since, I was petrified of going to the toilet and ended up controlling my urine indefinitely until I peed myself. I would even go around the class, walking fastly hoping to curb the sensation..During the childhish physical fights my parents would have, I as this innocent boy I still was would scream at the top of my lungs for them to stop. I got beaten very badly all the time and my mom never cared enough to protect me. I would get objects hurled at me including kitchen utensils and D size batteries when I couldn't write my multiplication tables..Relocated a couple times. This time we land in Fujairah. Attended the local CBSE Indian school there. This is where the Arabs (locals) were hostile to us. We were foreigners on expatriate. A bunch of Arabs coordinated an attack on me just as I was leaving the bus. I knew what they were planning to do but was helpless as another senior who was apparently on their side had blocked me until everyone had left the bus so they could strike me one on one. The buses were gender segregated, so the girls sat in the front. They got off first. And the conductors had left the vehicle by then. They lifted me by the neck and bashed me around, I believe I bit the insides of my cheeks so hard that it was bleeding and perhaps a scar. Not sure of the full details but I was halfway certain that would be my end. I don't know if they just wanted to beat me up or inflict more bodily injury. When I told my parents about this and they penned a letter to the bus conductor, he invalidated my claims in a condescending manner perhaps accusing me of lying..Relocated to India for grade 6. This is where people started making fun of my name, including adults who would act like illiterates and pronounce my name intentionally wrong and ask me what kind of a name it was like I had the choice. I had lordosis and was made fun for it. I was able to correct it to an extent using good posturing + exercise and yoga. I didn't like doing my homework, a lot of times these problems were ambitious and required you to be socially involved. As this outcast I already was and being a sensitive introvert, I was left behind making matter worse for me. I just lost all interest in studies. I didnt do all my assignments especially math. I loved English and anything to do with creative work like essay writing or preparing booklets on a research topic with infographics and images or making charts and presentation. I simply hated cut-and-dry problem solving...After everything I still have to deal with insensitive family members who are just about the most sallow, materialistic, narrow-minded people who want to maintain control over others and constantly yell and bully when they can't understand your reasons for doing something.It would have been a great privilege to grieve/process your negative experiences in peace. I was put under constant pressure even as I was wauyyy past breaking point.Why do people enjoy making me feel helpless? Besides the ongoing abuse at home, I was being bullied at school, by adults on the streets. Got my arm pulled on by a neighbor as I fought to free myself. Got beaten up for no reason once, got kicked in the groin again for no apparent reason, received a blow to my neck, a surprise beating on my back without verbal warning, got hit on the head for not reciting along or being able to memorize on cue, got my hair pulled and twisted for not walking in file. Got insulted because I was distracted in class having been in a vehicular accident previously that day. This was all just up until class 12. As I grew older, the nature of the abuse at home changed. It was now more verbal - threats about cutting me off financially, with the same old insults, etc. The physical + verbal abuse in school now changed into verbal. I had two roommates who didn't give a shit, kept me up all night and ignored my pleas like it didn't exist. They violated the roommate agreement and then played the victim saying that \"I must just concentrate and work\" without taking in their distractions. However, there was one physical intimidation in college where a student in my class walked up to me while I was leaving and grabbed my jacket still on the chair physically preventing me from leaving while he lectured me using my gadgets (in silent mode) in class when he wasn't the authority (professor) there. After all that saga played out, my dad started his usual drama and games. And I was eventually forced within weeks time to join another university at a course I didn't want. I eventually got out after alterations with the professors who kept picking on me because my Stoic demeanor irritates them I guess. In this education system they expect you to learn things at face value on cue, so you have a very small amount of time before they call you out and make you recite those things in a very exacting manner. During my stay there, I had yet another bad roommate who would smoke inside the room, throw matches and his stuff/trash on my bet and mess up the place despite the rules stating otherwise. He would also turn the fans off/lock the door to roll joints making it hard for me to gain access to my own room. I stayed at a number of cheap lodges during which time I came down with a terribly severe allergy that resulted in me sneezing uncontrollably. I couldn't eat or consume any liquids. I decided that it was enough and left university on my own terms, destroyed my ID card. I also got rid of all my school transcripts because I was scared that my parents will force me into another university and without these documents, I was a little safer. My parents never listened, they only started yelling and immediately accused me of being the problem forcing me to helplessly shut my mouth. I was afraid to say anything because I know they would react in the most emotionally unavailable way possible.When we came to India following doctors recommendation, my mom would play the victim saying how I was depriving her of a good life abroad and I was the reason for their (my mom and sis) suffering. She was just too materialistic and wanted the glam and polished life, visiting malls, taking photos everywhere and gossiping with her lady friends from the comfort of the air-conditioned apartment.While applying to university, I was forced to attend Penn state. I asked for a gap year as I'd gotten rejected by all the top universities I'd applied to. I wanted some time to process, perhaps retake the SAT and apply again for the next intake. I applied very late and was forced to come to India on the condition that I go out in the summer sun, I was miserably exhausted and stressed physically to deliver my transcripts. My dad agreed to let me come back to India (I guess I'd gone there for a few days after finishing school) but he then changed his promises like he always does and told me to stay there saying he wouldn't let me go back home. It was house arrest living in Muscat and his toxicity was unbearable. He would provoke me for no reason, come up to me when I'm quietly using the laptop and make fun of my appearance, make slippery slope arguments and insult me. These provocations and their associated emotions were so uncalled for and hard to predict for anyone with a rational mind.Almost everyone I've been involved with in my life has had a controlling and very subjectivist outlook on right/wrong. They have also lacked ANY empathy  and have invalidated my suffering. They will impose their convictions on me and say I'm wrong for doing things my way at no one's expense.What have I done to deserve so much punishment from all sides? I'm already being pressured to become financially independent. It's like people will set you up for catastrophic failure and then play the victim when you falter and succumb to your suffering. Like, why does my internalised suffering bother these people? Can't one even suffer in peace? I haven't even asked to be cured, all I want is to bear the disease in peace.Anytime I bring up anything to my mom, she invalidated it and says it's trivial and that she'd been through much more and it's all nothing. My dad only know to raise his voice these days, before he would also physically intimidate and brutally abuse me.Everything is connected and leads into the next. People break and break and break me without remorse and then accuse me of being dependent on them or not tallying up to the achievements of others at the same age.I reached out to help here. My mom agreed but then dad played his games tried to convince me at first and then lied to my mom that I'd said \"no.\" My mom doesn't care about justice or fairness, she plays along to the loudest/most domineering/biggest asshole in the room to keep harmony without truly understanding who the perpetrators and victims involved are. I reached out to help on my own again locally (I have done many times before) while in crisis and the therapist, instead of even listening to me, started judging me and shaming me for being dependent on my father (I'm 21 y/o). When I would say something like I wanted to learn music, she would discredit that like it had no value. When I told her I make electronic music so it would require no additional costs of buying instruments or equipment, she still stuck to her conviction that it would need an instrument. So narrow minded and judgemental and her approach was to shame me and say I was wrong and everybody around me was right. She produced no logic in her arguments. It was more like a debate with a highly disagreeable person with a rustic mindset and less like an open-ended therapy session. Her advice was \"why don't you go and get job training like everybody else\" basically comparing me with everybody else without giving me any concrete action plans or solutions to work with. It's experiences like this that make me not want to be vulnerable around anyone. I just want to suffer in silence without being forced to do anything that I don't like. When I told her that my parents would frequently threaten to not feed me, or say I was a mistake, her question was \"but did they do it?\" My family would always gang up against me, like if dad started physically engaging with me my mom would do nothing until I try to hit back when she will push me away. As a little boy, when I was crying miserably, I would get called a drama and ignored. My dad would literally threaten to kill me.In school I would get caught all the time. I wasn't harassing anyone, going around disrespecting teachers or anything.. but they got me in trouble by virtue of their intolerance. They would accuse me of something I didn't do or say and when I defended myself, they would snap back demanding that I don't be disrespectful. Hence I became labelled the problem child. The trouble maker when the real trouble makers were out there on the loose.People will treat you abnormally and then demand that you behave normally.My entire life has been a trauma. Never once have I felt safe, loved or wanted. Which leads me into a full-blown cognitive dissonance when someone like abroad acts nicely to me and I'm like, do I even deserve this? I think I'm also becoming a masochist and putting myself in painful situations because suffering has always been the norm and going against it feels almost a little unnerving.The unpredictability of my parent's emotions is also a cause of anxiety while dealing with them since I'm still dependent on them.The thing is nobody wants to listen to me. Even when I reach out after so much deliberation and when I have failed to handle it, they run over it quickly. Nobody listens or seems to have the patience to even lend a ear to a bleeding heart. Is this truly how twisted the world is? I was afraid to speak or complain about what people were doing to me to anyone because they'd ridicule me or shame me for it and scold me further.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1575675874.0, "author": "Drblackcobra", "title": "A personal post", "selftext": " Reddit:[u/Drblackcobra](https://www.reddit.com/u/Drblackcobra/) chat,message me,whatever..Discord:Cobra#2289A personal postHey guys...it’s me….[u/Drblackcobra](https://www.reddit.com/u/Drblackcobra/).You know that guy from the [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/) subreddit talking about my room and playing death stranding and stuff.This post is after the review that I made for Death Stranding.I uh need to say some stuff about myself.I know this post will be weird and annoying to some and won’t even get noticed,it will be very long,but...here goes.I consider myself to be a personal...failure.Yeah, I know,we started out weird.When I was playing death stranding,I personally felt bad for myself because kojima made a game..and I can barely even go to my laptop and start practicing coding.I think I was born in a way where I would be designed to fail and I personally accept that fate.I’ve been thinking about my home and school life now,I think everyone else is ahead of me.I do have a loving family,don’t get me wrong,but I feel like I’m a messup.

Atleast,my dad said that I’ll never get the feeling of all As because I’ve never achieved them.Heck,I’m not a smart kid at all.Everyone else is ahead of me and here I am makig As and Bs and I might even not do so well on my SAT and ACT.I’m also a absolute dumb person who can’t eveen do simple tasks.I’ve been remembering how my dad used to scold me for getting instructions wrong and that’s my fault because I’m an idiot.Moreover,thanks to my dumb mind I almost failed 3rd grade and my dad and mom had to beg the principal for letitng me stay in.If I was smart,I’d been ahead,learning more,but I’m an idiot.(9:40 AM,11/18/19).(10:00,11/18/19):Again,I’m an idiotic dude who could’ve been smarter if I was bron hte right way istead of torturing my parents by making them give gifts to the teachers and their children,all because of me.I think that’s it.I might make another doc detailing some other frustrations but for now I think this is it.If you want to contact me,see the contact info at the top.Anyway,cobra out! :(", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1575426242.0, "author": "depressedbitch899", "title": "vicious hatred of society and my life", "selftext": "Human misery had been permanent  ever since the invention of society.

So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had \"rotten my brain\"). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like \"Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me\" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that)&amp;#x200B;Update: So while talking normally, I asked my dad what he would say if I asked him I wanted to see a therapist. He reminded me that I had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in India, it wouldn't do me much good. Also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (And it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since I do not have a psychological problem like depression, I can just meditate and go for walks and I'll be okay. The funny thing is, I was amused when he said that I don't have depression lol (Hopefully it didn't show up on my face)Also, I talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when I told him about my cuts. He said that he had a long and tiring day and when I told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (Which is his kind of go-to emotion. Mine is laughing). I know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason I can get behind. He also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which I won't be doing", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1575361085.0, "author": "randomuserwanthelp", "title": "20 years old and thinking about killing my self daily for two years.", "selftext": " Hi.It all started back in high school. I had some previous experiences from elementary school where I was bullied for being the odd one out, but that wasn't my main concern at that point. It was very hard for me to become a part of the social activities during that time. I have always been the kind of person that spends a lot of time on his own, and maybe also too much time in front of my pc where I was trying my hardest to become a professional gamer. I was number 280 out of 3.7 million players and since everything else around me wasn't working very well I used the gaming partially trying to go pro but also partially escaping reality. I knew I didn't have a lot of friends at school, when we were socializing, to me it felt like the only way you could do that was through drinking alcoholic beverages (high school).  I didn't want to drink my self due to problems at home where my father was/is drinking a lot of times at the week and his brother was an alcoholic. So when people asked me why I didn't drink I just said \"I don't want to\" - The immediate response was \"Well you can't say that you don't want to do something if you haven't tried it out yet\" So when I attended parties with this attitude and knew that people wouldn't understand how I felt and at the same time I didn't have fun in the party environment and it was almost like it was the only way to socialize amongst the other students. I didn't really like it that way. So I kind of isolated my self from the rest of the class. We would talk during classes and breaks, but never after school. As time had passed I felt like the lack of common interests hurt my \"standing\" in the class. People would often talk down to me and find it funny to hide my stuff since they knew that I hated when other took my stuff and it gave them a reaction. In addition I have always been that odd one out as I wrote earlier, I've never had the best social skills. Because of  some of the boys particularly my \"friends\" would start calling me autistic, weird and other stuff.  Especially one guy kept going at me, I've always been somewhat bright in school, got good grades and so on, but been awful with my hands (I can barely even tie knot on a plastic bag) so he started saying that I sucked at everything else than school and so on.Later I finished High School and took what we in Denmark call a \"Sabbat År\" which is basicly one year off where you are supposed to find out what you're gonna do after (attend university etc.) I had two jobs during that time. One of them was doing some warehouse work. Here I could really feel that I was the weak link. We were eight people working at the warehouse and they were all living in our small town of 2.000 inhabitants. We had like different work stations where you had to do different stuff, I really felt like I was a burden at all times. It was hard for me to do the simplest of things with my hands and people looked at me as if there was something wrong with me. It was so embarrasing. All I could ever think about during those two months I worked at the warehouse was that the other people probably talked behind my back when I wasn't working there about how clueless and worthless I was... It wasn't something new for me though I knew that I have always been bad with my hands. When I was six years old in elementary school I was told by the teachers that I had to do exercises with other pupils from the school who struggled with the same problems as me - we were probably like five people there out of 400-500. Meanwhile at school I was the best pupil at math, I already knew how to multiply, divide and take the square root of something when I was six. I finished all our math books during one class and I started to get books that was supposed to be done by pupils who were three-four years older than me. What I quickly acknowledged however was, that it was only mental arithmetics that I was good at in math. When things got more advanced or complicated so to say with graphs and differentiation and integral calculus things started to get harder, because now I couldn't just calculate it in my head, now I actually had to problem solve more... It made me realize that I not only sucked at using my hands but also the things I thought I was excelling at.So now I knew that I was for sure only good at one thing, and that was video gaming. I was constantly playing with my professionals, I met them all the time and could often beat them. I had high hopes for a professional gaming career, I just had to improve and become even better. Sounds easy right? Not at all. It was hard as heck, I have played the game for eight years, and probably played around 1000-1500 hours each year. I wanted this to work so much it felt like it was my only opportunity to actually accomplish anything in my life. I felt as if this was the only way I could actually prove that I would for once, actually be useful at something or at least just be so good at something that I could make a living off it. So while I had my year off I started grinding hard. Now was my time to show I was exceptionally good at this and to hopefully join a professional team and become an E-sports athlete. But no it was not, Throughout the year I quickly learned that while I indeed was good at the game, I would probably never have the abilities to become professional at this game. In the meanwhile while this was going on - in the back off my head I was starting to get worse thoughts. My thoughts from High School where people told me I was useless and autistic and so on. I started to feel like all of this for sure was true. I was starting to panick and the thoughts kept getting worse and worse. I was starting to feel like the only way I could actually become useful was if I ended my life. My parents worried about  me all the time, asking if there was something wrong. I really wanted to talk about this with them, but I couldn't. I have always been really bad at talking about my problems to someone in real life. It's super difficult to me.  So them worrying about me and me feeling useless just kept making me feel worse and worse. I was starting to think about suicide maybe half of the days of the week. I would be up at night thinking about my life situation and thinking how pathethic I was. I knew that a lot of people had it a lot worse than me, how could I ever feel this way ? I was privileged, I had loving parents I had an early good childhood with good friends it was only later on in elementary school I would start getting bullied. How could I ever think this way? I started thinking about how some people in other countries struggled just getting their daily meals and how disgusting it was off me to even have the thoughts when all the conditions around me were so much better than say the conditions in coutries like Africa or India etc. This made me hate my self. How dare I feel sorry for my self, when it was mostly my fault ? I Could've just socialized with others no one forced me to take any of the decisions I did, It is my life and my choices that define my life so how could I ever complain about how it was, when all the decision I've made have led me to where I stand now? \"How am I ever gonna a girlfriend or someone to love me, if  I can't even love my self?\" - and am I gonna die alone because of this? I am not even that attractive in real life, and I don't have a lot of confidence in my self, so how in the hell am I ever gonna approach a girl and tell her that I love her? I was just thinking I am gonna die like a loner and gonna spend the rest of my life wishing that I had just done it, just killed my self instead of suffering my self and making everyone suffer around me due to being worried about me. Again I started thinking: \"Is it even worth living?\" \"Would the world be a better place if I wasn't here?\" \"Would my parents have less to speculate about, and would they have an easier life if I took my own life?\" Thoughts like this led me to next period of my life.My year off was over.  \"We want the best for you Søren (my name), and we think you should do something with your life, go study at a university like your sister, do something with your life instead of spending all of your time in front of the computer\", my parents told me. So I did. I applied for a University near me where I would study Business Economics. I was like \" this for sure sounds like something for me, maybe I can later work at a bank or at an insurance company or something along those lines\" So I started there about 2 months ago. I liked it to begin with, after all it was all so new   it was a new experience, new people around me and so on. The first days with the other students seemed so awesome we could talk about the stock market we could talk about movies all kinds of stuff. I really made some friends I thought \"people actually like me!\" Then the studies started for real. The classes became a part of my every day life and the super exciting subjects I thought they were to begin with ended out being \"oh, I guess im going to the lecture today, how exciting...\" I still talked with the other students and we had a somewhat good time together. Thing is just the same problem occured again. They started socializing with each other after school while I was home playing computer, they went to parties went drinking and so on, all the activities that the university had planned for us was centered around one thing, alcohol. Keep in mind that every time I just thought about alcohol I thought about drinking problems at home, my uncle being an alcoholic and ruining his life and so on, so I just couldn't attend those things. How weird would it be for me to spend 30 dollars on a barcrawl to go drink at different pubs, If I don't drink at all? All this culminated into one feeling. \"I can't do this study anymore\" - \"It doesnt even interest me that much\" Half of my subjects were pure maths and it  wasn't math that I enjoyed, it was the kind of math I actually was only mediocre at. For some reason I always want to be the best at something so when I am mediocre at something or have difficulty understanding something, I just quickly give up. I stop doing the homework, stop reading, looking at the exit door during the lectures and just wait to get home... My suicidal thoughts kept getting worse and worse and I felt as if my world was about to break down. I didn't know what I was gonna do. \"Am I gonna tell my parents about study not being interesting\" - \"Am I gonna tell them that I am considering dropping out?\" \"What am I gonna do?\" Again I started to plan out in  my head how I could end my life, I was thinking about how I took the train every morning and every time I was going home from uni. Maybe I could just throw my self out at the train and die? Maybe I could find a gun and kill my self? Maybe I could take a lot of pills hoping I would never wake up? I couldn't handle all of this I just wanted my life to end, I hate everything about it. I thought I was one big failure, I wished that I was never born, hated my self more than anything hated my self for being who I was and feeling sorry for my self, feeling that it was other people's fault and not my own. I just knew that the only way I could keep these thoughts at bay was playing video games. It helped me, I could actually socialize here actually feel like I was being appreciated, actually feel like someone looked up to me and thought I finally was good at something just something.So two months after my study had begun I decided that I finally couldn't live with it anymore. I had to tell my parents. I wrote a text message to my father about my study and said I was in the bus waiting to go home. He told me that we were gonna talk about things when we got home. When I finally arrived and told them everything I started crying louder than I can ever remember. I said: \" I am sorry for being such a failure, sorry for dropping out without barely giving it a chance\" They told me it was alright, but that I of course had to find something else to do with my life. They were after all worried about me, they only wanted the best for me. They were talking about a lot of different stuff that I could do talking about if I needed help from a psychologist. The only thing I could reply was \"I don't know, I dont know what I want to do with me life\" I wanted to say, \"How do I know what I want to do with my life, If I don't even know if I want my life in the first place\" but I couldn't say those words out loud. I knew I couldn't. I could see they were sad and they were extremely worried as loving parents are. It touched me I knew that they loved me before this and I knew they always have, but seeing them like this was like having a knife stabbed into my heart. I knew that I was the reason why they felt like they were. The next morning we talked about stuff more in depth talked about what we were going to do and so on. I could see on both of my parents that they had slept very poorly and that it had affected them during the day. I knew that I was the cause behind this. It made me sure that everything just would be easier if I actually ended everything. I wanted to start and plan how I was going to end my life, but I was going to give it  one last shot before I did so. This leads me to where I am now, typing this message.My parents don't know that I have these thoughts I can't talk about them at all irl...  my parents asked me if I wanted to go to a psychologist because my dad had cancer about one year ago.  For some time I totally forgot about my self and concentrated more about my father and the circumstances he was living under.  I wanted to be there and support him the best way possible but it was very rough for me to cope with such difficult circumstances, it was hard to talk about and hard to ask into. After my dad's cancer had gone away the thoughts came back and I asked if it maybe was possible to see a psychologist since I had some problems I wanted to talk about. My parents immediately thought it was because of my dad's cancer and that I needed to talk about it and the whole process. In reality I wanted to go to a psychologist because of my suicidal thoughts, but I didn't want to share that with them. They asked if I wanted to talk about the cancer or if I wanted to to do it with a psychologist. Then I just said that \"I'm fine, don't worry about it\".It's hard to explain but I find it so much harder to talk about those problems, rather than actually writing about them.  I'm not sure if I would be able to actually go see a psychologist and open up about my problems since this has always been so difficult to me. I really want to get some help, but at the same time I really don't want my parents to worry even more about me. After I dropped out of my study at university they were constantly asking if something was wrong, and that they understood that it could be hard to find out what kind of job you wanted to have for the rest of your life \"a lot of people change  jobs multiple times and never stop, it is very difficult to find the perfect job or the perfect road to take with your very first attempt\" I agree and I completely understand that, I am just afraid that I won't be able to do a job at a satisfying enough level, maybe due to my incapabality of working with my hands or something else.  I am very perfectionistic about my stuff and if something really interests me I can spend hours upon hours on that thing, I know that for sure. For example I started taking interest in chess a while ago I looked up every opening strategy what kind of counter moves there were and what kind of combinations you would be most likely to face and such. During one month I improved a lot just by watching video guides on Youtube and started really enjoying the game. I had the same thing with math when I was younger I loved doing maths I loved solving problems and the feeling when I finally solved something that I wasn't able to do before was just amazing.  That is just one of the problems I feel like. Like if I want to have a job I don't want to be one of the worst employees, I want to be the best and if I can't be then I get so demotivated and I just stop trying. This is not the first time I told someone that I had suicidal thoughts however. I have some online friends I've told they were very understanding as well and it helped for some time to talk with someone about it. Problem is just that it for some reason always comes back. I can have periods where I am really happy and never have negative thoughts, but then  I can also have some periods where those thoughts can be almost unbearable and constant. For me at least it always seem to occour during holidays, birthdays family parties etc. This is where I feel the absolute worst and where those feelings can make me almost unable to breath it seems like. I don't know how to express it in an obvious way, but no matter how many times I battle my inner demons they always seem to come back and stronger. It can take one week, it can take a month it can take several months but those negative thoughts are always coming back and making me think about suicide.  I'm not sure what to write at this point in time, right now it feels like I'm typing just to get this thing off my chest (weird how that works). Life is moving on and friends and people I know too, but somehow it feels like I am not. I'm not sure how put this... At the moment life just feels kind of pointless, I am so unsure what to do, after I dropped out of college and stuff. I really want to go find a job, but I honestly do not care about the money, it would just be a way to spend my time and keep the negative thoughts at bay.  It feels like my life is so meaningless at the moment and I feel like a burden to my parents and everyone around me.I am 20 years old, my older sister is 22. I am still living at home while my older sister is living by herself. I feel a lot less indenpendent than everyone else at my age. Feels like I am just clueless at handling situations that normal people solve easily.  I just can't get rid of the thought that life for people around me, would be better if I wasn't there. Family keep speculating about me... Right now my mom and dad are on vacation for two weeks in Thailand, while I'm home alone. Every day they are typing to make sure that everything is alright... I feel like a child and not an adult. I'm not sure how to explain it in the correct way - everyone around me seem so sure about what they want to do with their lives. It feels like I'm the only one struggling - life just seems so meaningless if I got a job the only point of it, would be to just do something. Same goes for college etc. I just can't seem to focus on a thing because it seems so pointless to me. I can't enjoy life at all and adding the fact that I feel like a burden... Every day that goes by, these exact thoughts crosses my mind. I just want them to stop? Why can't I just be a normal guy? Why do I have to be so abnormal and not fit in...I'm at the point where I am not sure if getting help is even worth it anymore. I just want to stop the speculation. It helps when I talk with my online friends whom I play games with and voice chat with every now and then. We joke a lot about stuff and sometimes I even joke about my situation without them knowing. I jokingly say that life sometimes makes you want to pull a gun at your own head and stuff like that. The response I've been met with has been different from time to time. The majority of them think that people who say they're suicidal only say so, to get attention. They just want people to care for them. It seems like it is impossible for me to say in a serious way that I am actually struggling with such thoughts, when they've expressed how they really feel about people stepping forward with such thoughts...  I feel like I'm running out of options and that maybe, just maybe I should pull the trigger. But I am not even capable of something like that... I honestly don't know what to do. It feels like every day, I'm suffering a bit. Every day a fragment of my soul and a part of my lust for living disappears. The only thing I can find meaning in is Esports (Electronic sports). Nowadays it seems like the only thing that can keep my interest. The times I don't think about suicide is either when I sleep or play/watch Esports. Maybe I should just pursue a career in Esports? I'm not even sure how to do so or if it would even help ?Thank you to everyone who has sat through and read it.   I am sorry for punctuation and so on, don't really feel like reading through all of this, just makes me more sad thinking about it again and I am from Denmark so it is my second language. Not sure what to do at this point... I contacted the Danish suicidal hotline and hoped that it would be of any help. The girl on the line I was talking tried to sound like she really cared and all but five minutes before the line ended she wasn't even very interested in talking any further but just wanted to send me to another place and told me to go to psychologists and so on even though I feel like I can't...If you guys want I can post whole conversation between me and her later...Again thanks for listening... I appreciate every piece of advice I can get.

She'll walk in the room talk to my brother give him money, so that he could fulfill his 'needs' more like luxuries and won't even look at me. We are living in a small 2 bedroom apartment so it's not like I even have personal space. I loved her with all my heart, therefore, my heart is completely shattered. I always disliked my dad, as he is the worst gender biased person ever. Give all money, freedom, and luxuries to son (my brother) and don't let me step out the house or wear any full length piece of clothing without first answering a hundred questions and then listening to their 'taunts' before and after. Which is why I have no friends or anyone else. He plus my grandparents were like that in India too, but I had the strength to face that because my mother was by my side, or I thought so. But ever since coming here, because my father literally sits home all day and we are living in an environment where women have a voice and wear and do whatever they want, thus, he has increased his restrictions and the force to suppress me by asking more questions, yelling, cursing and verbally abusing at the top of his voice while my mother stands there and watches the show. I've tried talking to my mother a million times since the past year. I cried my heart out to her, expressed that I love her, begged her to care for me and that i'll be fine with fake care too just act. I've straight said these same things on her face honestly like every 2-3 days for an year, so much so, that i've cried and have streams of tears running down my face every single time. But there was not one instance that moved her. I go to a community college which is mentally stressing me out, I started working and have a trash body which physically makes me exhausted, and I come 'home' and this takes an emotional toll, dragging the soul out of me. Additionally, I've tried talking to my brother about this about 10 times too, but he sexually abused and did things i did not consent him off 3 of the times and other times didn't even care enough to say word, just nodded. So now i'm scared to even lay on the same bed after the lights are off, leaving only the living room couch as the place to sleep for me. I have no idea what to do. My only way out MIGHT be by transferring to a far off university, but who is going to pay for the fees and living expense? and i'll probably have to go through hell to first even tell that i want to move out. Then, I can not transfer to university for the next at the very least 2 years anyway. So i'm stuck here for the next 2 years. But I don't think I have the strength to see this for even the next 2 days. Being an Aquarius and a feminist, freedom and independence are really important to me, thus my environment is suffocating me. I do not know what to do, and how to make this situation better. I love my mother, but my mind hates her because of the things and way she's been treating me since the past year, but i still can not let go of the love. It hurts more everyday, as I cry and explain her that it is hurting me and she does literally nothing. There have been 3-4 times when I told her while walking out the house that she won't see me again as i'm going to attempt suicide, and I didn't see even the slightest change in expression, let alone any concern. I'm too much of a coward to attempt suicide, even though i honestly have tried to. So i can't die either. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I know dying is the best and my only option but i haven't been able to do that either.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1573427366.0, "author": "Catvidshelp", "title": "Want to end it before shit goes down, even if that shit isn't going down...", "selftext": "I'm usually depressed, at best apathetic, but occasionally I can get seriously anxious.  Bad anxious; I'm not always suicidal when I'm depressed, but I will ALWAYS want to hurt myself when I get anxious. And it's worse, because when I'm depressed thoughts of my family can anchor me, but when I'm freaking out, I'm like a dumb animal and I'm not thinking of anything but getting OUT.  Sometimes, I'm anxious because I start thinking about my work, how everyone thinks I suck, and I am not learning anything fast enough in my studies and will fail at the deadline.    But other times, like right now, I'm thinking of big things. Mainly, about how finite EVERYTHING is. FINITE. I'm running out of time. I'm running out of money. I'm running out of space, because the population is growing too big and my country's in a housing crisis. I'll never get a house, or land. Not that I deserve it. Don't want to clear more bushland to make more houses and push out all the endangered species we have. I'm running out of water; my country is in a drought. Water restrictions. I work in a hospital. We use so much water. We need to use it. I used to work in a restaurant. SO MUCH WATER. So much waste. Food. Plastic. God, the amount of plastic we toss in hospital. Syringes, catheters, test tubes, fluid bags... we can't reuse that shit. Obviously. Needs to be sterile, aseptic. But the landfills are overflowing.  But water freaks me out the most. Water is life for EVERYTHING. Look, just my state, not even my fucking country, has 220 hospitals. JUST hospitals. Not even counting smaller clinics, elderly homes, animal hospitals, or shelters, or wildlife centres. What other businesses use a shit tonne of water? Hospitality. SO much more hospitality than hospitals. Construction jobs. LMFAO car washes are still going strong. 135 major dams, and many of them are at 'low' levels.   If I leave my country, there's no point ecause the whole fucking world is running out. South Africa had that huge drought. They were saying hospitals and animal shelter were at risk. HOSPITALS. India is in drought, too; late monsoon season. Also, I just read in an article India is overflowing with rubbish, and then they have this smog problem. Oh my fucking god cars. The roads are so congested, so many cars. I can taste the fucking smog. I drive for miles without seeing more than a dozen trees. We're running out of trees, and O2 and the planet is getting hotter and the water is evaporating and we're all going to slowly die before the sun even gets a chance to explode. Petrol and gas, we're gonna run out of that. And all the species that are going extinct because we need to keep taking, because all our fucking resources are finite and we need to keep taking them to keep living to keep fucking to keep making more of us. Poor fucking animals trying just to live simply and we keep going and going and going and we're taking them down with us.     I just took my first shower in two days, and I counted 3 minutes but they felt so much fucking longer. It was like I was washing my body in gold or something, like this is too precious to be wasted. I felt sick. I still feel sick. I want to throw out all my shit and then never buy anything again, a clean slate so I never again waste and add to the landfills ever again.   I want to move to the ocean so I can SEE that the water is still there. Salt water is better than no water. Right?    I want nuclear power, fucking stupid I know, but that shit DOES NOT RUN OUT. Also solar power I guess but why doesn't that feel secure to me? I don't know. We're definitely not running out of sunlight. Until the sun explodes, but like I said, we're all fucking dead way before then. I think someone said we have like 50 years before shit starts getting real dire? But I can already see the signs. And they fucking terrify me.   I've gone to bed and gotten back up twice now. I don't like this. I know how obnoxious and stupid and dramatic I'm being and I hate it. But I want to die before everything goes to hell. Like, the end is just around the corner and I'm about to be trapped in humanity's final garbage fire. I'm human. Everything is running out EVERYTHING. Before the water runs out. I want to jump off a bridge, into the ocean, and die. I want the fish to have a decent meal and there's nothing left so I'm not taking up space in a grave.  Sorry. I know.

My parents are relatively wealthy, and they’re the type of parents to help, and I’m sure they’ll help me through.  But what I’m truly scared of is next. I have to find a job as soon as I’m done with college. Within a year. If I don’t, then I have to self-deport myself back to India. Even if I do find a job, there is a going to be less than a third of a chance of me getting that job. Then if I do happen to get a job, I will be stuck in the same cycle my parents were. Except for the fact that it’s going to be way way worse in a decade. My parents would have to wait about 20 years in total to become residents. I have to wait more than a century, unless some serious reforms happen. So my only chance at being a resident of this country is to marry a citizen.  So, me being me, I always worry about the future. I don’t know why, but I always have. Sometimes it’s an advantage, being able to predict events days in advance, but my anxiety is really getting to me. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with depression or anything, but I do feel depressed. The ironic thing was I used to be this Uber conservative person. I didn’t care when people got deported. But now, I really do have sympathy for those people. I used to think depression was for the weak minded. Definitely changed on that. I just cut myself for the first time ever.

Had a terrible childhood of negative conditioning and violence - my mom being worse than my Dad. Too many emotionally damaging incidents to detail here. Dad was doing well for a while but spent it all on booze, parties and buying ridiculous gifts for the extended family (Think Rolex, Omega watches etc). Had a nervous breakdown and quit his job under that condition. I was sent to boarding school at 5 years old - so sense of being unworthy and unwanted started early. Plus had a narcissistic mother who put me down and compared me to every sentient being in her consciousness. Both of them reflected their disdain for each other and their failed marriage on to me.Rescued my Dad from a suicide attempt at 13. Survived one myself at 16.  Had a long term relationship (5.5 years) end because of economic incompatibility. Her family was rich, mine wasn't. My parents cried poor all the time anyway -  lived in frugal squalor, let the house fall into extreme disrepair etc.Moved overseas(Aus)  in my mid-20s, to get away from it all. Went through the usual post-911 racist shit, Experienced social, professional marginalisation for half a decade. The social &amp; spiritual isolation was/is hell!Supported my parents financially nonetheless - wanted to rescue my father. Did this at the expense of my health, hunger and basic needs. Bought oversized clothes at thrift shops for a decade and went hungry a few days a week.Eventually got myself a career.  Killed myself with long hours trying to prove \"brown boy can work\". Got overlooked anyway. My responsibilities to my parents and my desire to 'build the castle before I get the queen' kept me away from relationships. Plus the negative bias/racist shit I had experienced kept me fearful and insular.Finally went back home - to my 'real' home, to my 'real' friends. Realised home country(India) is an awfully corrupt, morally bankrupt, racist and sexist place. Realised my past friends were just parasites and mutated to ugly adults. Mom still treats me like shit. Dad is spiritually dead. I had failed in rescuing him. Also find out, he basically lied to siphon money out of me to fund his hedonism. They hijack my career for 5 years by keeping me mired in unraveling their court cases and realty issues - they would have ended up homeless - plus we have no support system, so was all up to me. Get incredibly depressed to the point of suicide again.Finally ended up moving back to Aus and starting my career from a few steps down. All the momentum I had earned is now gone. I linger and bounce between jobs for another 5 years.All I have wanted since I was 12 was to have a family of my own, have children, have someone to belong to... Over the past 2 decades I have made sacrifices and decisions for a non-existent wife and child.And here I am. 43. single. lonely. no friends. no one to care for me or call on me on sick days or birthdays, Xmas and assorted holidays - spent these alone for the past 2 decades. I barely have AUD$300k in the bank. My career has stagnated over the past few years - most likely due my insular nature. It pays ok, but is spiritually corrosive in it's middle management monotony.Given the negative social cachet of my ethnic origin, dating is non-existent.  Neither have I  felt attracted to; nor have I been attractive to anyone in a long time. I have waited for things to change, life to get better and I am tired of it. I feel unclaimed, unloveable and condemned to a cursed existence. I have spent a lifetime trying to be a good person...a good son to bad parents, a good friend to bad friends...and on and on.I usually can brush it off, but I have been having persistent thoughts of ending it all. I don't have the will to endure another year of soul crushing loneliness. I am just tired, i need a hug and I need to be loved. And I don't think I ever will be.

Over a year I tried, and then I just got sick of trying, sick of failing, sick of expending so much effort for no return.My people know I'm experiencing this. My counselor wants me to join a partial hospitalization program, but I know that when they assess me they won't let me join the PHP because I'm too high a risk. I've got a plan, I've got the means, I've got a date, I'm finalizing things in my life -- they would put me in in-patient and I would lose my entire livelihood -- and I have absolutely no faith that I would be any improved at the end. Quite the opposite, actually, with no way to pay my bills, and the stigma or whatever that would result from my missing work for so long. They know, too, my boss and her boss, and her boss. And to my face they're super supportive and kind and sweet, but they also know I have fucked up huge, and that doesn't go away. I know that that impacts the way they think about me.  And if I were to go into the program, they'd have to find people to cover for me during my absence, which means that they will have an even deeper awareness than they already do of just how colossally I have fucked up at work.Called the national suicide hotline a few times, trusting that they had no idea who I was or how to contact me or whatever (or how to report me), and after I made two calls in one day stating that I was absolutely going to kill myself, but ended the conversations after not much time, I received calls from a guy who 'wouldn't ordinarily contact somebody in this way but was concerned.' Because I didn't get to end the conversations, he said, he was afraid that I was ambivalent and wanted to talk some more but might not call because I had 'made the promise.' I don't know. It was confusing. He even acknowledged that it was an invasion of privacy, tried to be very clear that it was an unusual circumstance, and that he would not pursue anything further if I did not wish it.Originally I was going to use rat poison -- the zinc phosphide, when ingested, creates phosphine gas which is quickly toxic, there is no antidote, and resulting symptoms are resistant to traditional treatments (for example, low blood pressure that is typically mitigated by increasing fluid through IV is unresponsive to that treatment, and blood pressure continues to tank). As it turned out, though, you can't get concentrations high enough in the US to make it work reliably. In order to get a dose that would even \\*possibly\\* be toxic, you'd have to eat a whole pound of pellets -- noisome, grainy, awful pellets. I mean, I guess that demonstrates a lack of conviction on my part? But I've moved on, let go of that as a method after completing my research. It's a shame I don't live in India.Now I've got a little over three months' supply of my antidepressant (ironic?), a month's supply of wellbutrin, and a month's supply of Adderall, plus enough sleepy medicine and alcohol to knock me out while the other stuff does its work.

Loving as you are, you would never have done this for yourselves, and so  it is the least I could do.I ended my life after 27 years because I was troubled, in more ways than one, hopeless, and overly selﬁsh.When  I began to be depressed, even as early as 3rd grade, I developed an  anger that grew out of control. But by 16, through intensive study and  practice of Tantric meditation, Buddhism, and yoga I was able to subdue  my anger and sadness, most of the time.With  my anger out of the way, hope trickled in like a leak in the roof. I  told myself if I left the state I hated, abandoned the friends that were  not true, and built a life of my own design elsewhere, I might feel  satisfaction and joy.I read in  many places that careful attention to exercise, nutrition, sleep, and  thought patterns could further improve my outlook. Coupled with the  acquisition of a loving partner and a stimulating job, I thought that  might be enough to ﬁnally extinguish the unrelenting dissatisfaction and  anger that still burned underneath the surface.I  took all the best advice. I worked hard at shitty jobs until I got  better ones. I showed true love and kindness to romantic partners. I  took care of my mind, body, and spirit. I followed the best practices.But  every job felt like indentured servitude. I never lost my awareness  that my romantic partners didn't care about me, they only wanted what I  provided, money, attention, physical intimacy. I could not shake the  knowledge that romantic love is just a deal, a bartering of goods andservices.So I adapted, and tried to ﬁnd happiness in solitude, without a partner. I broke up with every girlfriend I ever had.I  worked even harder to build a business where I worked for myself, one  where I could feel ﬁnancial freedom and independence, and maybe a sense  of accomplishment.I strived  harder in the areas in which people already dubbed me militant. I went  from eating all natural to vegan. Paying special attention to diet  micros and macros to ensure my body had everything it needed, not only  to feel good, but to look good, which I hoped would keep my self  conﬁdence and esteem high, for the sake of my mental health. Yet, no matter how fit or attractive I was or was not, I felt much the same. Terrible. Sad. Angry.Along the way, I tried anti-depressants prescribed by doctors. After trying many, and giving them a  fair shot, I quit them and relied on natural remedies that were more  effective and without side effects, and saw some mild improvement over a decade, but they were still woefully insufficient. I  talked to a therapist weekly for 4 years, though none of you knew,  secretly hoping that a trained professional with decades of experience  my know something I did not, but as far as she could tell, I was ﬁne.  Everybody thought I was just ﬁne.I  even tried experimental drugs entitled nootropics that were meant to be  safe, non-toxic, and mood enhancing. Whatever various effects they had,  they were insuﬃcient.So I moved  on to \"recreational\" drugs that have been known to combat depression,  even in clinical trials. LSD, THC, and DMT , and while they helped I  would require and endless supply to maintain any improvement.Luckily,  I had moved to California, and I was industrious, so I created my own  grow operation to supply me with enough cannabis and therefore money for  LSD that I might never run out. But I found quickly that they were no  cure. They were like a bandaid for something that needed stitches, or  perhaps amputation.Believe me  when I say, I experimented with dosages and combinations of every  concoction of supplements and drugs that money and intensive searching  could procure. Still, just at the edges of every moment, was the same  sadness waiting to burst onto the scene. And it always did.While conventional wisdom of health,  newer scientific remedies, and eastern mysticism had failed, I had a few more ideas.Artistic  expression for one, my brother the genius was a brilliant artist and  supportive mentor in this. I feel I have let him down, but for every  moment of joy art birthed, it came with triplets of misery, and with the  fullness of time it became clear that it was an exercise in futility,  one which I persisted in for 10 years.I  thought perhaps I was missing something spiritually, so I made a habit  of studying religions, cults, and eventually the occult arts too. Yes,  I'm speaking of magic.Apart from  satanism and demonology, of which I was familiar, I practiced and  experimented with all forms I could. I stole from the internet every  occult or illegal book, hoping that perhapsthe  secrets were hidden deep in a book, or inside myself, somewhere along  the route previously tread by some of the most bizarre and dizzying  intellects ever to walk the earth and write a book.While  perhaps it is my failing, as I am quick to admit that some of the texts  were of such complexity it is possible I failed to understand them  fully, I do contend that most of what is practiced relates to either the  induction of trance states or the transformation of one's mental  paradigm, a sort of mental gymnastics.Well,  every trance state was ﬂeeting like my joy, and no mental gymnastics  long contorted my mind to tranquility. Soon my trances ended, and my  mind resumed its normal maddening form, not fundamentally altered, just  mildly warped.By now some clever  reader might be thinking that I was just lonely, but I had considered  this, aside from my fruitless romances, I did join groups such as  meetups for specific activities and spiritual organizations like the  SGI, where there gathered a community that shared stories of how they  overcame challenges, hard challenges like cancer, and marched on  victoriously.Unfortunately, I  found myself detesting these groups and the people in them. I felt no  pleasure in subjugating myself to their ideals, endlessly praising each  other and their \"leaders\" and prattling on about their lives, desperate  for a little encouragement and recognition just so they wouldn't feel  alone. They clung to the group like a crack addict clings to their pipe.  Suckling for another drop of relief from their lonely, miserable lives.But  I recognized it might take some time so I did as they did. I  hypothesized I might be doing them a service, giving them space, being a  listening ear, and a little selﬂess service might yield its own  rewards.Yet still, no matter how I  imitated their behavior, I clearly did not get whatever they were  getting out of these interactions, and selﬂess service did nothing for  my mood. If anything, I felt more drained than ever, so I ﬂed.Just  as I had so many times before, from my family, my romantic partners, I  left my home state, my jobs, college, Chicago, California, India,  Mexico, wherever I went there I was, miserable inside.Nearly  20 years since the sadness ﬁrst began, having tried everything I was  ever suggested with no success, every last drop of hope was ﬁnally  spent.While many think of those  that commit suicide as quitters, and this may be accurate, my only  consolation is that I did, in fact, try very hard to ﬁx my problem by  every means I could think to try.Having  heard a great variety of treatment methods, you may at this point be  wondering what was this peculiar misery from which I ran. I wondered the  same the entire time, hence the great variety of the treatments.All  I can say is that I was from childhood completely disillusioned with  all institutions. Religion was a pack of intolerant charlatans. School  is a federal brainwashing prison. The government is an organization with  mass mind control, subjugation, and exploitation as its only mission.  Jobs, soul-sucking wage-slavery, modern indentured servitude meant to  keep worker drones barely atthe  level of sustenance until they are too old and worn out to work, at  which point society comes in, harvests whatever monies they have accrued  in their retirement before ﬁnally consigning them to the grave.What  is there to be accomplished? What legacy lasts? Why should anyone care  when, as we all know, but few can bare to admit to themselves, it all  falls apart in the end?Why not  just enjoy the ride? What ride? Enjoy the governments mind control  advertising media? Enjoy the school's federal propaganda while you  breathe elevated CO2 levels still, trapped to a chair? Enjoy the same  monotonous, purposeless job day after day? Enjoy empty relationships  based on the unspoken fact that they are predicated upon a personal  gain? And they are. If at any point you stop providing money, or you are  no longer physically attractive, know well that the love is gone. For  whatever romantic reads this, you need only look at the divorce  statistics to wake yourself from your delusion.Should  I have found joy in the caring for a child? As if I would bring a child  into this. Or a dog perhaps? That beast that is among the most loving  of all creatures that would eat me alive a few short days after their  food dish ran dry.What should I  have lived for? Smelling roses? A breathe of fresh air? The roses that, like all the foods, have been genetically modiﬁed and coated in pesticides. The air that is  thick with the exhaust of man's crude machines. Perhaps I should have  listened to the sweet songs of the birds, if only they could be heard buried deep below the clangs of new construction.Humans  have terraformed nearly every square inch of this plane into something  unrecognizable and monstrous. Even in the face of the warnings of great  men, shouting to us from thousands of years in the past,Lao Tzu wrote,&gt;*Do you want to improve the world?*  *I don't think it can be done.*  *The world is sacred. It can't be improved.*  *If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.*  *If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.*Now  we stand on the brink of self-extinction, along with the obliteration  of  every natural resource we hold dear. The air, the earth, all its  ﬂora and fauna shall be laid barren even for us, who seem to be able to  thrive in the most miserable of conditions.How  could someone like me that grew up in such comfort ﬁnd any joy in the  ruined world that we soon shall inherit from our deplorable forefathers?Whatever  hope there is, is not in me. Not anymore. And unlike my peers I will  not keep shouting into the void that is social media and unlike those who will come after, I refuse to bury my head in VR headsets until the  lights go out. Video games with their rigid rules celebrate competition, not creativity, and mindless  conﬂict, not unlike politics. In video games, you are assigned a team like red team or  blue team, and like the Colosseum of old and the modern day sports   stadiums so cherished, blockheads bash each others' brains out  in a competition that should be recognized as a sort of violent energy vampirization, in which the loser is drained of his energy, and so the  winner is elated, having fed off their misery and defeat. The injured  party is so depleted of energy and happiness, what is left for them but to to correct this  energy imbalance by jumping back into the ring in a vain attempt to  recapture their lost energy from a new opponent, destroying their opponents' and their own bodies  and minds in the process.Waste  not your energy in that ring, and seek not the council of therapists,  having known many personally, I say with conﬁdence they are among the  most confused and miserable of people, and the best of them can get  through the daily toils of their job without anyone being the wiser that  they have the emotional sophistication of a termite, understanding as much or less about life in total.Indeed,  there is no one that does not suffer from this endless sadness that can help, no  doctor, loved one, counselor, sage, yogi, mystic, or magician.Know  well, from someone who has sought them all with fervor, if you feel as I  feel, if you see as I see, that you like everyone are truly and deeply alone.

I am a 24 y/o guy from India. I've been holding things inside me for over 2-3 years now and was desperate to let it out somewhere, so thought of writing this post. This will be a long post, so I request you all to be patient and give some of your time for reading this rant. Let me give you a little background about myself:1. When I was young, I was always passionate, or let's say, infatuated by astronomy and studying about galaxies and space stuff, you know like how lot of kids are. In India, pursuing a serious career, especially in STEM is a very big thing and hence, very competitive. I wouldn't call myself a brilliant student throughout school, but I was quite decent. I remember how it took me twice the amount of time as my classmates in school to learn basic math (when I say basic I mean addition/subtraction /fractions etc), and I used to hustle for hours to learn the basic stuff. Getting good grades in exams was always a struggle for me, but I somehow managed it till middle school. I believe this planted the seed of inferiority complex and lack of confidence in me as I started comparing by abilities and academic efficiency with others'.2. I grew up in a family where my parents fought day in and day out and there was no familial harmony. Though, they made sure I wasn't left devoid of any support, this disharmony started to make me feel detached from them. By the time I was a teenager, I had seen enough of this. So much that I did not want my friends to visit me and see how my parents fought. I did not want to talk to anyone, or even want to make friends. I simply used to interact with them for some obvious social reasons, but never enjoyed bonding with anyone. I started weaving a cocoon of silence and detachment around myself. I felt comfortable. And... secluded.3. I then went  to college to pursue my BS in physics. Though, I was not very happy with my choice of university, I was hopeful it could help me launch myself strongly in the field. This was a time when I was happy I was away from home and could meet new people, learn a lot, and maybe change myself for good. A year later, my parents split up and whatever harmony was left, had just committed suicide. There was a wrath of emotional wars, arguments, cursing and blaming between my mom and dad and I was the one who was forced to mediate matters between them. This shook my mental peace and crunched my emotional stability. I didn't have much friends in college so there weren't much people I could talk about this with. Moreover, I have always suffered from nervousness and anxiety so I can never keep myself confident and calm during times of pressure, and tend to obsess over my my failures and mistakes- You know the typical \"**I wish I did not do this**\" attitude.4. A year later in college, I met a girl who had a similar family history of feuds and disharmony and I shared all that I could with her. We became good friends (very close in terms of sharing personal matters) and started dating few months later. Although, this soothed my emotional distress, I started getting distracted from academics. This was the fist time I felt a very strong attachment to someone. However, all this cost me to flunk in one of the courses and I had to drop a year before I could go further for MS. Just as I started prepping myself for entrance exams (equivalent to physics GRE) to get into good universities for MS, this girl said she wanted to break up with me. Once again, it started another round of emotional shit in my life. My mom despised this girl and did not want me to date her, and at the same time I didn't feel like letting go of her. I feared I couldn't get someone else I could open up to all over again. To this day I call myself a loser for having wasted my time in such trivial matters and curse myself for being so vulnerable. Fast forward to a year later, I didn't do well in the entrance exam, missed my dream university, and once again had to settle for a mediocre university surrounded by people I did not enjoy being with.I fucked up my GPA and am now sitting at home prepping for GRE, hoping I can still find something meaningful, something broader, and get a fresh new perspective in life. The whole series of mistakes, my flaws and my choices has drained my confidence and hope to absolute zero. Every time I see my friends doing what they like, travelling, exploring new aspects of life, while I am at a standstill, I feel I can never amount to anything. Hell, I cant even talk to someone looking straight into their eyes. Sitting here at home just brings back those dark flashes of my failed past. Everyday, I wake up thinking I have to wake up because I am, unfortunately, alive.I've successfully nurtured an absolutely messed up, pessimistic mind, with no vision, no hope and no desires. I strongly feel like ending my life everyday, but can't muster up enough courage for it. I think that even people who end up getting rid of their lives have the will, the extreme will to do it. And if helped, can channelize this will to a positive domain. I, however, have no will- no will to live, and at the same time no will to do something about it. I can't imagine the pain I'd have to go through and this stops me from doing anything harmful to myself. I don't talk about this with my parents, because they're probably depressed as well. No one in the family is in the right state of mind to help anyone in this matter.Finally, if there's anyone out there who is depressed because you had a breakup, I can understand it feels terrible, but know one thing that if you build a good career, you'll have chances of meeting lot of better people. Nothing haunts you as bad as a failed career and the pain of not getting the job or the college you wanted.If you read through the whole depressive rant, I genuinely thank you. If you can drop any suggestions on how you fought your depression, I'd really appreciate it.And if you did not read the whole thing,**TL; DR**: *To live, or not to live*That is the question.P.S. Please feel free to drop your thoughts and express how you feel.

I have two parents who have given me food 3 times a day and funded every single bit of my education. I have always been surrounded by people who I'm comfortable with and I guess vice versa. Basically, my life seems fine, at least I don't know, better than most. I have never faced an issue my entire life, in fact, the only big issue i had was.... ok nothing actually. I haven't faced any issues. Almost anything I wanted materialistically, I have it. A good gaming pc, I got it. Good food, my mom made it. Good mobile, dad bought it. Good friends, I think I got it. Coming to the problem. As I said, I have faced absolutely no issues in life. College and school were fun (at least for the most part). The problem is me. I feel I am a burden to everyone close to me. I have no motivation for doing anything. That gaming PC I talked about, I don't have the guts to play anything new, all I do is play vs bots in DotA. I have a very chaotic mind (which I am sure everyone does), but I can never do a task properly, I always leave it incomplete. Anything I wanna do by myself is never happening. My motivation has been an all time low. I tried doing something about things, I tried to set goals, but I am not able to achieve anything. Falling short of everything. I even hurt the one woman I liked, and I know it is my fault. The problem is me, just me. I can't stop thinking, about anything. I don't know how to control my mind. If I'm having bad thoughts, I cannot shrug it off. I have become so scared of my brain that I am afraid of doing anything that involves me thinking. I cannot study for tests properly, I cannot do projects and assignments properly, heck I am so afraid of my brain, I can't even go take a shower because I fear I have to listen to my thoughts for 5 mins. I am a selfish person, but I do care about people. At this moment, I don't know what to do. I just want everything to stop. I tried medicines, listening to therapists, people, but no. Well actually, I say I try, I can't even try this properly because, well, my brain doesen't make exceptions for anything. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if I am sounding repetitive, but I am just voicing whatever's running in my thoughts. I wanna just end myself, but I am very scared of doing that too, survival instincts I guess.

Almost failed my first year, worked hard to receive my MEXT scolarship in third and go to Japan to study for a year. Summer before I leave I get raped. I go to Japan and I get to let it go and escape it for awhile. I date, have sex, enjoy. It’s in the back of my head but it’s something I left back in my homecountry. I’m okay.I meet a boy. We become friends. He’s nice. We start dating.It turns to summer again. I almost have to go back home. Suddenly a man I grew up with back home commits suicide. He promised to visit me while I was in Japan. We had an argument but I was sure we’d patch it back up. Except now we can’t.I get insomnia, have to see a counselor in Japan. She has no idea what she’s doing, but she tries and I’m grateful.The guy I’m dating is sweet but depressed. We help each other wallow and grieve and cry. He’s nice, but when I’m not in the mood he still has sex with me.He wants to continue our relationship.I go back home, see a counselor. Manage to graduate as a Japanologist, but after all that’s happened it doesn’t seem that important anymore. I dredge through the next year, with ups and downs and help from my psychologist.Next September I decide to work in Japan so I can see my bf. He’s sweet but long distance is hard.My working experience is horrible. I was doing better, but the people are closed, demanding, apathic. My depression gets worse again. I always have to go see my bf, he never comes to see me. He’s doing worse and so am I. I am struggling. I came all this way for him and he’s leaving me hanging.I leave the job early, spend two weeks with my bf and go back home. I love him but I feel alone.I double my psychologist appointments again and start a new degree in psychology.I meet new people, the study is intriguing and going well. By summer I’m doing much better than I have at any point in the last two years.I break up with my bf in november. I feel unloved and unsupported, but the decision still fucks me up. I screw up my first semester big time.I go to India in februari with my school. We have a “women in prostitution” talk which is actually just a women talking about her life, kidnapped and raped for money. I get a panic attack for the first time in years. My teacher comforts me. I overcome this moment. It is a defining moment in my healing process.I’m seeing a boy. We date, casually. I fall in love with him. He knows I’m poly, he doesn’t mind. I want to be monogamous with him, but I want to take it slow.We spend our weekends together, study for upcoming exams. I’m optimistic it will go well. If I do well in these exams, I think I can overcome the bad first semester and do well in my second chance exams in summer.Another girl kisses him. I tell him I’m in love with him and want to be with him. He tells me he sees a future between us, wants to travel with me. He tells me he wants me not to see other people. I agree, tell my other dates I’m going monogamous. All through this I was honest to everyone. I feel good about my decision, and motivated for the exams.Exam period is hard. The guy is struggling, and I’m focused more on his feelings than my own. I try to support him via text, we don’t meet for about a month. I feel like all my exams go exceedingly well.He starts ignoring my texts. Exams finish, he doesn’t ask to meet up. I go to Spain with my mom but can’t focus, all I think of is him. I pray for it to go well, I haven’t been this in love in ages.I come back home, he tells me he’s been dating the other girl that kissed him for about a month. They started dating the week after he told me he sees a future with me and wants us to be monogamous with me.I break.The next day, man I LARP with attempts suicide. He’s in a coma for two days before he passes away.I break.I get my results two days after that. I failed all my second semester exams.I’m broken.All I can think of is how hard I’ve worked and how it’s all been for nothing. I will fall in love again, sure, but in this moment, the guy I was planning my future with isn’t in love with me and that hurts so much. It makes me feel not good enough, not attractive enough, not interesting enough.Another person I know, struggled their whole life, took their own live in their thirties, and it speaks volumes to me. Their friends ignoring all the warning signs, no empathy until he slits his wrists and it’s too late. And life goes on. It goes on without him, just like it will go on without me.It keeps coming back to me as this inevitable thing. Why keep drudging on if I’m going to end up commiting suicide at 35 anyway?And my grades... I can’t even think about them without crying. I love what I’m doing. My first semester this year I fucked up and I know it, but this semester was different. I worked fucking hard and did I have issues?

Even though I am also getting help (as well as my brother) from a social worker, I have a hard time opening up with him.My other problem is that I always procrastinate with homework. I'm in grade 7, and even though we are getting close to the end of the year (the last day of school is on June 28 this year). As of writing this (June 11) I have 3 HUGE projects due tomorrow. Instead of doing them, I am typing this up.  I have slight ADD, and I feel like no matter what I do, it isn't enough for my parents and my family. I feel that even if I try my best to say something nice, I fuck up horribly and turn it into an insult. I am one year younger than the rest of my class. Whenever I go to sleep and wake up the next morning I wake up asking myself how I will fuck up today. Since I am one year younger than everyone, people make fun of me for being a pussy. I'm not that strong, and pretty light. Whenever my parents scream at me I feel worthless (chances are I am). Literally the only thing I am good at is swearing, playing video games in class, and rapping (not that good). I just wish someone could tell me that I *am* worth something. I don't usually post on Reddit, and never posted on these types of subreddits. If I seem fake, then think of me what you want to. This is not my real account. I don't want to tell people of my main account because I'm afraid people will find out I posted this. I don't even think the person I like (in my class) knows i'm a person. No matter what I do, I wish for myself to have the most anti-climactic death ever. I wish I could be a better person to everyone.Another thing is that my friends tell me why I always act so happy. I always \"joke\" that I am depressed and they believe that it is just a joke. I don't know what to do or say. I wish I could speak my mind to my parents and the social worker and ask them f or help without being afraid that people would call my a \"dumbass pussy bitch\" for  saying that I am depressed. I don't think anyone knows that I might be hurting this much except myself. No matter what.. ***nobody*** would be sad if I jumped of a cliff right now.

My life has been nothing but a joke these past sixteen years, I feel as though I have been living in some type of hell I cannot escape from so thats why im writing this note. I'm hoping all my pain will be gone in death. Heres the story of my life, I was born august 29th 2002 in some city somewhere my parents used to be rich in real estate but everything went to shit when the market crashed. We moved place to place, to other countries even. You could say my childhood was when I was the most happiest but I always felt as though something was wrong when I was 5 or 6 I started dealing with suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone because i felt as though they would act like something was wrong with me. But fast foward a few years and I'm back in my old hometown and I'm eight years old and my father starts touching me this carries on for five years and the sexual abuse starts progressively getting worse and worse. He talks to my mother about sending her on a trip to India by herself and says he will \"watch\" me and my brother. I knew I was going to end up getting raped, I thought of suicide everyday. I even tried drinking bleach, anyway to set myself free from the hell I was living in. In a matter of days I tell my mother, I couldn't suffer anymore at the hands of my father. I told her about what he had been doing to me and she calls him and screams at him and whatever. But thankfully they are divorced now and i live far away from him.So now present day I have lived in a new city since late 2015 and went to school for the first time in years of course it ends badly for me because you know my life is a fucking mess. I find out I have multiple learning disabilities and low IQ, so you could say my school situation was hell. I got no help for my learning disabilities and on top of that I was getting relentlessly bullied by everyone in my grade. I made some friends but they haven't spoken to me since freshman year. Every friend I have ever made in life has left me or used me for their own personal gain. No one has EVER stuck around, no one has ever gave a single fuck about me. Sophmore year was fun when I had people to make it fun, I used to have a lot of friends but because of my depression everyone has just abandoned ship even the love of my life. He was the only man to ever make me feel something, he intrigued me, made me feel like living and I was/am in love with everything about him. We dated for a month he was my first boyfriend and my first love but of course my depression came and fucked it up, I was happy in the beginning of my relationship with him but then as always my depression, my suicidal thoughts came back.

This is my first post here so do bear with me. I'm a 27 year old Indian and I've been a hikkikomori aka a NEET for 3 years now and I've spent an entire life behind a screen watching movies, tv shows and playing video games. Recently, I've been into anime and a bit of J-drama and K-drama as well. I'm introverted af. Its not that I can't talk to people but I prefer not to. I have never dated or even had a relationship in my entire life. In my 27 years of life, the only two times I've had sex were with hookers whom I paid to have sex with me in order to lose my V-card. I was never good with making women laugh. Hell, I've never even had a female friend. I discovered that I found more pleasure in masturbation than in the two times I had sex. Oh, and I'm a chronic masturbator as well. Been that way my entire life. Anyway, as far as I can remember, since early childhood, the only sense of joy and happiness I could ever find was from a screen. Whether it was watching a TV show like Friends or Two and a Half Men or watching superhero related media like The Dark Knight, the only joy I ever found was behind a screen. I had friends in my school and college years but they were just a few and I've lost touch with them which was inevitable and expected. After college, I went to study abroad in Vancouver. I fucked it up by failing a course...twice! Anyway, just like the coward that I am, I came back home to live with my parents and its been 3 years now and I feel like I am at the end of my life struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies. Been struggling with depression since I was 16 btw. Used to drink a lot to escape it, as a matter of fact. I don't wanna work despite my parents forcing me and scolding me almost everyday about not having a job. I find working mundane 9 to 5 jobs meaningless and I've not found one thing I'm good at that I can use as a source of income in my 27 years of life. I feel no point in existing, have found no meaning in life to keep on going but I somehow escape reality by watching a show or movie or playing a video game. I try to escape my sad reality that way.I'm a patient of epilepsy so I sometimes wonder whether all the depression, suicidal tendencies and anxiety and overall, sadness is derived from my epilepsy. Either that or its from the medication I've been taking to keep my epilepsy in check in order to prevent me from having seizures. The medication maintains my brain chemistry and even tho it prevents any seizures and such, its side effects are literally suicidal tendencies, depression and anxiety among many others. But that doesn't mean I don't have epileptic symptoms every now and then, like whenever I brush my teeth, I get the feeling like a seizure is about to hit me in my mouth. This happens every other week currently. Anyway, I have been epileptic since the year 2000. Now, I am being a useless pos living with my parents contemplating suicide. I have a good feeling that tonight might finally be the night to find that peace that I have been desperately looking for. Death by asphyxiation with a belt is how I intend to kill myself. I wish I could go back to Canada but I don't have the financial resources to do that since I have 0 bucks to my name. All I have is this Alienware laptop I bought in Vancouver. Getting a mundane job is too depressing and if I know myself, it won't be before a week I quit the job. The longest work I've ever had was for over a year doing this security gig where I basically had to do nothing but sit in front of live-security footage of a building. I feel like thats the ideal job for me even tho it sucks at pay. I can't do that sorta work here in India since the pay is next to nothing here compared to in Vancouver where at least you can survive on those wages. When I think of the biggest regret of my life ie. coming back here, I feel like I would have failed at life either way since I had nobody back there in Vancouver. (Vancouver sure is a lonely city tbh) I had just one friend over there who was a big help to me. But even there, I was living a pretty lonely job despite doing the security gig. Oh, and the reason I came back was due to visa issues, you know...after failing two times. I could have taken that course for the third time but I don't know what it was but my lack of courage and my laziness made me quit that course and come back to India. Sorry for anyone reading this if it feels like a rambling. Either way, I am on the verge of killing myself with that belt as I write this...Thanks for taking the time and bearing with me to read this long life story of mine.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1554768487.0, "author": "Ravas_wf", "title": "I guess i should post here about this...", "selftext": "Throwaway account that has some mild links to the real me in the name. Just in case someone actually cares enough to try and help meSo yeah, im Pretty sure I have mild depression. I haven't been able to sustain motivation which was the only thing that kept my ADD from being a setback for me. Initaly I perceived my parents weren't the type to understand mental health. At least they didn't believe it'd be any help for me after we moved countries. This was a major issue as after we moved my life fell apart completely. While i was the type of kid who struggled to make friends but would immediately get attached to the one's I could make. Now changing countries with no idea of how to blend in the new environment fucked me upNow 4 years after that move the last of my strained abilities to maintain any figment of my prior self has died. I'm no longer as athletic as I was. I lack most of my prior creative drive. My grades plummet and rise with illogical connections and I've grown about a foot. Basically I no longer reconise my prior self and have become a hollow shell of my past self. And that's the story without all the tragediesInitially a few weeks after moving to the new country my grandmother died from a hear related infliction my family still hasn't told me the full story (even after 3 and 7/12th years) leaving my grandfather in our custody (very important later on) this was already a heavy blow on me and my uncle (my father's brother) who so far was the only other person close to me that I knew had depression. A year later that same uncle was shot and killed in a homicide case, he was leaving the bank and was shot by one or more people (3 years later and my family also hasn't told me the full story) 2 consecutive deaths in the progression of one year after moving countries hasn't been kind on my psyche. Now to the point of my grandfather. He wasn't all that sane of a man before my grandmother died but now he acts more like a rabid animal. Not the best veiw to have of your grandfather but it's true and I have plenty of experiences to explain why. Initally he became more \"suicidal\" in his eating habits, where he ate tones of sugar even though he's a type 1 diabetic. This progressed into him stealing food to horad in his room... After all that my parents realized he might be going insane as he allready was on heavy medication for some prior mental illness (he was a pharmacist in the past and self prescribed alot leading to some braindamage? I don't know the details as usual as my family loves keeping their secrets from the younger generation) this man now has de-evolved to the point where he's past shame and does whatever he likes alongside verbally and physical abusing people. So he's usually kept inside his room through bribery and sometimes baracading. But my father refuses to send him to any medical facility (although they tried to send him to a temple... That ended badly and tarnished our image there. Too bad I'm not religious anyways)Now about the moving of countries. I was shifted from the United States to the shitshow mother nation of mine   ***INDIA*** where the people are shitty and my family here varies from isolated country side hillbillies and well mannered and posh city dwelers. I was the only one from a foreign and suburban environment and counfused as fuck. The people in school where nice originally and some still are but I was really bad at first impressions and kept to myself too much. Now I was lied to originally that I was in the nation for a year to 2 at max but the series of deaths and misfortunes had further propelled us to a point where we wherent sure how long it would last...Now all these fuckups an I sit here with my fucked up brain wondering if I really should overdose on these prescription drugs. Haven't done it yet but every day I edge closer. Never was suicidal but I've been lied to alot about when I'm going to be leaving this forsaken life where I believed everything was temporary and disposable. I lack any personality anymore and all I've got left is some shallow amount of my prior self and a series of unfortunate events and issues trailing me. I've almost resorted to self harm but I couldn't handle the pain and decided to just shed whatever hurt me behind. So please.

It is time for me to DIE. I already had a reddit friend kill himself last month because of racial self hatred just like me. Now I have the motivation to go trough with it as well. I have some nitrogen gas and a plastic bag. Its time.", "selftext": "So Im going to be completely honest here I am probably the biggest self loather you'll ever see. And I am also what many call a shit-skin, and ive been trying and trying relentlessly to bleach and get rid of the stupid brown color but its just not going anywhere, IT KEEPS COMING BACK. I dont know how Michael Jackson did it, but looks like you need alot of money to scrape that much disgusting melanin from your skin and turn white. I am from the dirtiest shit hole country on earth (India), and ive hated it from the moment I was born. See, I grew up in the west, so indian males outside india are the ultimate human punching bags.All the shows, movies, pop culture, and stereotypes have us a weak, pathetic, nerdy losers. My entire life growing up I knew I was fundamentally less pleasing to look at than all my classmates who were white, black, chinese, and mexican. Our genetics are so awful, I believe there can be no god if he cursed us with such awful genes and such a cringe worthy culture. No matter how much you work out, or try to improve, the shitty indian genetics steps in and ruins everything. To add to that, I knew since I was at least 10 years old that there is no way I would ever be able to date any girls when I grew up. Actually ive been on reddit since the very beginning, there might even be my old posts here somewhere from when I was 11 years old in middle school ranting about how when I grow up I will never be able to date any girl because im indian, AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE 100% TRUE. Women fundamentally are repulsed by every single feature we have and I dont even blame them, I know im genetic filth and accept it. Im 22 now, and you know what, before I become a total loser, im just going to end it ESPECIALLY SINCE I ALREADY HAD ANOTHER INDIAN FRIEND OF MINE I WAS TALKING TO ON REDDIT KILL HIMSELF RECENTLY. His user name was \"Skorpz\". He even made the local news, he jumped off his college dorm room and was declared dead at the scene. And thats my motivation, because I already have a reddit friend who actually did it. I got depressed for quite a while after I found out what happened, and it looks like im going to go for it too.This world was designed to be rigged against anyone who looks like me, and our people historically were losers who were slaves to muslims and brits for 800 years and never fought back once. Just knowing in descended from such pathetic people and that I am indian just makes it so I cant even sleep at night anymore. Im done with this. I am stuck in a body that I do not like, and have nothing in common with. But the problem is that I cannot escape it or modify it much. Its like being stuck with a crappy car and not being able to get rid of it. IT SUCKS, and ive decided that I do not plan to live out the rest of my life in this stupid indian body. Ive already self harmed and damaged myself to quite a lot as well. I usually bash myself in the face with a bat whenever I fly into my rages. Usually until my face is swollen and eyes blackened, I'll hit myself until I just cant take anymore and collapse in a little puddle of my own blood. But the sick thing is that, I ENJOY IT, I actually hate myself so much that I enjoy seeing my stupid indian face beaten, swollen and bleeding in the mirror. Its like the greatest gratification ever, so yes, I guess I do qualify as mentally ill at this point, and dont dare say \"get help\" because I already did that, and its a total joke! I like the thought of being dead and no longer having to be indian. I could just be nothing finally. Or even better, be reborn as a non indian person. That would be an ultimate dream! Because im not going to find any happiness in this life and in this indian body, it just isnt going to happen. Especially since all the indian girls also love making fun of us, saying they will never date an indian guy, white worship, saying we are worthless and that they would rather be single forever than be with an indian guy. You know, that shit HURTS. It really hurts more than anyone could imagine when women of your own race say stuff like that. And if you are an indian girl reading this, I hope that you are happy! I know you think of us as worthless, ugly, shit skinned, sub humans who have no feelings and are not good enough for you, but we do feel just as much as yo do, and when you say stuff like that, its enough to break every last bit of confidence and self worth a stupid indian guy like me has. SO I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE! I hope you get your sick gratitude from it, because you've succeeded in getting rid of us one by one by pushing us to death. The media praises indian women as being \"exotic and beautiful\" and oppressed by evil indian guys on the other hand who are the beta nerd worthless gas station workers like Apu. After all indian women have won more beauty pageants than any other country apparently. ITS JUST AWFUL HOW THINGS ARE FOR US! Why does it have to be this way!?!?! I never did anything wrong to hurt anyone, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME??? WHY IS THE WORLD SO HELLBENT ON CRUSHING US AND SPITTING US BACK OUT!Well, with that being said, I guess in a few hours none of that will matter anymore. I'll either be in heaven or hell, or maybe best case scenario reborn as a man of another race, or even better, reborn as an indian woman at least. Worst case scenario im reincarnated AS ANOTHER INDIAN GUY! I'd rather be reborn as a cockroach than be indian all over again I fucking swear! Indian men are treated lower than cockroaches! We are lower than dirt for fucks sake! I hope you all feel satisfied that you've driven someone to the breaking point. Someone who you never even gave a chance all because of his stupid race. I hope you are all happy with what you've done ridiculing an entire group of people and using us as punching bags so much that we just dont even want to live anymore. So goodbye and good riddance! In just a few hours the hands that typed this will be cold and dead, and im alone in India somewhere now, and nobody knows where I am. So I'll leave you with a bit of poetry that really sums up my existence written by Joseph Merrick the most deformed man to ever walk the earth.

I'm a stranger. I'm suicidal. I would just like to share my reasons and my wishes.", "selftext": "Hi. Again.I have been \"pro\" suicide since like six years. I'm 21. Dad died when I was young. I have a lovely awesome stepdad but unfortunately I can only see him at weekends(work).Both my parents are good. They try their best. But you know the generation gap... It's never enough.Also, I got dumped a month or so ago.Reasons:1) My girlfriend was my anchor. I accepted life was difficult, to say the least, but I was willing to be strong as long as I had a family with her.Call me immature... Fine. But if possible, not to my face. I have already heard it.2) Parents. They shouldn't be here... It's not their fault. But, yes, they UNKNOWINGLY did contribute. More communication would've helped.But it's okay. They're human. To err is to be human. I do not blame them.3) Indian society. I get good grades, ok? So people just push more and more... Cuz \"abcdef32\" has so much potential.It's fine when I can handle it. But I've shown that I like other stuff too!! But, the push is mostly still towards studies.Like, if  I'm working on a college magazine + a club + some college computer Extracurricular stuff that professors personally asked me to do after college...I'm still expected to score the same.But if it was someone else, eh... They just need to pass. It's unfair. I get it, don't get me wrong. I know the \"potential\" thing. I DID get the grades.But I have my limits and I did tell them. But nope.So, college professors and my colleagues... Just the society in general.3a) Girlfriend's parents. They were a major reason for the breakup. They knew about us for five years but still didn't say a word and when it was time to graduate, they just broke us up. Why? Cuz I eat McDonald's chicken burger.LITERALLY that's the reason. India.4) My own head.I have OCD. Or at least my psychologist said I had it a few years ago and I still think I do. I don't know. Again, please don't judge.I think a lot. Too much. That's the MAIN reason I'm here. Too much thinking. Too little acting.5) Media and internetThis could be 4a but fuck it... Vikings, GoT, Stranger Things... Even shows like friends and HIMYM... They make me depressed. OBVIOUSLY, it's not same for everyone. It's my perception of the shows.My \"sensitivity\". And that would have been fine had I had a goal in life. But no. I have no direction.Same for internet... I get so sad sometimes. Just watching LinusTechTips made me depressed. Wow.6) People taunting/judging meAgain, could be 4b... But no, some things deserve their own category.All my life, I've been called a topper. People come to me when they need help for their studies and then they leave. On a normal day, I'm kind of no one, to everyone.They judged my depression. You too... Reddit. I've been told that I'm not depressed. Just... \"Mild\".Only once has a real doctor said I had depression. And that too, \"mild\". Whilst another psychiatrist said I was irrational... Comparing my mental thoughts to a person who needed kidney transplant. Like wtf.Everyone has their issues. Just cuz you're(generalizing) worse off doesn't mean that I can't be in a similar position for different reasons!!7) Dead dadI was six. Traumatizing. More so cuz no one involved me in the funeral rites and later on too... It's like his image was just buried by my mom and my brother.He worked very hard for his job. He wanted to help people. And he passed that thought onto me and that brings me to number 8.8) My previous dreamI want to help people. Wanted to. Want to. I don't know.I wanted... That people who were depressed... I could understand them. Especially teenagers. Try and help. Just show them that what they're feeling is not \"inhuman\"... \"Irrational\"... That they're not alone. That someone else has gone through it.But I didn't take that field. Fine. I still wanted to help. Be it tiny things like helping those college students..Just help. But, as time went on, I see... Life is such a shitty playground. My dad took his work home with him... The stress was a lot. And I'm the same. Stress + OCD is a lot for me, at least.I cannot help. Even if I want to. If I do help, I'll just kill myself... Slowly. Cuz that's what the stress does. Slow suicide.9) Future careerI wanna move. US or Canada. I don't know what I'll do. I heard it's very competitive.I cannot handle a single entrance exam of fucking India... How am I supposed to handle USA's exams? USA's students? I can't... I'll fucking be an idiot. Good grades≠≠≠≠good skills.I can't talk to people my own age.I can't talk on phone.I can't even order food.I don't think I have any scope whatsoever. Be it psychology or my current profession...10) PharmacyYeah, I'm in pharmacy. It's good.Or at least, it was. I thought I'd get to help people. But no, it's sitting behind a desk taking meds off the shelf and dispensing... Mostly.Helping is a tiny part. Teeny tiny. 1%.I hate it now. I loved it in the beginning when it was all... Introductory. But as years go by, you realise the actual jobs available and you see that they all are basically desk jobs. Some being industrial... And no, I don't call making meds or discovering new drugs \"helping\".At least, not MY helping. I want to help a HUMAN directly. It is helping sure... Working in industry is helping. But just, not how I want to.11) SexI love anal. I love BDSM. Submission and domination. As a male, I love being fucked.Gay. Bisexual.I love boobs. I love girls. But can't cum during sex. Would like to suck a dick. Try it, at least.Gay?I love a clean vagina. Bi?I don't know. Again, Indian here... People at the age of 20... They were fucking booing our government for legalizing gays. And these are SMART well mannered, well raised people.I don't care for their opinion as much... But I do care cuz it doesn't allow me to express. If I talk, it's pointless. That's all.12) HealthI have epilepsy. I had depression. Or have. I had/have OCD.Constantly suicidal. Anxiety.My stomach and intestines feel like years of fast food have rotten them. As a pharmacist, I should be smarter... But no, I keep eating junk.My penis burns sometimes after I cum and I need to pee together.Lots of needs to pee. Basically, both holes are malfunctioning.My legs hurt. Joints hurt. Mom has arthritis. Grandma had joint issues. It could pass.I know it may look like I'm a hypochondriac but a)I doubt anyone is still reading and b) I'm just assuming and lastly c) I'm a fucking human and I'm fucking scared so cut me some slack.I'm not making some definitive statement. Just... My health has always had issues. Right eye is bad.Also I have keloids on the back. And one small one on the nose.So again, overall it FEELS like a slow suicide.13) Nope. This isn't 13 Reasons why. 12 is the last one.To conclude, suicide is never a result of ONE singular thing. It's always a multiple of things. That's what I believe.So take any reason. Say no. 5... I don't even remember what it was. But take that alone and nope, that's not why I'm killing myself by jumping. It's 1+2+...+12. It's all TOGETHER that I have given up.Eh. Those are the reasons. Do you want the wishes? I bet not... Who has even read this far?***If anyone has... List of wishes is shorter... \"Reasons to live\", eh?These are mine. But they apply to you too if you're living. If you want to make me happy after my death... You can help me by doing this. But... Otherwise, it's just a list of my reasons to live.1) Movies and TV ShowsPlease watch Avengers: Endgame. Vikings final season. GoT final season.Won't force anyone to watch 13 Reasons... If you can watch it till it ends... Good but you don't have to.2) GamesPlay Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. Enjoy it. And once in a while, just sit in the car and watch the sun set.3) SexFigure out the lines between gay, bi and straight.And above all, enjoy sex.4) The OneGet that girl back. Or find that girl. And hold on tight, and never let go.5) FamilyImprove communications, if you have the strength which I never did.6) FoodTaste some beef, bacon... Spaghetti, pizzas other than Domino's, some burgers NOT in McDonald's... And let me know.Cuz all that stuff is unavailable in my city.7) Idiot.Try drugs once. No injections.Try smoking once.Try all drinks once.Try it all... Once. Otherwise, why live?Again, for me, those things are unachievable tonight.8) TechnologyLet me know when VR+ AR(MR) is consumer feasible for Skyrim and Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk.Let me know when phones become good again.Let me know when tech becomes affordable in India(maybe that's reason no. 13 to die...)I think that's it.***Conclusion...I was going to die today. But I didn't want to face my dad and my brother. Maybe tomorrow when I have an exam where for the first time in my life, I haven't read a single word.Look, I'm not faking. Today, tomorrow. Hopefully never!! BUT... I don't see the chance.And the mods said the 3 days rule, right??? That wait for 3 days?? Well, I've waited. I've been thinking and preparing for more than a week now. And that's just the \"active\" part.It has been in my head since six years. So please don't fucking play with me by saying \"wait for a year, you're young\".At 30, you're young. 40 is older. Why die?At 25, you're young. At 60 too you're fucking young.I'm 21. I know I am young. But I also trust my instincts. Above all the people in the world, I would know me the most, no??***Look, just, conclusion 2:I MIGHT die soon. I've written all my notes and said almost all my goodbyes.Except for you. Reddit. So this is me, saying goodbye and goodnight.I hope... I hope I post on reddit after a week and a month and a year. I don't particularly wish to die. But, I do \"love\" to stop life. I do think I'm too weak to continue.And look, if it's any comfort to you... I read on the internet or some doctor told me... The people who talk most about suicide never do it. So maybe I'm just one of those fakers, yeah?Sigh... I know. I know it's not faking. But those doctors... Licensed registered psychiatrists... They told me this at such a fucking age where puberty is ending and \"adulthood\" is beginning when the cement was settling. It just got in and I can never get it out. (Reason no.6)As for YOU... I hope your 2019 is better. If I can help you in any way... I will try. But I doubt I have the energy. Look, man... Or woman... Thanks for reading. Even if you only read the ending.If I don't post... Just... Reddit is included in reason no.5. BUT, still...

My job sucks, it's something they (a managed services company) moved me to when the company I was hired to do much higher level support for ended their contract with my company to relocate support to India back last spring, so they moved me to this role so as not to lose me, but it's way way beneath me, stuff I was doing 15+ years ago and had moved way past in my career. I've had 5 bosses in the time I've been there and the new one absolutely hates me for some reason and micromanages me to death, harping on things like being 2 minutes late from my 30-minute allowed lunch, and ignoring the fact that I kick ass on calls, we're handling 70% of the calls vs. the Indian helpdesk counterpart when all we're required to do it 51% and I constantly get accolade emails from customers to the bosses, but never hear a peep about that, or staying 40 minutes late on a call or anything, just stuff like being 2 minutes late coming back from lunch.&amp;#x200B;Add to this I used to find meaning in my life from making music and being creative and such but I've lost basically all drive to do this anymore. All I do is sleep and go to work and basically hate the vast majority of my awake existence. I feel no purpose anymore whatsoever and the only reason I don't kill myself is what it would do to my wife (together 22 years now) and dog who I love very much.&amp;#x200B;I want to get my life together but I just see like no hope. I tried getting on subs months ago but even after 24 hours they made me immediately go into accute withdrawl which is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I'd rather die than experience that again (ended up scoring dope to make it stop).

I got into thinking what could the reason be. Then I don't know how I stumbled into this Black-Pill stuff,I watched FaceAndLMS's video on YT,got horribly depressed. My confidence took a huge hit, to the point where it's non-existent now. I have most other things in life in order. I have my own business, I am self-dependent since age 16. Now since I have stumbled into all this stuff, I don't have any more ambition. I just want to die ASAP. Life seems hopeless. No matter whats possible for me to do , it seems like it all comes down to genetics and being good looking. I didn't buy all this in the begining but it started to make more sense. I looked up stats of online dating, especially stuff like response rate by race and got more discouraged. Got over it for a few days, then met a girl again.Went on a date with her.Everything went well. After going on the second date she was like 'I just like korean guys and white guys, sorry'. I accepted that I'm always going to be single after that but the things that concerns me the most are how it's gonna affect my career. I read up more Black Pilled stats and found out that being succesful has a lot to do with your appearance too. You can get away with a lot more, get more favours etc. I don't know if it's just the wormhole effect but now all the BP stuff seems real and if i come up with anything to reason against that, it just seems like I'm denying reality.It may sound stupid and might seem like I'm a whiny little teenager who cries about everything but believe me it's not.I've faced hardships in life.I've had been working hard since I was 13,can say that I wasted my childhood, avoided wasting time, haven't watched TV/Movies/ or any other stuff people do to enjoy so that I could focus on creating the life I always wanted to live but you can't cheat Biology.I can fix every other thing like Money ,Status but as far as the stuff I've seen now ,I'm fixated on the viewpoint that looks are everything in life. I searched up on people like Jeremy Meeks,he was a felon,never did shit in his life, but just because of his looks, had women raise a campaign to pay for his bail, got donations from them, became a millionaire ,cheated on his wife, had the daughter of a billionaire fall in love with him,got married and is still admired by women. So why even try when it's all about genetics :(.You can still look up on his instagram and find out that women are drooling over him.

I am basically fed up from this world which obviously has been so cruel so far, there are good people off-course but I am finding it hard to be in company of those.

But, I decided to do it all, preparing for IELTS, next month have an exam of that, don't really know if I will be able to crack it or not. Still having lot's and lot's of doubts in my mind, weather I will be able to get a job there or not, even the smallest job possible. I am currently working as a web developer but due to moving in different country and without having their education degree, I understand I will not get my ideal job easily. Now, I am fine with even cleaning dishes in restaurants absolutely no issue related to ego.But the problem is , I am suffering from stammering so quite not sure will I get some basic job there or not which will not require speaking, and will the employer hire a stammerer or not :(Overall, It's all messed up, I really don't know what will I do next, as my stammering is always there to push my mind in a negative side that I won't be able to achieve anything in life. Plus girlfriend want to merry next year itself, I am not making much to feed her and obviously after going there I don't know what will I make, I am getting mentally harassed by her on daily basis now when you will merry and this is creating hell of load in my mind.

Obviously I am not considering suicide but these thoughts have started coming recently and am afraid my life will keep on being messy.

Here goes my story -I am a guy in mid-20s in India of a typical middle class family. I have always been overly emotional and a chronic overthinker which has abated significantly in recent years. Perhaps due to my upbringing or nature, I am not a very chilled out person who would love to play games or do anything which most other people do. Most of the time, I am immersed in my current goal be it of office or personal goal. For example, I was trying to get fit sometime back and I did it by focusing completely on it. Completing my goals has never been an issue for me.However, my problem is with people. Due to being shy and introverted, I have few friends and those are not emotionally close to me. That does not mean that I won’t be called for hanging out or if I visit them then they won’t meet me. In fact, I have travelled much with these people. But the issue is with emotional connection with them. They would never share any personal details with me. Probably a few laughs here and there but the emotional part is very less.I see my friends respecting others and wanting to hang out with them but with me they are reticent. That might be because of difference in personalities. There was also a very close female friend of mine for whom I cared a lot and even care a lot now. But I never got the same respect and affection as she had for others in her life. She does consider me a very good friend but only until more extroverted people come along and outshine me.I am pretty depressed and suicidal for some time now. I don’t know how to become extroverted or chilled out in life. I even went to a therapist but it was of no use.

I have very few friends and go to college where people are friendly but not close friends . I have been in a weird mindset lately because I’ve lived with my mum and dad . It started out really great but then they stopped talking to me . We stopped making good conversation and they started complaining like stereotypical old people . At one point my dad didn’t put up a canvas picture and my mum said they should see other people . A ridiculous and hilarious situation . Also I realised that while everyone else was making money and spending time with friends I was still only working four hours a week which was nothing in comparison to the 20 hours a week I would’ve or could’ve worked . No one seems to care that I could of been so much more financially independent . I have been in a ridiculous situation . Whenever I was with my family we did boring slow paced activities that my parents wanted to do such as take long walks . As a young 18 year old it would have been better if I did more lively things . But obviously I don’t have the friends for that . I have had a three month summer holiday but all I could focus on was my painful haemorrhoids which cause anal bleeding and pain and itchiness and burning sensations just because . 😑 Good news is they’re not severe or life threatening just really painful 😑🙃🙃. I am aware I’m in a ridiculous situation wherein I didn’t do any normal teenager / young adult things apart from study and get decent ish grades . But everyone got those grades and got jobs and / started driving and /or entered relationships etc . Also I’m autistic and apparently this can make it harder to form relationships . Overall I’m so done with life , or the lack there of that I’ve been experiencing . I feel betrayed and as an 18 year old adult feel the right that as someone who experiences on and off anal pain ( which the doctor basically said was more so a result of stress than a physical problem when I got them checked when I was 16) and feel like I have a right to die . I either want an amazing life or no life at all . I refuse to be the subject of shitty circumstances or pity or sadness . My family have sat back and let me be a social recluse for three months even though they said I was depressed . All my mum ever does it chat shit about all the racist shit and all the horrific surgeries she’s had growing up in Kenya and India . She is so fucking depressed I get it from her . Everyone else is in this amazing headspace because they are financially independent and have friends and have spent the three month summer holiday having fun which they have shown on snapchat . But obviously they don’t care about me and wouldn’t help if I told them the situation . Furthermore in our first year of college we had very little work . I still didn’t apply for a job or anything even though most of my first year was free time . I think I was depressed before or something maybe . I feel sad I could’ve spent the summer building muscle and not just binging on junk food . I violated my vegan principles by binging on non vegan junk food in my room. I have gained weight and my parents just say or do nothing . Even before I was 18. And my college friends aren’t close enough to me even though we literally did so much to help each other . When one of their sisters were dying we all stopped studying and talked with her . She also has a girlfriend who she met at the beginning of the year . They spent everyday of their lives together for like5 months straight . She knows her family and vice versa . They have become so close and their lives have become so intertwined it’s frustrating to see a relationship flourish in front of you while some days you can’t even walk properly because of the haemorrhoid pain and because you barely have any friends . It’s funny because I could’ve had a better experience but I strongly believe my family’s lack of help or guidance , predisposed genes to feel depressed , a juxtaposition between my experience and other people’s experiences etc has made me so done. I don’t even have a self esteem anymore. I don’t even go to college anymore .  I don’t want to live half the life I could’ve led if I did work out and looked better , or if I got a job earlier and had more money . Even if I continue to live life it’ll be a socially undesirable life because I’m a little chubby and live with my parents . Everyone even now comments on the way I look and the situation I’m in . A lot of my relatives I feel belittle me and my parents definitely don’t take my situation seriously . Other families actually work together but my family is so individually focused . Even on Christmas we just do our own things . I just don’t want to live the life I would live if I do work hard and don’t give up.

I watch tv shows or yt videos all day while getting no real enjoyment from it. I have a lot of stuff and work to do but still I waste my time doing this. I guess I don't like confronting the issue so I just beat around the bush  &gt;  &gt;I haven't found real joy doing anything or I haven't liked doing anything since a year or twoMy relationship with my parent's isn't the same anymore. We always had a very guarded relationship where I did not try sharing anything negative with them because it would always end up making myself feel shittier about myself. I have been thinking of killing myself everyday for at least a month and I. I looked online and people said I should open to my parents about it. It completely back-fired. They started saying I am good for nothing and won't be capable of doing anything. My parents basically echoed the thoughts I had been having in my head. My dad told me why can't I be normal like other kids. Why can't I go to school enjoy it, talk to other kids, get good grades, pursue hobbies, play sports. Now I am really serious about killing myself because now I have no one to talk to or fall back to. I have friends but I know none of them are real and good friends. I try to talk to them about this and they just say \"why can't I be happy and normal\". I live in India so any awareness about mental-health is non-existent. My dad refuses to take me to a therapist and I don't know what to do anymore.

I failed twice, and am now only eligible for a new non-engineering and a local college with no countrywide recognition, no job prospects . And I didn't fair well into other exams either. I did as much as I could do, but it wasn't enough. It always look liked fighting a losing battle. I do not have much options in my hand. I have developed a dislike for engineering and I can't get on board doing it now. I want to pursue non-technical fields like law, business administration and journalism, and to pursue I can give their entrances next year which would mean spending another year in home, considering I fell just short of clearing their entrances. Another thing with that is if you have difference of two years between your school and under graduation, you are overlooked for college placements, and any promising job in general. The society isn't kind to you at all if you are 18 and have no college. I have let my parents down massively, twice. I can't afford to do it once again. I feel miserable for letting them down and dashing their hopes, time and time again.  My mother feels that my life is looking more and more destined to not be great, unlike kids she teaches and kids of her colleague, who all made it to good colleges. She avoids talking to anybody about me, because it will be embarrassing.It really hurts me. Sometimes I can't sleep enough or sometimes I sleep a lot.

All they say is \"go ahead\" and that their lives will be better without me. They've even said that they regret not throwing me out on the streets when I was younger.I really feel like my friends and teachers are much better than my parents, and they are a lot more supportive too. During FBLA this year, I didn't place at States, and my friends said things like \"there's always next year\" and \"you'll do better next time\". When my parents found out, they called me a worthless piece of shit and told me to get out of the house.Now, they are trying to make me quit band, even though that's probably the only time I get to have fun and not worry about anything. Whenever I tell them things such as my friends' parents are much better than them, or my teachers are way more nice, they say why don't you go live with them. They also beat me for getting mad. They push me completely past the breaking point and when I act out even a tiny bit they lose their shit. They lie to their extended family that \"I'm a danger to them\" or \"I have anger issues\". Whenever I'm alone with them they constantly berate me. Everyday when my dad drives me to school he won't shut the fuck up about how much he hates me. My mom has no patience at all and when I don't do what she wants right away, she hits me with whatever she can find. My dad has tried to choke me multiple times, and whenever I push him away they make a big deal about it. They always talk about how I should be cultured and have respect. I just want to say to them that Indian culture is a piece of shit. They have forced me to hate my heritage. I wish that I wasn't Indian. I fucking hate all the cultural bullshit they force me to do. I've threatened to call the police or something similar and they always hit me and say that I'm an ungrateful person. Since 8th grade I really don't want to live with them. I am usually really good at hiding my emotions at school and to this day, I haven't told anyone about what goes on at home. I am sure that they don't treat me the same as all of my friends get treated by their parents. They've pushed me to the edge so much that I constantly feel like I have no will to live.

In my first year, after 3 months I was put in a \"toppers only class\" kind of thing. That is when it all went downhill, I couldn't cope up, I lost interest and pretty much flunked my first year. I was shifted to the normal class for the 2nd year and I again started performing good. There were ups and downs but it was satisfactory to say the least.&amp;nbsp;Then it was around Jan'2018 when the classes stopped so everyone was doing self\\-study for the next 3\\-4 months.

My mum, goes to work so I was o=pretty much alone at home for near about 12 hours and could not study anything even when I tried to. It got to the point that I invited my grandparents so there would be someone at home to monitor me but I just couldn't study.&amp;nbsp;My mum was pretty supporting and used to tell me not to get tensed and that if everything goes bad she would get me a seat in her companies University \\(The company she works for is in the education industry\\). I somehow studied for the last month and was feeling okayish about this exam. &amp;nbsp;Then the exam came and it wasn't good, but I expected I would qualify for the main exam and kind of knew I wouldn't be getting a good college that were given based on the scores of this exam. My mum, checked my paper that night, despite both of us agreeing that we would wait for the results. I then gave an examination for a private university 4 days later which is kinda easier than the other paper. 10 days after that I gave 2 more entrance exams which were okayish but I was never gonna go to those 2.&amp;nbsp;The results came for the first private exam and I did bad \\(got 20k rank out of 200,000\\) then  the \\(JEE\\) results came and I absolutely shit the bed.

I just feel like my whole life, things have just built on top of each other. I don't even think a single therapist has heard all of the shit I think about. I feel like everything in my life haunts me. And nobody takes it seriously because I need to hit rock bottom first. I don't seem like I need help because I have gotten okay at covering it up. But people around me know I feel this way. It just seems like I am not broken enough for help. But I am. I grew up in a family of four. My parents are immigrants. I have an older brother. He has severe autism and I think my dad expects me to take care of him after they are gone. I can barely take care of myself and I want to move out of the area which I could not with my brother. I don't know how I would hold down a job yet pay someone to take care of him and take care of myself. It means the rest of my life would be dedicated to my brother, not me. I couldn't get married. I am already scared to have kids in case they are autistic. The cultural gap in my family is hard. My mom struggling with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression while insisting on no treatment meant hell for my childhood. 7 year old me spilling a glass of milk meant I got screamed at for the rest of the day. Banshee screaming about how I am a waste of space, stupid, worthless, etc. This goes on for hours in stages. If you say anything, it starts again. My mom has threatened my dad with a knife. She refuses to take any medication. In one of her episodes, she took me and my autistic brother to a homeless shelter because she was convinced my dad was evil. My dad said he went after her as soon as he could but I think part of him wanted to just leave us there. I always prayed for the day my parents would get divorced. They were toxic for each other. My dad has severe anger issues. It just worsened throughout the course of my life. One time, he went to visit his family in India. I was seven and my mom was getting incredibly upset. She broke off a drawer in the kitchen and threatened to hit me with it, nudging it on my shoulder. I called 911 crying. The police officers came. My mom acted somewhat normal but said I was misbehaving. The drawer was on the ground, broken off. They said it was my fault because I misbehaved. They asked if my severely autistic brother was okay. And in that decision I made a choice. Because I heard what happens to people like my brother in the system. And my parents had money. She didn't hurt my brother but I realized that what my brother could potentially go through much worse in the governmental system. They asked if I had anywhere else to stay. I said no. They told me to go upstairs and lock myself there and gave me their number in case she did it again. I called my dad. All he said was \"did it work? Can we try that next time she is upset?\" Never asked if I was okay. I spent that weekend in fear. Just glares, snotty whispers, etc. Whenever I received less than an A, my mom would ignore me. After two days, she would start screaming. That would be a sigh of relief because it meant she would love me again by the end of the week. If she didn't, I was more worried. There were weekly arguments in my house between my parents. They would tell me to go upstairs and ignore them but I would foolishly ask them to stop. They did not care. They only cared about screaming at each other. My dad hates my mom but still cares about her. She had an abusive childhood and the alternative to her staying in our lives would be to be in a mental institution with stigma because she would be a divorced woman according to Indian society even though we live in America. My brother's autism means he can't say I love you. He wouldn't even know if I died. He has so many violent tantrums. He just hits himself repeatedly. He screams like a toddler except he's much much older. There have been so many nights in my life where I didn't sleep. All my grandparents passed away by the time I was 18 and a family friend. Those losses hit me hard. I've had anxiety for most of my life. I rarely socialized with people because my parents did not have time with me because of my brother. I was a freak. I got depression in 10th grade. My perfect record as a student was gone after that and I lost all motivation. My family in India thinks of my family as a black sheep so they all dislike me because I suffer from mental illness along with our family. They judge us but they haven't had to deal with mental illness. I mean who are they to judge. We went to India to see them, me and my father, and my uncle drunkenly said no one wanted you guys here but I convinced them to let you come. I've never felt so embarrassed in my life. We still had another week we were with them. My friend got raped when she was in college. I think she might hate me secretly. She had a girl she knew come over and they both got drunk. The other girl started puking and my friend started panicking. I told her to call two people she knew there. They didn't pick up and she said she was going to ask her neighbor across the hall for help. I didn't think twice and I said sure if you know him and you think he will help. She started calling me the next morning but I was tired of talking to her while she was drunk. She told me the next morning that she was raped by him. I've felt like scum ever since. Because I should have told her not to go. And my father had open heart surgery my senior year of high school. Just when I thought things would be going okay, I had to become an adult. I was depressed. Isolated. Barely any family came to help and I was seventeen. My uncle in the US came once a week to check in but no one was at the house full time. My mom was convinced my dad was faking and refused to help me or take responsibility. I started grocery shopping, driving my autistic brother to doctor's appointments, visiting my father at the hospital or wherever he was, I went to my part time job, and I started missing school. I would go in the morning, leave, and come back at the end of the day so it wouldn't count as an absence but an early dismissal. The attendance ladies knew me by name. My schoolwork started piling up. I couldn't see my friends because I had to be on call for my father or stay at the house for my mentally ill mother and brother. My dad had angry outbursts in public all the time but I was the one cleaning up the mess after him, convincing them he was harmless instead of a psycho. We also argue a lot. He tries to control me. He acts like he doesn't but he is slightly misyogynist. And he is unbelievably full of himself and at times displays little sympathy. He got so annoyed at me once while he was driving he hit me in the mouth while I had braces. It started bleeding so I screamed at him to take me to an ER because I was scared. He started arguing with me another day and I accidentally hit him between his eyes with a phone because I was trying to defend myself. I felt guilty hurting him and felt awful. I was just scared. I think I became sort of a monster. I started screaming and getting upset all the time. I would threaten violence or get very physical because I felt it was the only way to survive. On the day of my graduation, my dad and mom started screaming so I left for graduation in tears. My dad went because my friend's dad offered to drive him. He left halfway through and I waited half an hour afterwards to see if he would show up to congragulate me. He ended up going to dinner with the other dad and asked if I wanted to join him. All those empty promises from multiple family members saying earlier in my life that they would come stung. I ended up going to a school I wasn't going to go to because my dad thought it was more prestigious and it was closeish to home that I would be able to check up on the family. I hate it here. And I was so depressed and going home my first year, I failed to make friends. I am so lonely. And my dad said I could leave but then lied and said he didn't mean it so here I am in year 2. Still barely talk to anyone. My life should have been getting better, not getting worse. Now I can barely take showers. I don't have any motivation. I wasted two years of my life. My aunt and uncle live near me but they only talk when they need something. I have a car on campus. So they ask if I am going home one weekend to pick up some things. Or if could drive them to Walmart. Or if I can help them move. They left so late from their old apartment they slept in my dorm room so they wouldn't sleep in the lobby because I offered. But I know what they think of me. Because they never call otherwise. They claim it's because they do not want to disturb me but they know I don't have any friends. They told the people they were staying with that I wasn't their niece but I was a student driving them. I waited for an hr in the car eating fast food while they were packing up because I was only a student. I never even meet the people they are staying with. I sleep in a pile of trash everyday on my bed. Sometimes I don't sleep. Sometimes I sleep the whole day. Sometimes I miss all my classes. I wanted a sense of normalcy and instead I got this. I told 3 of my friends that I felt hopeless. But none of them take me seriously. I had one therapist tell me that I probably will not commit suicide so why bother talking about it. I told another at college but she said I am resistant to change and in that moment she was my last hope. I almost bought charcoal to kill myself but instead I cried the whole day and missed my classes instead. I am tired of keeping up this fake happy facade. I was only doing it for my brother. But it's getting too much now. I am doing all of the things you are supposed to do but it never seems like enough.

When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I regret not talking to her, it still haunts me. since the school was big, there was no memorial, and only her closest friends gave a shit. Even though I didn't know her, it killed me seeing her friends and parents so broken. i knew that I killed her, I could've talked to her, comforted her, even saved her life. After, I looked online and volunteered at a call center. It was horrible. We got almost no training, numerous prank calls, and the first person that I really talked to killed herself. Her name was Mary. She was raped and felt so ugly and broken. i gave it my all, but in the end she died. It really messed me up, I still think about it. but where i failed one, I \"saved\" a dozen more. I started on Reddit about less than a week ago and has been a roller coaster of a ride. I've met many different friends from all over the world from India to  Phoenix, AZ. They vary from race,age,religion, and class; but all share something together. see, what I've found is that most callers are not actually suicidal, their lonely, and lonely people have lonely thoughts. To those that were really suicidal, or in the process of killing themselves, I've learned that you can't really do anything except give them a friend in their final moments. And I have. this job is draining, but i love it. i love helping people. There are people and babies walking around today because of me, and they don't even know my name. that's the best part of it. The guy that talked to you in your darkest moment probably passed by you in the street today. Last night i spoke to my final call. She's a manic bipolar with a rough history. I didn't mean to contact her, but while tying up loose ends with the account I accidentally messaged her and she invited me into a chat. We talked for hours, about tv,movies,and video games. it was fun. It turned south though when she started talking about fucked her life was and about how she wanted to kill herself and was going to. after a while she stopped messaging me. I couldn't sleep. I sat by the computer all night long messaging her and shaking. time went by so slow, then a message popped up. I'll copy it from the text=   11:05 PM I’m going to the hospital. Hopefully they will help me. Thank you for talking to me today, you kept me here. I hope you’re doing okay too.= I'm happy. I cried tears of joy. I'm taking a break from this from for a while. but I'll be back. Just remember that the person that you talk to is real, and not just some robot.

Never really taught discipline from my hoarder mom who talked on the phone all day and didn’t give me any attention last basic needs really.I have a couple of memories but they’re at least a decade old at this point... a decade of neglect.

Keep in mind both these people are priests. Again grandpa did nothing wrong he just says it to hurt my mom.Absolutely no love in the relationship literally pure hate. Dad currently is slowly dying of kidney disease(not fast enough) fucking gave it to me and my sister. Honestly had a couple opportunities to kill him and make it seem like an accident but pussied out. Regret it now though. About me... piece of shit that just played computer games all day. Only graduated high school(1.9 gpa summer school every semester+ online classes, failed roughly half my classes every year) cuz teacher took pity on me but didn’t care enough to get me real help. Rest just didn’t like me. Couple of them really hated me. Slept in some classes since I couldn’t sleep at home due to parents fighting and me crying/anxious all night. Probably passed so the numbers looked good on their record. Better to have a 100% pass record one way or the other.Have failed in classes since 2nd grade when I moved to the US. Not dumb just lazy and unmotivated. By junior high hated school due to bullying. Video games and books the only escape. No one wanted to be friends with me till 9th grade.  I did have some friends but lost them since I was too needy. Got no attention at home so overcompensated and weirded them out. I would say there are like 3 people i have  considered true friends. No contact with them now.9th prolly start of my depression. Started community college. Did my work for a bit and then didn’t show up to any finals failed out 1st sem. Academic probation prevented me from easily signing up again so ended up not signing up at all. Didn’t tell my parents. After probation lifted didn’t sign up again and didn’t tell my parents. They found out eventually.Leads to me being sent to India to work IT since my dad knows a religious ceo of a company. Jobs not bad people are fine.Living with aunt/uncle they were super nice and understanding, encouraged me to open up. Told them my life. They relayed it back to my dad and mom who both vehemently refused and lied. Auntand uncle know about my parents shit relationship and fighting constantly and have known since start of marriage. Uncle actually originally set up marriage.Religious reasons divorce not possible for them apparently.My parents told them that I shouldn’t be able to access internet and have to have a ton of extra activities and do part time college. On top of 70 hour work week from monday-Saturday which I was actually doing fairly well. Just was lazy on 3 sundays(3 weeks). Now suddenly got the news that I have to move out in 4 days on my own. Had a panic attack, they called me a crazy retard and made fun of me during it. I yelled and broke my glasses. They just ignored me. They don’t fucking care. I showed up late to work 2-3 times. Boss just says keep your personal shit out. “Why are you so lazy?”Dad probably talked to boss.I should’ve fucking known.. my life is shit. It makes sense. They gave me hope and fucking crushed it.

Now, let's cut to the chase.I am 17 years old, male, living in india and in the final year of my school (12th). I first went to my school counsellor in the beginning of 2015. Then after 4 visits over the year she told me i should see a psychologist/chiatrist. I was depressed. Still am. I didn't have the gall to tell it to my parents directly because i knew they'd not understand, get angry, give very general advice (which i hate) and make it difficult for me to make a visit. So i took the counsellor's help to break the news, first to my mum and then eventually to my dad and elder brother. * she was upset, still thinks that she failed in upbringing me and they all obviously gave general advice* i eventually went to a psychologist and a chiatrist, stopped going to the chologist after 8 months, still go to the chiatrist* the only one i share with the most is my brother, he is far, far more understanding than my parents and while his advice is less general and more personal in nature (which is better) he still lacks the understanding of the disorder which i look for (he is 9 years older than me and lives in Canada for 4+ years now)* i too wish to move abroad, always have, even dreamt about when i was just 12/13 years old, way before my brother even thought of moving. I absolutely fucking hate it here. * Not wanting to boast or come of as special (i am just like you), i am much, much more different than the people around me. In my tastes, preferences, mode of expression, language, more articulate, thoughts, understanding, beliefs and interests. Very few i have come across that are similar. * since i was a kid i was (i now realise and think) raised on the input of others' belief that i was special, gifted and intelligent. Now I think that it fucked me up for later in life. I was sent to a tuition when i was just 5. Just 5! I now detest this fact. However, i was naive and followed. As you may guess, my childhood didn't consist of play outside. But rather studying and play inside. Sheltered. * it was easy to maintain and live up to their illusion of being gifted till 8/9th grade. Just 1.5 hrs of study at the tuition and i was free for the rest of the day. Then i started realising that I wanted more of life and less of studying. That's obviously not what my parents want. * their prime concern is my education (read:schooling), i hate schooling. As said above, my ideas on education are also starkly different, as are my friends'. They (my mum) have went as far as saying (implying) that as long as i study it doesn't matter what else i do. * due to recent events i am writing even this under the guise of studying. Bad as it may sound, luckily less educated parents are easier to fool.Now, on to the recent events. My class 10th result was saved because of my school's interference (as always) with the students' results. My class 11th result was therefore obviously a disaster. Class 12th you may now imagine how it could be going.For the last 10+ days (of vacation) i have done nothing but indulged in escape (which has skyrocketed). I watch movies, play video games and sleep (luckily i am able to carry out other basic tasks as well, unlike other, more suffering people). This upset my mother once more and then this Friday, this is what went down:Night. Watching anime. Haven't studied the entire day. Mum enters the room, angry, upset. **violent**. Asks me to shut down the computer. I comply. Goes on a anger spree of shouting at me, questioning me on my behaviour. I don't answer. I don't want to. I don't trust them. I absolutely detest them. **i maintain silence**. She starts getting violent. Hits me. Hard. On the face, almost near the eyes. Luckily had took off glasses. I don't cry (i haven't for the last 4 years), i feel unable to, at best i can laugh (i didn't do that in front of her). So, she hits me. No scars, no bruises, no marks. Just a slightly swollen face. I still maintain silence for the most part. Not giving in. She then proceeds to leave, go out and cry in front of her god. I didn't go out till she started wailing. Then as any sensible human would do, i went out with tissues and a glass of water. She didn't accept. I made an apology i didn't feel and that's when dad arrived from work. She wouldn't even let me offer him water! Said i don't need to do any more work. That i should just look after myself, all my needs will be taken care of and that i had always been my own master. **i still didn't care**. Then dad wanted me to come sit with him. I told him to have dinner and then I'd come out. I did, explained to him in the most barebone terms what had happened and went to bed after about an hour. ------------------------------------------------I think to myself, what if i was disowned. What'd i do? How'd i act and prepare for it? I make a mental plan and imagination. Would i like it? I try to make it as realistic as possible.Meanwhile i am thinking of suicide. Like last night and today morning. Then Saturday morning i wake up, bathe and get a new med with the help of my chiatrist. Mood improves and falls back by night.I half-assedly study. Mum gives me more of advice that i hate. She says that i can tell her if i don't like it. I don't, but i refrain from saying anything because... well, she'll just get angry.------------------------------------------------Now i am here. With a plan in my mind to give my tuition tests, come back home, gulp a couple of aspirins, take a warm water bath (in my clothes), and make vertical cuts down my arms and a horizontal slit across my neck and **end my life**. This subreddit is an attempt to get by another day. Thank you for your help. I love you all and hope that you can overcome your demons.If I survive, I'll at least be able to play some new video games, live another day and live to see my chiatrist.

Through all the emotional turmoil, in the good moments, despite the age difference, she was the most beautiful and colorful person I had met since my mother (who passed away when I was 12). I miss her and I hate her. And I know that this \"love\" thing is some projection, some neuronal activity. But consciousness, however subjective, is still consciousness.These past few weeks have broken mental boundaries that in hindsight I became accustomed to while with her, especially as we lived together, and the idea of suicide seems to makes perfect sense. It's not out of desperation or sadness - depression mainly - but the rationale seems to be as clear as a blue sky.Out of all of the anger and betrayal, I feel I can understood where she had come from - or at least convince myself in whatever self-rationalization melody that comes to my mind. Is she worse than me? Maybe? Maybe not? In my late teens and early 20's (probably until about 23-24; I am 28 now), I'd be guilty, mainly as a result of alcohol, of trying to sleep with girls that had boyfriends or friends of an ex. Largely to fuel a fairly insecure ego, there was a unique taboo thrill that was otherwise non-existent. The girls were either non-complying or they would paint their partners in such a way that it would attenuate the guilt for both of us. My attempts usually failed, but moral deontology seems most fitting. Around 25, I had a couple of mushroom and LSD experiences, and realised how toxic and maladaptive and painful this was for both myself and others. I tried my best to forgive myself and apologise to anyone whom I have hurt.This cheating has triggered a lot of that. In a way, I can understand where the guy has come from. In another way, though I don't believe in karma, it does seem like some cosmic punishment. I have never cheated, but if under the right circumstances, and in the age bracket of 19-23, would I have done just as she had did?But this experience has allowed me to 'unlock' a certain emotion and pain that I had only heard about from friends or see in movies. The pain that I may have caused other people is palpable. I tried my best to be a good person to my girlfriend - I made mistakes, and said regretful things in anger, but most of the time I forgave a lot of her emotional breakdowns and verbal abuse, and in our good moments I tried to be loving, compassionate, and caring. When we both had good days, I marvelled at the depth of her self-awareness and humor. But now I wonder if it was just her ability to easily adapt to others (more than me). I never had a compulsion to cheat - there were temptations about other girls, and fantasies, sure, but the idea of being with someone else was completely alien.\"Love\" seemed like such a powerful force beyond anything hedonistic. I guess that's why I find it difficult to fathom her direct rationale (though I can still understand that it's more complex than just good people and bad people), but can understand where the guy - whom I hate - comes from.But maybe there are bad people and I am too understanding? Personality disorders, and sociopathy, are certainly true. Just disordered people? I think I am too understanding to people's actions and abuse as a way to admit the truth about people. I did this with my alcoholic mother, and I think it's a fairly entrenched coping mechanism to pretend I am 'psychoanalysing' people when deep down I can't assimilate that there are bad people without a modicum of good.But I have always appreciated Carl Jung's concept of the \"shadow\". I think all of us, given the right circumstances and environment, are capable of causing severe pain to others -- rooted in delusion, manipulation, or hedonism. The resolution is to become aware of this side of this rather than suppress it. So, I guess I see \"bad people\" as not accepting their shadow but being overwhelmed by it. This all seems to conflict with modern day psychology, and getting fairly pseudo, but I cannot help but espouse a deep affinity to Jung's work.It seems that I either want to help and be kind to others, or indulge hedonistically in selfish acts that will cause pain to others. There's no in between. It's almost schizophrenic. How can I help people as a psychologist myself, or in writing or music, if I will carry around a \"shadow\" for the rest of my existence?Will I succumb to desires and try and sleep with girls again that have partners? A part of me desperately wants to. And knowing the pain I experience now, to be the guy that causes that to others would be too much to bare.So if I can't help people, because I can hurt people, I don't see a reason to live. If I'm not in love, and invested, I can easily see myself using alcohol again and hurting people. My only issue is that I'll hurt my father and some close family and friends in my death. I have a lot of people that \"know\" me, and appreciate the concept with me, but I'm close with a rare few. To the majority, I will become shock value to the people that know of me, and talk will circulate for a week or two, and suicide awareness statuses on Facebook will come up (\"YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PEOPLE\"), and people will pretend to 'mourn' me since that would be the train to jump on, but not many people will miss me since not many people know me. But, no matter how many words I write, nobody will understand directly my experience - nor will I understand yours.For the people that do know me, I was considering recording a piano album and then travelling overseas to South East Asia and maybe India. There overseas I plan to write and bleed my journey (sorry these words are shitty; I can't think very clear lately) and conclude it with a suicide letter. I'd try my best to explain to the people that do love me that it had to be done, and that suicide, if given clear thought, shouldn't be completely frowned upon. There's a difference between suicide out of mental illness and suicide based on lengthy deliberation. Why am I not allowed to check out of this dream of life? It's all a brief dream before we return to the void. If I can't help people because I've hurt people, and I've recorded my music and written a story, then what else is there to do? Grow old and enter a job I hate?This idea may go out the window tomorrow, since my suicidal ideation is coming in waves, and I am seeing a psychologist, but I honestly can't think of why I shouldn't suicide if: a) I explain to the people I love why I had to do it; b) I complete certain creative outlets. There's nothing else to do. I've fallen in love. I've been betrayed. I've hurt people. I've helped people. I'll travel a bit. What else is there? Grow old? Nothing is nearly as special after the first time, is it? There's nothing I can do besides working in the helping profession. And even if it's not about hurting people, how can I help people if I struggle with mental health myself? Maybe this suicide rationale is not so \"clear\" but stems from a bleak depression and I'm not admitting it to myself? So, if I am killing myself for the story, likely in some disassociated state, I haven't worked out where or how? If I do something transparently poetic, I'll be seen as something more than I am or considered more crazy. I don't know what I am writing.In all my previous depressions, I never thought of suicide as the answer. But it finally makes sense. It's so simple. I'm rambling on.

This is going to be another long post full of self-pity and self-loathing. I'm not the most talented writer, but feel free to laugh with me or at me.I'm 34 now, I can't believe I've made it this long. I REALLY hate life. I do not recall ever requesting to be born, if I did I surely wasn't old enough to make that decision when I did. I know no one ever gets to \"choose\" whether or not they're born and that's just the very first example of life being inherently unfair. You neither get to choose to be born, and society damn sure doesn't want you to choose when you die.Before I digress too much let me get back on track. You now know my age, that I hate my life, and probably have put together the fact that I want to die. It won't be this week or next, but soon a promise I made will have been kept, I will not agree(even if it's on her deathbed) to further extend my life. When I was younger my mother discovered a close family friend who had committed suicide by shotgun, I don't know whether it was the gruesome scene that stuck with her or the fact that the family friend had made the decision to end his life unilaterally and didn't allow anyone to act to prevent him from doing so that stuck with her, but I promised as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive that I would not go through with any plans. Fortunately(for me) my mother is nearing the end of her life. A few years ago she was diagnosed with Acromegaly, basically a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and causes excessive amounts of HGH to enter the blood stream. It doesn't cause too much damage on its own, but it caused enough problems that she had to have it biopsied. She was also diagnosed with Lupus. She's a strong woman, no it's not an oedipus complex or anything. She was a single mom who raised my brother and I virtually alone. My father was around but was never much of a father. He cheated on her, they divorced. She went back to school and became a nurse and despite growing up in(and continuing to exist in) poverty I know that I was loved. Because of her, I've avoided most of the major pitfalls in life-drugs, tobacco, gambling, alcohol addiction. I've got a borderline addiction with computer gaming, but I frequently go weeks without touching the computer just to prove to myself that I can.Anyway I was not the best student. I was too smart for my own good. I always HATED teachers who used to assign tons of homework and say \"If you don't do my homework, you won't pass my tests.\" Don't get me wrong, I get why homework is given-I always have, it's just I always took that statement as a challenge and I accepted it if the subject was not one of particular interest to me. Long story short, I wouldn't do the homework, WOULD pass their tests, ace their finals/midterms and end up passing with a low-mid 70's grade. Towards the end of High School I finally grew up a bit and realized that my stubbornness was only hurting myself, and would not cause the teachers to be honest. I did better in my junior year, and made high honor roll for my entire junior year and the first half of my senior year. Sadly, the damage had already been done and my transcript made me look like an idiot. Thankfully, I had never really envisioned college in my long term plans. Back in the 7th or 8th grade there was this test called the Occupational Outlook Handbook which was supposed to help you figure out what you wanted to do with your life. I never enjoyed computer programming. I had a buddy that was in to that, the closest I ever got to coding was back when I had an old Tandy and had that spiral bound notebook where you had to manually enter the code for the games BEFORE you could play them. I wish I took more enjoyment from coding, but I've always enjoyed building and troubleshooting them. I remember saving up and ordering an AMD K6 166mhz processor, buying the parts and building my first system. First teaching myself what goes where and how everything connected. Then firing it up and learning post errors and FINALLY getting it to start up, learning how to format a HDD and install DOS, Windows, an old game Fokker, eventually I got a hold of a game called Descent. Anyway, long story short I LOVED that stuff. So when I took this test and it told me about the wonderful opportunities for PC Repair Technicians and the impressive salary(45-60,000 a year) that technicians were supposed to make I was sold. Getting paid to do what you love, that's every mans dream, right?So, I planned High School out to situate myself to get into the workforce as a technician. My city had this program called BOCES which prepared students for a career right out of high school. They had a ton of different programs from Electricians, Electronics repair, automotive repair, CIS programs, nursing programs, they had a TON of programs. Naturally I saw the CIS program and jumped at the opportunity. My Junior year I began taking CIS I, which sadly was basically a joke. It was a course teaching people how to use Microsoft Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint, some Access). It seemed more like a course designed to train secretaries and \"Executive Assistants\" but whatever I was learning something about computers. I was not exactly thrilled, especially when my brother went through the program a year before me and was learning about AS400 systems and windows servers. I was told when I finally asked about this towards the end of the year that \"some of that\" would be covered in year 2 of the program. I was pissed, but then something happened I never expected. My senior year was coming ahead and the school announced that next year they'd be piloting a one-year program called \"A+ Computer Repair\". I was like a kid in a candy store when I found out. I signed up and was(no exaggeration) the best student in the class. I graduated with a perfect score, I'd sometimes skip regular school and stay there to do a double class some days just to learn more. I would be sent to other classes that were having computer problems to fix their shit-I once saved a paper a Finish program(single mothers finishing high school) student had on a floppy disk that was corrupted(her 3.5\" disk was failing). I opened the file in edit and copied/pasted all that I could into a new file on the HDD. The girl was hot as hell and was so grateful she didn't know how she could ever thank me enough. I felt like a hero and a pig for having a response in my mind that I'd never dare speak. On that day I felt like I was made to do that kind of work.So I graduated High School on schedule in the year 2001 with a somewhat crappy GPA(except this program where I had 4 quarters of 100+'s). I took my certification exam, got certified and I went out to search for those lucrative \"PC Repair Technician\" jobs I was told were coming and were going to be in such high demand.Ok, so not very many available in/around Buffalo, NY. I did what I had to do to get some experience and earn some cash. I took a job at one of the first \"Outsourcing Technical Support\" companies, a crappy company called ClientLogic. They handled support for a bunch of different companies from Sony to Iomega to Netzero. I was hired on at Sony. I put in the time there, hating it. I was making 8.25 an hour and it wasn't about solving problems, it was about getting people off the phone in under 8 minutes. Call after call of being yelled at, being told how shitty Sony products were. I wasn't just supporting sony PC's, I was supporting their WebTV products, their TV's, DVD players, DSS receivers, and yes their VAIO PC's and laptops. I grew to hate my job, but I was earning experience. Until...One day I showed up for work and was told they were relocating their operations and closing down their call center. It turns out they were moving to India or the Bahamas, I don't remember- I just remember that was my first encounter with \"outsourcing\" and \"globalization.\"So I moved on and found another(better) job working for an ISP called Adelphia. Long story short I was hired during the beginning of their bankruptcy process. I was told I'd have job security and would be doing technical support with an opportunity to advance through the company.I did the job and got great performance reviews and helped a lot of customers. Every so often I'd get some crappy supervisor who'd tell me \"It's not your responsibility to fix that, you need to transfer those calls to tier 2\". I was only in tier 1, we were classified as \"reboot monkeys\" by the tier 2's/3's. I refused to wear that label so I fixed everything I could. I'd argue with my supervisors, who'd wonder how I managed to keep my AHT so low(so I could earn my bonus) and go so far beyond. Well, I'm not saying I was a great employee, my phone had a lot of problems with calls randomly \"dropping\". One 15 minute call and 1 2 second call creates an AHT of 7:30. I justified it to myself by reminding myself that when I was hired I was told that my job would be to help customers resolve their internet connectivity problems. I was also told that I'd have the opportunity to advance.Long story short, after 3 years the company was sold off to Time Warner and Comcast and split. Our \"secure\" jobs now weren't. I walked out the day they rebranded us from Tier 1 Support to CCRHSIT1. CCR standing for Customer Care Representative. Along with the re-branding came a new QA policy, if I failed to offer to take a credit card payment at the beginning of EVERY call I'd get a Zero QA(which DQ'd me from my bonus for the month and would get me a disciplinary warning/write up). I said to my supervisor \"Fuck this, I was hired as technical support not just customer service. I refuse to ask people for money when the service they're already paying for isn't working\". I walked out and about 15 others did as well. Later that day I got a call from that same supervisor offering me my job. The TAC shut down a year later. I was now unemployed and job hunting. I managed to get unemployment by arguing that the position they hired me for no longer existed and I lost my job due to the transition to Time Warner. So I was looking for a new job, and not finding any. There were no computer repair technician jobs to be found.In 2005 I came out to Las Vegas to see what it was all about and opened the \"help wanted\" section of the paper and saw...jobs.Needless to say after this I moved to Las Vegas, where I've lived since December of 2006. I quickly found a job after moving with a Tradeshow Technology Rental company. There wasn't a ton of \"PC Repair\" work, but there was a lot of customizing machines, imaging, on-site networking. I got to do some traveling on the companies dime. It was a cool gig. I was promoted to Weekend Operations Lead, a SMALL raise along with the added responsibility of overseeing local weekend operations. I was happy.And then the national economy tanked. The company only made 1.6 million in profit that year instead of the 1.9 million from the year before. The head of the company decided he wanted out of the industry and sold the company to a competitor. Just like that I was unemployed again. Only now the economy was in the shitter and there were no jobs to be had. I had to sell my place and move back in with my mother. Even though my place was next door to hers(yes, a trailer) I couldn't afford the lot-rent without a job, so I sold it off. Yeah, good luck trying to date when you're approaching 30, unemployed, and live with your mom. Finally, a friend from that past job got me an opportunity at a major casino doing IT Support for the Hotel and Casino(hint, their symbol is a giant Guitar). The pay was nowhere near the 45-60k a year I was promised but it was better than any job I'd had before($18/hour). There were tons of new systems and technology to familiarize myself with. I had to learn so much, and I did. IDF locations, Virtual Servers and machines, network monitoring, active directory, the IBM i5 system, and so much more. About 9 months later in early December of 2012 I was called in on my day off along with 4 other employees.We were told that the new VP of Operations was hired earlier in the year and has decided that the IT department didn't need to be manned 24 hours a day. As such the budget would be slashed significantly. That means personnel cuts. That means we're out of our jobs. Don't worry about the chaos that happens when the night club can't process all of their credit card transactions at 3am because one of them is \"stuck\". Don't worry about the hell that happens when the print server crashes at 3am and NOBODY can print in the entire hotel/casino. But that's ok, because the new VP gets to say that she cut 150+ grand in annual unnecessary costs in the IT department.No severance package for me(because I wasn't there for over a year), no unemployment either(I was only there about 9 months). And that's when I gave up.I realized then that there's no longer such a thing as employer-employee loyalty. Gone are the days where you can expect to hold a job for 30 years and then retire. How sad is that, my goal in life was to work for some place at a modest wage, be a good little wage slave and then retire. I couldn't even be granted that dignity. Nope.Our society's become a place where the only people that have any sense of job security are the people at the top or those who make themselves indispensable to a company. IT support is an industry where that's just not possible. Now you've got entire companies outsourcing their IT to MSO's. Who do everything in their power to drive down the wages. So I said fuck it, and I haven't had a job since. I refused to be a part of a system that would use me and discard me like a dixie cup. Secretly I wanted a comet to kill me and put me out of my misery.I refused to get a job. My mother had an injury and went on workers comp, I still refuse to get a job). She insisted everything be put in my name(so if/when she gets sick and needs hospice they can't force her to sell it). This also means she can't throw me out, because everything on paper belongs to ME. I don't defend this, I know I'm being selfish and childish and risking homelessness. They've stopped her workers comp(her lawyer's fighting to get her comp for life, so the insurance company is playing hardball). She's worried about not being able to pay the rent and winding up homeless. That would suck, but I don't care. I refuse to be a part of that system. I told her long ago that I wouldn't end my life as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive. That's it.We're now living off of her Social Security Disability. A little over 1,100 a month. Rent, utilities, car payment, insurance. SNAP and Medicaid. If her comp doesn't get restored soon, I imagine the first thing to go will be my car and the insurance. Then we should be able to get by, barely. As for utilities, we have Cox, I have a phone, she has a safelink minute phone, and we qualified last year for LI-HEAP. If the worst case happens and we end up facing eviction she can move back to NY with her friend. I'll just use that 80-grain .40 cal S&amp;W that I've got stored in my safe. I've told her as much. I've been to counseling, but I refuse to even try anti-depressants. On the permit to carry concealed weapons there's a question \"Do you currently or have you ever taken Anti-Depressants\". Answering yes to that denies you from being issued a permit.Additionally, there's been a lot of push and talk about disarming people who are on anti-depressants. They also take away your firearms if you're ever taken in on a 5150 hold. My firearm is a part of my \"Exit strategy\" it's elaborate and it insures that the police will find me, not some random housekeeper. If I ever get taken in on a 5150 or lose my firearms another way I'll have to switch to plan B which involves turning a firing range into a bloody mess and traumatizing a bunch of people. Removing my firearm wouldn't stop me, I'm smart enough to know how to gain access to one legally. Anyway, I talked to a therapist back in 2014 and laid all this out to her and explained that I am suicidal, but not imminently so(so she isn't required to call 911)because of the promise I made to my mother. Her response \"If something ever happens to your mom, you should give me a call and we'll get you some help\". Are you fucking kidding me, does she think I'm an idiot? I'm telling her I want to die, but won't as long as she's alive and you think I'm going to call you when she dies so you can have me committed-so the police can take my weapons and the doctors can force-feed me pills and evaluate me until I can convince them I'm not a risk to myself. She insulted my intelligence, and I called her out on it and told her as much. She smiled...wtf?A few sessions later, she tells me I should \"go get a job to let my mind focus on other things\". As if it wasn't the never-ending pattern of getting a job/losing said job to no fault of my own that put me in this headspace. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm out. I haven't went back since. So now here I am, my mom's health's deteriorating, every day I wake up knowing my mom's one day closer to passing away. I love her dearly and have honored and will continue to honor the promise I made. Having said that I will not be granting any deathbed pleas she may make. I know she wants me to go on living, but I don't want to live in this world. Even before Trump got elected president I didn't like where this country and the world in general were headed. I didn't like that I was constantly shamed for having my so called \"white privilege\" even though I grew up just as poor as possible.Even though I watched less-qualified applicants get jobs because of affirmative action. Only for those applicants to quit or get fired a week later and see the same job opening back up. I didn't like that globalization and automation were utterly decimating jobs, leading to staggering levels of unemployment(and the creation of a class of people like myself who have been unemployed for so long we're now excluded from the unemployment percentage). Those jobs that remained after automation and globalization are now so heavily in demand by applicants fresh out of school or recently unemployed that wages have become a race to the bottom. A culture has been created where we should \"just be grateful to have a job\" even though the jobs suck, the pay sucks, the benefits suck, you're constantly under threat of being terminated by terrible bosses. I hate that it seems like I want my mother to die. I don't, I love her dearly. I just refuse to be another cog in the machine called \"society\". I wish we lived in a world with an implemented UBI, so I could actually just focus on enjoying my life or doing something with my life and time instead of hating myself for being alive. I realize my behavior is that of a damn parasite. Let's talk \"romance and sex life\" for a moment, I've had 1 girlfriend in my entire life. She was my first everything, she also cheated on me and I was dumb enough to take her back about 6 different times over our 3 years together. Eventually she got pregnant by another guy, that's when we finally ended it for good. I've had sex in total with about 7 different woman in my life. 5 of which were prostitutes. I'm no Brad Pitt. I'm fat, have a hunchback(from having to walk home while lugging about 50 pounds of books every night during my freshman/sophmore years of high school.) Oh about those prostitutes I mentioned, I once disgusted a prostitute to the point where she made a sound indicating she was repulsed when I sweat on her face during the missionary position. Not saying that was traumatizing, but for fuck sake. I realize that many of you may be judging me, some may be laughing at me, and others may have platitudes to offer to try and cheer me up, I appreciate you reading all of this, I realize it's been a giant wall of text with no TL;DR. Having said that, I don't think anything you have to say will help. You may think I need anti-depressants, and maybe according to some doctors I do. Then again maybe I'm just an example of a genetic mutation that should be removed from the gene pool of our species.

I am average on school. i get 7s and 8s (same as B, B-, C), but my dad always tells me how bad i am and will never get a job. My dad was a coder before the company outsourced to India. Now he has calmed down, but is turning into alcoholic. He usualy drinks a bottle of whiskey or wine a day. I hate myself, because i think a lot of thinks and want to tell abaut them, but when i open my mouth nothing comes out. I just cant transform my thought to actual conversation. I only have a few friends, because i find most of my age naive brats. I have come to the point that i dont care abaut my appearance. I am skinny guy with usualy jean and a t shirt or hoodie. I dont care abaut sports so i am not muscular. I like food, but i am borderline underweight, because i spend my time on computer drinking energy drinks and not eating anything.

As i was only child my dad allways on back and i didnt have any time alone. He allways came to my room and shouted to me how i am a failure and a mistake. I ran away to my mom, but thinks didnt get better. She was full alcoholic and i was depressed. Couple of year ago my uncle from dads side was died and i got a big amount of money (around 100k Euros). Just before i turned 18 my mom stole the money from my account (i was underage and needed a adult for account) and ran away to north and cut contacts. Then i was near suicide, but i called my dad and we got along a little better. Now the problem is i know i am mentally unstable and need a proof from doctor. I dont want to go to army so i need the proof. I think i can do ok in army but cant take the social interactions. If i get it my dad will throw me out, because he dosnt think i am mentaly ill, but that i am a pussy. Allso i secretly crossdress and use sextoys on my anal and pretend to be a girl. I have accepted that thats what i am, but still there is a thought in my mind that am doing something wrong.

Every second of my life suffocates me. I'm all alone and I have no one to talk to or share my feelings with. I'm a second year medical student right now, started medical school in the fall of 2014 but had to split my first year into 2 years because I couldn't handle the stress and my depression at the same time. Came back the second year and somehow managed to finish first year with an 85% average. Now with second year and my USMLE step 1 licensing exam coming up I'm finding myself having a hard time again. It's not that the content is difficult for me, it's my low self-esteem and depressive thoughts that make medical school hard for me. I went to the school counselor to seek help and was referred to the school's psychiatry department this past May. I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me Welbutrin. However, after 5 months of religiously taking Welbutrin it’s not working. Antidepressants can mask symptoms at best but the root problem still remains the same. I tried seeing a psychologist back in 2013 but that didn't seem to be of help either. I hate the very core of my being. I hate my personality, the way I interact with people, how I always get awkward during social situations with new people, and the way I look. I constantly compare myself to other guys who I think look better and have more muscular physiques. Last year I weighed close to 200 lbs. but hit the gym and got down to 155. I gained a little bit of muscle during the process but by no means do I have an extremely muscular physique. Having a good muscular physique has always been my dream but low self-confidence gets the best of me. Whenever, I make a resolution to gain more muscle I always end up self-sabotaging my efforts by sometimes skipping the gym and not sticking to my diets religiously. My mind constantly tells me that it’s useless since I won't be able to put in the dedication to achieve such an accomplishment. As a result months pass by and I don't make any progress. My social life is non-existent. I barely have any friends in medical school. My medical school is like high school where everybody is grouped into cliques and the people like me who are outcasts are left to struggle with the hurdles of med school alone. A part of me feels dead when I see other classmates being socially well integrated in their support groups enjoying medical school. They seem to study and get good grades effortlessly and enjoy it at the same time while being socially active. Whenever I pass by my classmates and look at their faces all I see is people who seem to hate me and are indifferent towards me. I even try to initiate conversations but none of them are receptive. Its like they've already made up their minds about anyone who is not in their clique. Most of them even have good personal lives with a significant other. Meanwhile nobody has ever shown interest in me for my whole life. I go to parties with my parents and people compliment me on my looks but I think they're lying. I'm 6ft tall yet I feel so short in comparison to my classmates who are 6'2, 6'3, 6'4. My mind constantly eats away at me. I feel like I'm going to suffer this life and die alone. I'm an only child and my parents are all I have in this world. My parent's are already in their mid 60's and everyday I worry that I'm going to loose them and be left alone in this world. Most of my extended family is half way across the world in India. Almost all of my cousins are 35 or above and married with children so I never related with any of them. I'm 24 about to turn 25 in 2 months in December. I just feel that I should have accomplished so much in my life by now and should have been comfortable and well adjusted in my skin by now. I should have found my place and people in this world by now. I feel that I'm a thoughtful and caring person. I can't say no to anybody who needs me and always put the needs of others before myself. I'm a religious person and try to pray to God everyday. But for some reason my prayers are falling upon deaf ears. I must genuinely be a flawed person, even God has given up on me.  Everyday that passes by makes me feel like I'm loosing my youth and wasting away the best part of my life. I've tried talking to my parents but they just don't understand. Overall, Indian parents aren't that in tune with emotional issues. After suffering for what seems like an eternity I have no desire to live anymore. All the doors in my life have closed, I can't see any way out of this hell. I just want to die. I have plans to kill myself on my 25th birthday. Either way, it won't make an ounce of difference to anybody. People say that everyone was placed on this Earth for a purpose, I guess mine was to serve as a reminder to people on what suffering is and to count their blessings. I just didn't want to leave this world without getting this off my chest. Thank you to anyone who took the effort to take a few minutes of their day to read this.

The very same winter, I was in a minor fender bender at a parking lot with a bicyclist, really nothing dramatic. I rolled out of the driveway and a bicyclist came, so I stepped on the breaks and she stopped in front of me. Long story short, she got mad and punched the car and when she stepped aside I drove off. She ended up reporting me to the police for harassment, assault, failure to give way and hit-and-run, claiming I hit her, twice, with the car on purpose.This stress led to me dropping the course I was taking at the start of spring. I still had my bachelor to do, so I promised myself I would finish it so I could move on with my life, so I applied for the bachelor course and did the practical work this spring. To afford rent, I had to get a summer job and since my thesis data was delayed because I had to wait for optimal plant length, I had to write the report itself over the summer.On top of the court case, the summer job and the thesis, I had a surgery this summer that I have been waiting for for over 9 months which was a phimosis surgery, essentially an adult circumcision. The phimosis itself was a heavy load on my mind the last 22 years. Several times I tried to have sex and they all ended in total embarassment, and I have never been able to have a romantic relationship whatsoever. The surgery itself was one of the worst things I've ever experienced, rough scrubbing, 7 or 8 shots in my penis root for local anesthesia, rough recovery period. Now the wound has healed, but working full time as a personal assistant + thesis writing is driving me off the edge, and reddit's anti-circumcision rhetoric in every threat makes me feel regret and anxiety over having the surgery.**PRESENT DAY**I feel incredible anxiety answering the phone or even checking my email, and even if I see an email from my supervisor I avoid looking at it for days because I know I will feel even worse if I read it. I cry every single day, I feel like I can't breathe, I avoid my roommate because I am so drained after work every day and I don't want to talk to anyone, resulting in almost complete isolation this summer. I have already postponed my bachelor twice at this point because I've been too stressed to write, and I am taking a year off to work starting this fall so I can travel but I have no work lined up after August and I barely have energy to take a shower in the morning. I don't know what to do at this point, I feel like my life is going face down into the mud and I don't have the energy to get up again. My parents are very supportive but they can't help me.I can't keep all these balls rolling, and on top of that I am so incredibly soul-crushingly lonely. I live in a country where circumcision is very rare, so on top of the troubles I've had all along, showing it to a girl makes me feel terror. I don't know how to act in bed in the first place, and sharing my thoughts and feelings and interests and even preference in music/film/games makes me feel vulnerable and weak so I try to hide it away instead. I have no motivation to meet people, or work, or play games, or take walks or anything at all really. Nothing is fun anymore. I sleep like shit at night and I'm always tired. I have a trip to India planned for November and a trip on the Siberian railway planned for next summer but I couldn't care less, I'd rather die right now and get it over with. I live in a place of real opportunity and many things in my life are objectively really good, and I feel ungrateful for not enjoying them, I feel selfish.

I no longer have any reason to panic about anything. I've been applying for jobs, going to work interviews, working restlessly on my upcoming YouTube videos, cooking, cleaning my room, moisturizing, doing my eyebrows, etc.I used to be scared of the dark as a kid, when I was around 7-9. So scared, one day I peed my pants while sitting on the couch with the lights on, because I was so scared to walk through the dark hallway. My parents were away at the time, apartment was dead quiet. Nowadays I could watch horror films before going to bed, think about them while I'm lying in bed .. and still have a good night's sleep. Think about the movie Lights Out, yeah. My kind of movie. You can't kill that which is already dead. If anything, it is me who has become the phantom, the creeping silhouette waving at you from outside your bedroom window, from the corner of your eye. I should already be fucking dead, but never mind. I have been granted a unique power. I have been granted immunity from Earthly troubles. Nothing really matters to me .. debt, work, responsibility, bills, careers, homework, grades, marriage, etc. Stick it up your ass. Maybe I only pretend to care about these things, because I'm jealous of the living. However, as time goes by, this jealousy is transformed into second hand embarrassment. I'm supposed to be dead. There's no way I could have possibly continued living up till this point. I spent 2 years on welfare since the age of 19 .. that money could have gone to somebody who was disabled, instead of my own de facto existence.Many people have abused this power, the power of not caring about a damn thing in the world, the power of being unpunishable by the consequences of the real world. I want to be remembered as somebody, who used this power in order to do good things, such as saving lives, perhaps .. or donating lots of money to charity by selling shit loads of drugs or something, and then ending my life. A British couple once carried out such a plot. They got 3 years behind bars. Sadly, such good deeds always go unnoticed .. it's always terrorists and mass shooters who get all the media coverage, vile scum.I don't have any fucking friends ... so peddling drugs will probably never work. (don't raid me .. I don't have shit in this room. I'm an alcoholic, not a drug addict.)Starting a torrent site may be a better idea for a suicidal charity fundraiser, actually. As far as I can recall, Pirate Bay raked 4 million dollars every year. If I could make one tenth of that, it would still be lots of money. It's a victimless crime, literally nobody is harmed, and it pays well. Give 75% to charity, use the rest to sustain what is left of my existence .. and the deed is done. If I get busted, I can always finish it before my court date. I get what I want, which is death and freedom from Life and it's shittiness .. and thousands of people end up having money for their cancer surgeries. Sounds like a plan.God, I feel so much better now that I wrote this. What's your favourite beer, anyway? I like India Pale Ale.

My gf passed away in grade 10 in a car accident because I insisted her to watch my final game. It was supposed to be my last cricket game in India before I left for Canada with my family. I always blamed myself for her death and just felt like shit. In highschool, I didn't really fit in because I came in grade 10 when most students had already made their groups in grade 9. I didn't speak the language that well, so I was just afraid to talk in general and I was poor at understanding the social structure of western society.I went to university and made 2 friends who got me into League of Legends and I played that game like no tomorrow. I didn't make much friends as a result and my performance in school wasn't the greatest. I ended up switching programs and make great progress. I did my work, helped with researched and talked to people. I am known to be one of the most extroverted people on the campus yet I do not have a single close friend. I decided to date and obviously didn't succeed. I just came back from a date and everything went really well but 2 hours later she told me that her boyfriend would be coming over. She didn't even tell me that she had a bf!?!! Ok, a'ight.....it happens. I feel like I am just garbage who probably talks a lot and people just want to make fun of me. Here is the thing though: I know that because of my low self-esteem, which probably look a hit after my gf died, I tend to engage in confirmation bias and only pick on instances where I have underperformed. However, I just feel terrible saying that I have finished my 5 years at university without dating anyone at all. It probably is trivial but I am afraid of telling people the truth and lie about being in relationships. It is generally not accepted if you are a guy with less-experience and I feel bad about myself.

I don't know if this is the proper place, but I thought I should probably ask for help because I know that I tend to keep all these negatives feelings inside me and do other stupid shit. I feel adding to that fact that I am always surrounded by negativity when I am doing research (terrorism everywhere, hatred for people, etc etc)...it adds and amplifies the negative feelings inside me because I feel my research is ultimately going to be useless.

I live in a third world country(India, to be specific.), where life is just not worth it anymore. Ever since I was little, I've had one specific goal. One dream. One ambition in life and I know most of you are going to laugh at me when I say this, but I really wanted to be an astronaut when I would grow up. I wanted to travel to space and view the earth and moon and the sun and the stars. And yes, I know that I can do that using Google, but I want to physically achieve it, feel the feeling of being in space among the stars and truly, I think it would be beautiful. And yes, I know you can do that playing video games too(I've played Mass Effect, yes), but it's not reality. I've finished my Bachelor's degree in Engineering with \"ok\" grades. And boy, I've suffered through the whole ordeal of education. My scores of the entrance test for engineering weren't that great so I ended up in an institution which took me 2 hours of travel everyday to get to and back home and the faculty was really bitchy, without having any knowledge of the field whatsoever(some were good, most were really bad). They treated most of us students like crap. Always favored the ass lickers and made sure students like me faced a hard time. So, basically it was hell for me, but I still survived through it because it was my only choice of leaving the country to join any human space program(India has none and will never have one). So, now that it's over I go looking for requirements to join maybe NASA or something. And guess what do I find? I need to be a citizen of the country to be part of their space program. The U.S. won't grant me a citizenship(getting a Green Card is an achievement alone, but not good enough for NASA). Russia is the same story. So I just realized, whatever I do, I can't be an astronaut. I just can't. And it's really sad, because it's something I'm so passionate about. The worst thing is, it's not even my fault. I'm just unlucky I guess to be born in a place with nothing for me. Over the last few weeks, my parents have tried to convince me to find other interests, but I can't.

Then there was this silence on the phone and he said okay, I thought it is our duty to make sure you have everything in your life but if you don't want to, I don't know what else I can do. We are also getting older and we would love for our generation and genes to continue. I did not stop there, I went far and said is it not enough that I am supporting you financially, why don't you both leave me alone, I don't ever want to see you again, I will just send you money and I am cancelling my trip, please do not ever call me again and hung up.After that, I feel extremely guilty for disrespecting my dad and speaking the way I spoke to him and I feel very suicidal now. I want to send all the money I have now in my savings to them and just go quiet for a week and jump off Niagara.I have come along way since last 6 months getting better physique, and everthing and now I can't deal with the guilt and also getting trapped in this arranged marriage thing, I don't know what else I can do. The guilt is killing me now and I am always worried if my parents will pass away and often have nighmares about getting a call that one of them is in the hospital.I don't think I can live through that. At the same time, I feel like I am stuck at this right now.I have no one to talk to personally about this, as I am all alone in Canada, the friends I have are more like aquantainces and I don't usally discuss personal matters with anyone. This is a throw away.The drive of suicide is strong at this moment, the only  reason I haven't done it yet is I want to transfer my money to them before I do it.

I am a 33 year old male from India( as you can see I am not that young). I am unmarried. I come from a typical middle class background, all my family are professionals. I have a Degree in mechanical engineering and an MBA..all through paid seats. I was never good academically (never really bad as well), never into sports, cultural stuff. I currently have a job that's decent, however not satisfactory. I earn less than my classmates but more than that I have never understood my job.I ve changed jobs three times ( all jobs through reference rather than talent). I don't have assertiveness in me, and if I try to be assertive I come out either weak or very arrogant.My love life is non existant. I ve proposed couple of girls they didn't want anything to do with me. Still a virgin. Live alone in Vadodara. Spend my time trying to understand what to do with life. I ve been told to take up hobbies..I ve spent a lot but never enjoyed. The only thing I enjoy is a little photography but I am not good or creative. I just copy.I don't have the zeal to live, I ve tried killing myself failed miserably I hate looking at that ugly face in the mirror I want companionship never found it.

(Not currently suicidal but feel you guys can help)", "selftext": "Alright guys so I've been hanging around these forums writing up posts all the time and different crazy ideas I have but this time I could probably do with some advice. From time to time i do get very suicidal but I feel that lies a lot on being back in the UK and not traveling, hence why I posted here (I've posted in the bipolar support group too as I'm not sure if I could post in both). Anyway I went to visit what I thought would be a psych today, turns out it was just a person who refers me to see a psych so I got put on another waiting list to see a psych after 4 weeks. This as you can imagine is quite frustrating, I left Australia a couple of months ago as I thought it was going to be good for me to have the support of my family and get medical specialist attention quicker but turns out it was quite the opposite.So Now I have choices, I've already booked a flight to Australia for next week on a whim because the flights were cheap. I fly to Perth from the UK for £380 and the plan would be to make my way to Melbourne to work at a ladies house helping her out with certain chores, practicing yoga (she works for a yoga studio) and meditation and hopefully gain my second year visa in Australia which would require 88 days of regional work. I've emailed her today to make sure this is all ok as I don't think she quite believes I'm going to fly all the way from the UK so I'm going to wait and hear what she has to say. Down falls of this choice is I'd be quite secluded, in an area where I'm not going to know many people but I guess I can get to know people.My other two choices are this. My flight to Australia flys via Bali, a place known for being spiritual. I'm really trying to explore my spirtuality if you can't tell as I feel like i really need to discover myself and try and figure out how to be content with life. I received an email back from a place today that said I can stay there for 10 days and do a pretty intense silent mediation routine aimed at dealing with the stressers of life. It's pretty intense, like no talking at all for the majority of the time while there. Have to dress modestly, no use of technology, no books etc. So it's pretty hardcore. It would be an extreme change and maybe what I need but also could it be too much? This is the site if you want to check it out? http://www.java.dhamma.org/indexeng.htm They even have a disclaimer on the email saying \"By completing the accompanying application to participate in a ten-day Vipassana meditation course, the applicant acknowledges the foregoing warning and in consideration of being permitted to participate in the course knowingly grants to the organisers of this course, Vipassana Meditation, and its associated organisations including Vipassana Centres and teachers, a complete, total and unequivocal release of any and all liability for any adverse mental or physical consequences which may result directly or indirectly from such participation.\"So yeah a bit worrying haha.Anyway 3rd choice, I can fly to Portugal tomorrow and meet up with a bunch of friends I met travelling last year and travel with them for a while. They love to party which is something I will have to try and avoid for the time being s obviously drink and drugs are not good for people with mental issues but they all love me and are super supportive. I then have the opportunity to either travel with one group to Turkey or with my one friend to Croatia to work for a while then maybe India (I'd probably have to forget about Australia if I took this trip or at east postpone it for a while). This would be good for me to be surrounded by friends but also the temptation of slipping back into the party lifestyle would be there, however i do think I've grown enough to avoid this and just enjoy being with people and traveling.My final I guess option is to just stay home I guess but as of now things aren't really improving. Doctors take so long to see, I keep getting put on and taken off medication and my whole faith in the system has just gone so I kind of don't really see staying here as an option anymore. I'm kind of writing this all down for myself but also to get a few opinions from you guys too. So yeah, any help appreciated. A bit of a quick background, I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, mood swings, self harm, thoughts of going crazy and all sorts of stupid stuff (there is a possibility i could be bipolar). At the minute I feel quite normal, I think getting out of here's a good choice but just making the right decision is difficult. I'm kind of swaying towards Portugal at the moment because then i have friends around me but if I'm going tomorrow that's going to be quite the rush job.

I am young (22) and I am doing great in university and I have friends and a great family and lots of potential. But everyday I wake up and hate myself and want to die. As an act of desperation and existential crisis I attempted suicide at 18, rented a hotel room, slit my wrists and swallowed 50,000 mg of tylenol. Obviously that wasn't enough to kill me, and I feel like I didn't know what sadness was until afterwards, because these last 4 years have been hell.I've been sad for as long as I can remember being conscious of sadness (maybe 6 or 7?). And I rarely have more than a week of genuine happiness, even though I've done things that would make most people happy. Sometimes I am more manic than happy and that is uncomfortable in it's own way. I was a bulimic for 8 years, now 1 year into recovery and I was hoping that would make me feel better but it didn't. In and out of shitty relationships with emotionally abusive men, and serious rifts with friends and family after the attempt. My emotions are all over the place and I feel things very deeply so it's hard to have a functional relationship.I've tried everything: self-help books, about 9 years of therapy, 6 different medications, a trip to India that included volunteering and living in an ashram, meditation/yoga, running away, staying put, self medicating with alchohol/drugs, experimenting with hallucinogens. Nothing seems to work. I make a few steps forward and then ten back. At this point I know my family and friends would be devastated, but they've watched me suffer for years and they know how terribly I need to escape, I can't keep letting them down getting better and then worse again. So I feel like somewhere within them they would understand. I'm scared of the pain f most suicide methods, and I'm scared of how horrible life would be if I attempted and failed and had brain damage or woke up in the hospital to my grandma's crying face one more time. But at what point does the sadness override the fear?I've told myself for the past 4 years…\"just wait till… and if you feel better after that you don't have to do it. But \"feeling better\" never comes and I'm tired of trying and waiting. Ultimately I hate myself and feel unworthy of love and have a really hard time making it through most days.

I wish happy birthdays on facebook, or by text. But those 'friends', don't even wish me on *my* birthday. So I stopped that shit since the last year.Now I'm just exhausted. I don't find any interest in anything really - my side projects which I think could turn into million dollar startups, or going out, or meeting new people (I'd have to cold approach). I have no interest in good food. I just goto work everyday, 13+ hours of the day get dedicated to office life. I come back home and I barely have anytime to think about anything else except eat and browse some porn and then goto sleep.I've no girlfriend, but that's okay. I have cold approached tonnes of girls (and I mean shit tonnes - like, 25-30 every week), in the last two years since I got my job (before I had no confidence, mostly because of coming across as a bum with nothing to offer). But I got only rejection. Each and every single one of them.I am fine with that too - we can't just force someone to like us the if like them. I've stopped going out completely - going out to meet women was one of the reasons I ever used to go out. I don't like wandering mindlessly in the malls etc. And my city is nowhere near as picturesque as one might think.So. No friends, no love life, a job I really don't give a shit about and bills that I'm plain bored and tired of paying. I've had it. I mean, there's really no reason to be such a living waste of life.

Before me it was just a team of six men and I was the first female. I was an iOS developer. Their app still hasn't shipped yet.So at the startup I constantly felt that I was treated differently then all the other men by the founder. Some of the other men gave me weird looks and one of them asked me out on a date. When I said no, he beat me up (violently, he broke my leg, I'm not sure how no one noticed because we were outside the office on the street where there were people), spoke rubbish about me to the founder, and I was subsequently fired. I knew I could easily be hired somewhere else, but was terrified of the possibility of bumping into him.Due to this fear, I gathered up my things and moved to NYC. I was hired by another (larger) company and was working there until this happened (not related to company, read below). I have been offered re-employment when I am ready to go back to work (currently on benefits).But then I was travelling to India on holiday over Christmas (21 Dec through 1 Jan was the intended trip length). It was probably foolish of me to go alone. The first 7 days of the trip were wonderful. I was in east India when this happened though. I was walking towards a train and then a local grabbed me on the neck from behind and started beating me. He probably chose me because I looked like a tourist (which I was). Anyways so he beat me up real bad (My legs were paralysed after this due to nerve injury and I have only regained a little movement in my left leg). Then he dragged me behind a building where there was no one else, stripped off my clothes and forcibly had sex with me. After that he took my wallet with my credit cards and cash in it. Then he left me to rot and ran off. Obviously because this was in India and I am American this is hard to take to court.After that I eventually found someone kind enough to take me to a hospital. The fees were expensive but I'm glad I got treated. I paid for it in my primary credit card which was still in my pocket. Then I was taken to an aeroport and I flew back to NYC.After I got back to NYC I have been questioning the purpose of my existence. If I am going to keep being someone's maltreated toy then what is the purpose of staying alive, other than for my family. Since returning I have been diagnosed with depression and trust issues.

Then came my first relationship, when I was about 13, while I was still in school. It lasted for about a couple of years, and when it ended, it did hurt for a couple of months, but nothing tragically wrong. Met my last GF soon after, and dated her for the next 4 years. I felt like nothing could ever go wrong between us back then. I truly believed that she was the one. (Maybe I still do? Sure do feel like I fucked up real bad by losing her.) But her parents weren't particularly fond of me, and so, well, I tried impressing them however I could. Soon, school ended and it was time to choose a college. I wanted to be a Sound Engineer and even somehow managed to get a 10% scholarship to a pretty decent college, but my dad couldn't cough up the money that it'd take. Both my parents wanted me to be an Engineer, just like all the other kids in the neighbourhood with high paying jobs. Plus, it isn't exactly considered a \"wise\" investment in India, since engineers are generally better paid. So, I had a lil chat with my then \"SO\"... She told me that she'd try to support me no matter what, but things would get extremely complicated between us if her parent found out that I wasn't pursuing a more \"elegant\" field like Engineering -- as opposed to \"sound engineering\" which no one in the country would consider \"real engineering\" despite the patience and hard work that it takes.Anyways, long story short -- I decided that it was a much safer bet to pursue Electrical engineering at a B-Grade college in my city. It was the same college that my SO's elder sister was studying in. I chose that same college, coz I wanted an excuse to be closer to my SO and I felt that being in the same college would be an excellent excuse (if nothing else) to drop by her house sometimes. Fast forward One year: I didn't get the \"top-notch\" scores in my first semester that I would've required to impress her parents (75% in Electrical Engineering as compared to her Elder sister's 90%) and she was pissed off that I hadn't tried/studied hard enough. I'm still not convinced that I did try hard enough. :(As time went on, somehow, despite the substantial time that we spent together - the distance between us was growing. She once lamented to me that the initial \"spark\" in our relationship was gone. I had no idea what she was talking about, since my entire life revolved around her by now. I intended to finish my education, get a (high paying) job, and marry her - make her mine, so that even her parents could no longer keep us apart, or judge me for not being good enough for their daughter.Soon, she started behaving rather *erratically*. One day she told me that she was trying to teach a lesson to one of our mutual acquaintance, who was cheating on his girl-friend. This acquaintance hadn't previously met her face-to-face. Her overly-elaborate plan was to herself introduce herself as a potential \"date\" to him, and somehow emotionally manipulate him to make him realize how much it hurts when someone cheats on you. I wasn't able to handle this -- for some odd reason, and felt like she was \"bored\" of me.. or even found this other guy more attractive than me. Things got somewhat bitter between us for sometime, but with time ( a few months), things got a little better again. However, I guess I was still hurting on the inside. Guess I've always been a sissy. Eventually, I found out through one of her friends, that she was cheating on me. This hurt me much more than I can ever explain in words. I tried to ask her why she'd do that, and we tried to make it work after a short hiatus, but nothing worked. I was always bitter, and might have even emotionally tortured her somewhat, but I swear I had no control over my actions by then. I was hurting real bad, and she was the only one I could talk to, coz as I said -- I had built my entire life around her, and she was my only emotional support system. I even tried to kill myself. At that point I thought this might at the very least get her attension. But something was wrong. And in a very short time, she had changed too much. The person I had loved for all these years was gone. This is where her story ends. And I feel like I'm still stuck there -- even 5 years after that breakup. I eventually became isolated &amp; reclusive. I was always a student who would get a decent grade, but after this ordeal, I suddenly felt like nothing mattered anymore. I stopped trying - in everything. My grades suffered drastically. Before this point, not a day passed by when I wouldn't play my guitar for at least an hour each day. Now my guitar rots away in a corner of my room, and I haven't touched it in the last few years. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. I learnt through searching on the internet, that I may be depressed. I told my parents about it, but they just thought I was over-reacting by demanding to visit a psychiatrist. (In India, it's a stigma that only \"mad\" or people with serious mental disorders i.e., social pariahs would only ever need the help of psychiatrists.)For the last several years I've tried to live with this. But Now I feel numb on the inside, and every night, I seem to be asking myself, what's the point of living on? And the only reason I'm alive is coz my parents spent a LOT of money, time and love to raise me, and I can't just kill myself! They deserve better, and I intend to give it to them. But I just can't seem to bring myself to do it. I can't study, I don't have a job (graduated 2 years ago) and most of the time, I can't even get myself to get out of the house for any reason at all. I just lay here, all day... on my bed and surf the internet -- searching endlessly for something that might make me feel better. I honestly believe that I can't do anything right anymore. Before this entire ordeal, I could get extraordinary results in almost anything even if I tried very little. Now, no matter how much I try, I always seem to fail. I can't concentrate or focus. and have no emotional stability. I haven't even approached any girl for dating ever since the breakup. She seems to have left a large gaping hole, an eternal void in my heart that nothing seems to be able to fill. I still try to convince my parents to take me to a shrink -- but they still think I'm over-reacting. Help me, plz. If possible.**I feel like I'm already dead on the inside.**Nothing matters anymore, nothing brings me any pleasure. I fail at anything and everything that I try. I hate my own face, I'm over-weight as fuck and I'm sure my friends find me annoying by now as well. I've gotten pretty good in keeping those suicidal thoughts out of my head, but honestly, I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.. SOrry for this super long rant.

NO.I am not a failure because failures try then try and fail and give up or they try again and again but me? i haven't even tried i already gave up at 22 i don't think i have it in me to change i have always needed a ringmaster in my life not one thing i did where i was in charge and what do when i am in charge? waste. Talking to help lines if pointless they don't really care about mental health here in India.I mean what will she say? I am lazy? I need responsibility? I need to understand the dynamic that no one will hold your hand whatever? I need to experience how hard it really is to earn even a single coin? OR will it be medication till u die lol(it hasn't helped me). My family isn't interested in therapists or psychologists. I am alone and i love it and hate it.TLDR- OP IS A IDIOT LOSER THERE IS NO SOLUTION IN THIS SITUATION OP ALREADY KNOWS WHATS WRONG AND SOLUTION BUT IS A TRUE COWARD AND LOSER.If i look at myself in a technical point of view i am a loser let's see i don't brush, bath, eat properly, play games but don't really master any of them i suck at them all of them i am never even in the top 50 players on a multiplayer game and i usually either play on the easy difficult or cheat engine that shit. But are these really problems Children are forced in slave labour, they have to drink dirty water, stale food and survive a fanatical military, religious maniacs and they still want to live they still want education i know comparison's are wrong this is technical so it's allowed. Will anyone even read this shit? probably not i should have died in my two attempts my first one was a lame cry for help but it didn't work my second was an anger one it was close but meh i think i am better off dead because i actually am dead living like i have read that 5 times and i honestly think the solution doesn't exist my mind is just screwed up too much i am beyond redemption because i don't even seek it even if it's right here free! i am like a doctor specializing in livers who has slight family problems and to combat them drink 6 bottles of alcohol a day.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1402184803.0, "author": "iamkanthalaraghu", "title": "My dad thinks I'm a mistake", "selftext": "This is the worst day of my life, I feel suicidal.

This will be a long post. I'm sorry if this post annoys you in any way.I am an international student from India, and I'm currently pursuing my higher education in San Diego. I got accepted into the bioengineering field, and I was elated because of how lucky I was that I got accepted into a prestigious university for this major. I was planning on going into medicine (i.e take my MCATs around my 3rd year of college). The first 6 months of college was great. I made a lot of friends, I was loved and accepted, I did well in school (got As and Bs). Come third quarter of the year, I suddenly fell into a slump for no apparent reason. I still did relatively well in class, but I found myself skipping classes more often. Friends that I had made just a few months ago left me. Fast forward to the summer, when I took summer session, I found myself truly alone. I did badly, and I put on a lot of weight. I made decisions that I still regret to this day. After summer session, I found myself in my sophomore year. It was also when I met my to-be girlfriend. Things were looking up, I thought. But I found myself unable to get out of bed and unable to go to class. I failed that quarter. I was put on \"prone to academic disqualification\". Things didn't change for the next quarter either. I find myself plying league of legends all day, or watching youtube. I can never seem to be proactive about anything. I cannot make myself go to a therapist. My parents are angry that I'm wasting a $60000 a year opportunity, and they want me to come back home. The university is ready to kick me out of college if I fail my classes this quarter. I haven't told my parents that my university is ready to kick me out of college for fear of abuse. My parents don't understand my situation, and I've been getting into fights with my girlfriend (who incidentally is also the only person I ever talk to in a day. I have no friends). My relationship is slowly going down the drain. I find myself always wanting to cry and do nothing about anything. I miss midterms and quizzes on the regular. I don't want to leave this college. I don't want to leave her either, even after all the shit I put her through. I'm not motivated. I don't even know what I want in life anymore. I am no longer a bioengineering major. My gpa is at 2.2. It doesn't look like I'm ever getting into med school. I'm too much of a coward to even consider killing myself. I am scared of death. But at this rate, I don't know whats going to happen. This post might not be as tragic as anything else on this subreddit, heck it might be nothing compared to what I've read on this page. But I'm getting nowhere. I don't believe in therapy, as the psychologist is going to tell me things that I've heard countless times before. Please help me. I don't know what to do anymore.

I have no motivation or willingness to get a job, I feel like it's just a pointless endeavor that perpetuates a pointless life. I've wasted so much of my parents money.

I live in a society that grows and stubbornly reaches higher for greatness.... and yet I just want to throw it all away. I don't get it... I don't feel like an important character in my own story....

Me dying here only saves them money and heartache of me not living up to my potential in my mind. Yeah, they'll be sad. But time will pass, they'll have less bills in the long run.

I was socially inept and so had a lot of trouble making friends. The \"friends\" I did have beat me up and abandoned me when a girl started to make fun of me, choosing to try to win points with her by mocking me further. I didn't feel like I could do better, however, and so never made a serious effort to find other people.At college, I couldn't tolerate being in such close proximity to so many people all the time. I couldn't study due to a lack of motivation and so ended up wasting my time. I struggled after that between joining the military and finding a job. In the end I decided the latter and became a software engineer.The company I work for gave me an opportunity: transfer to India for a year and lead a small team. I did just that, packing up all my things and leaving; after all, what did I have to lose? When I got there not much seemed to change; I was still alone, only in a new place with six different languages that were all but Martian to me. Through a friend, I had met a woman, an architect, and although we didn't talk much at first, the absence of that friend for a few days sparked something between us. The problem was that I still didn't fully trust her.As disgusting as it sounds, I just wanted to have sex with her. I loved the attention I was getting, and really did enjoy being around her, but the end goal was the same. Eventually she found out my game and we split for a period of a few days, in which time I found how much I really did care for her.Time passed and I struggled to get her to give me another chance. I knew I had done inexcusable things, things that I wouldn't forgive myself, but somehow, she did. She gave me a deal: I had to change the narcissistic parts of myself, the lines of thought that led me to deceive her, and then she would take me back.She told me of her own situation, something which she had not lied about but had not spoken about either. She is married to another man, the ceremony having passed only a few months after I arrived in the country. He was her best friend, but she didn't love him. Only a short while after finishing her Master's degree in England did her parents begin again hounding her to get married. They set up men for her, crazy religious Hindus, as her family is associated with, so her friend offered her a way out. He had feelings for her, and so on a chance she took his hand in marriage.She never felt anything more for him, telling me that they had only kissed once since they had been married before she knew that she couldn't love him. She loved me. And when she said that, and every time since, my heart has swooned. I have struggled to become a better person for her, to support her in any way that I can, but things are going sour.I was working illegally in the country, placed on a Business visa, allowing me only to go to meetings. In reality, I was working 9-5 some days, most days even later. I had to come back to the US while an Employment visa gets processed. My arrival was only weeks before today.The distance has taken a toll on her and I as we try to find time to talk to each other with a 12 hour difference. I stay up late most nights, usually into the early morning in order to have a short conversation with her. On weekends we can video chat, and when we do all those negative feelings wash away. When I can see her smile, I can't help but do the same. But recently I've seen something odd. I message her over FaceBook, and although she is online, she takes hours at a time to respond. When I ask why, she gets defensive. She tells me she loves me to my face but I feel like she's losing whatever feelings she had for me. She puts in no effort to talk to me when it's not convenient for her and tells me I'm not doing enough.When she told me she wanted to end it, I nearly through myself over a cliff (not quite literally yet). I felt angry, sad, confused; I couldn't imagine a life without her! I still can't. I can't fathom her in love with another man, one that I know has been abusive to her. When I think of her following tradition and having kids with a man who neglects and abuses her, a man who used to be her friend, with me being across the world, I don't see any hope for myself.Yes, I realize that there are lots of women in the world and thus there is a high probability for me to find somebody else that I would love equally. But I don't want that. I have the woman I love but she's slipping away. My future is bleak now.I have 10 days to get a rifle. In that buffer time I want to try to enjoy my time on this planet, to treat my parents and siblings well, to love and care for everybody I come in contact with. I want to see if I can find another purpose for living. Before, it was only cash and girls, but after experiencing the warm love of a woman, I can't be that shallow. After feeling that high, I can't live any lower. At the end of those ten days I will pick up the rifle and commit suicide by cop. I hope to see my last sunset on the hills beside my home.

I wanted to comfort myself, but how could I when so much of life has been emptiness? I tried pretending instead. I pretended I'd gone on adventures I never participated in, with friends I'd never had. I pretended I'd been to a party where people knew my name and ladies all wanted to have my number. I pretended I had a pet hedgehog I named Spike Milligan. I pretended I had a girlfriend, who would tell me how her day went, and I would listen as I nodded-off to sleep by her side. I had dreams of walking through woods, learning to make things together, attending festivals in Europe and India together. My only happy memories are lies, and I spent them sotting alone wishing they would come true. I haven't got anyone else to miss me, and I'm tired of this torture. One day I might earn a raise, I would tell myself everyday. One day I might have something left over to buy myself something nice and teach myself a trade. I feel relief at the prospect of leaving.

J's father loses his engineering job and his mother, with an unusable medical degree from India, is forced to take long and sporadic hours at her job nursing.&gt;&gt;J technically lives with his mother, but his mother is never home. Often, she will leave before he wakes up and return from work after falling asleep. This leaves him with massive amounts of time alone and to himself. On one hand, he begins to teach himself things as a distraction and becomes a very proficient programmer as well as being highly skilled in other areas. On the other hand, this marks the beginning of his depression as he begins, for the first time, to hate himself.     2. February 2011&gt;&gt;J and his father go to a restaurant, which is a common occurrence. However, J's father decides that this will be the time to berate J for some reason. J has enough, so he walks out of the restaurant. He walks all the way to the nearest freeway bridge, looking over the edge with dark thoughts again. Eventually, he curls up at the base of the road and calls his father to take him home.&gt;&gt;This is the first time J has considered suicide.        3. September 2009&gt;&gt;J meets B, and he is instantly infatuated. He continues to be attracted to her for four years, and struggles continually with attempting to avoid and get over her.     4. June 2012&gt;&gt;J and his father are both having a bad day. Father is driving J to a school-related event (hours from home), but after some tension, kicks J out of the car at a restaurant. J walks for hours, and when he approaches a freeway bridge, he seriously considers jumping off. &gt;&gt;This is the second time J has come close to suicide.&gt;&gt;After some hours of walking, J arrives near his original destination. He'd injured his leg on the way there, and so he is brought to the hospital and the police are called. His father is *extremely* angry, and berates J further on the way home.    5. November 2012&gt;&gt;J decides after four years of pain that he will ask B out. He expects to be rejected, and for this rejection to be final. This will help him move on.&gt;&gt;B accepts.&gt;&gt;Thus begins their tumultuous relationship.     6. &gt;&gt;J decides after four years of pain that he will ask B out.

I've raped a couple girls while they were passed out drunk, threatened to rape &amp; murder my most recent long-term ex, I've come dangerously close to severely hurting people, I've thrown some random guy through a window into a store, I've had sex with my dogs, I see escorts regularly, I've stolen tens of thousands of dollars of things, and most importantly I've hurt people that I care about for no real reason.  I've manipulated the hell out of people to get what I want, I have 8 ex girlfriends (well 1 ex wife and 7 ex girlfriends) that refuse to talk to me at all.  I have no real friends, at least from my perspective.  A bunch of people that call me a friend, but nobody I specifically want to be around for any length of time, or that I care if I see, ever.  I can lie through my teeth easily, to the point where I have passed a polygraph with flying colors to get government security clearance for a job (the company contracts with the government).  I regularly lie to everyone for no real reason, about the stupidest things, like where I went for lunch or what I did that day.  I can keep it all straight.I'm a genius, and I don't care.  I sailed through one of the best schools in the US, was accepted directly into a doctoral program after my BS degrees, which I didn't accept.  I've had numerous papers published, invented something that cause my school to freely pay off $250,000 in student loans, etc.  I'm now a software engineer, and although I'm amazingly good at my job, I have no motivation whatsoever to do it.  I can get hired in a moment at $150/hr, but over the past few years I've tended to just take contracts, start them, lose motivation and stop working.  The client/boss ends the contract or fires me for not showing up / not working, lather, rinse, repeat.  So I collect $20-$40,000, don't work for a while, do it again.  I burn through money at a ridiculous rate.I've tried everything I can think of.  I've been on various medications for depression, but the problem is that I'm not really depressed.  I've travelled, a lot, and don't really take pleasure in it any more.  It used to at least be interesting to me and now it's \"oh, look: another beach.  And this canyon in Kauai kinda looks like the Grand Canyon.  ok.\"I've been looking for a point for a long time.  I'm \"only\" 31, but I don't really see why I should live another 30-60 years in this state.  In a state of not caring, not wanting to do anything, just... existing.  The way I see it is this: I'm going to die at some point, and within say 40 years after I die, my death won't even be remembered, by anyone.  Even if I really hurt a few people when I kill myself, so what?  They'll be dead soon enough, and their memories and pain will no longer exist.  My life won't matter at all unless I do something important (the funny thing is I'm one of those people that could if I could actually care and get motivation to do so.  I have in the past done things that literally changed entire industries, and got loads of praise and fame for it), I just don't care enough.  But even then, I invented X, or started company Y.  So what?I don't see the point in going forward.  I also don't see the point in killing myself, but over the past 10 years, I've slowly been drifting to the point of ending everything.  Yes, I'm perfectly happy sometimes, but that happiness fades, for me usually very very quickly, into a void.  And other times I'm very depressed, sad, or hurt, and that lingers much longer.  The happiness doesn't make the rest worth it, even in times where the amount of time I'm happy significantly outweighs the amount of time that I'm sad.  It's gotten to the point where I don't want to deal with _any_ pain, even stupid things like being stuck in traffic or cutting my hand on something.Why am I writing this?  Because I want to see a value in something, in anything.  I've done loads of volunteer work, for years.  I've travelled.  I've had people that I've become very close and attached to, that I loved very much.  I'm very active, everything from biking to skiing to triathlons, I go climbing all the time, I guess my point is that I usually don't just sit at home.  But I no longer care about any of it.  And even when I did care, all I remember is caring about the challenge, or in some cases (like rock climbing) the fear, the exhilaration of being on the edge of a rock 1,000 ft above the ground.So the normal: \"talk to someone\" response, I have.  Many people.  I've talked to about a dozen psychologists/psychiatrists, and usually end up getting bored and either messing with them (and consequentially eventually getting asked to leave), or in a couple cases where they were court mandated I just convinced them I was fine.  I've been very honest with a few of them, to which their advice ranged from meditation to anger management to group counseling to drugs to occupying my mind to a dozen other things.  Nothing changes my mindset.  I've been insanely honest with my last girlfriend (who is a psych major), she no longer speaks to me.My current plan is to sell everything I own, go to Thailand for a few months to go climbing mostly, bike through Burma and India, then move to Europe (I live in the US now) indefinitely.  Find somewhere to live and do... whatever.  I'm hoping that completely drowning myself in other cultures might give me another perspective, or ... I don't know, something.  I'm not sure I'll make it to any of that.  I bike over a bridge and stop, and stare at the edge.  I did it a few days ago long enough for someone to call a cop that walked 1 mile to me to see if I was ok.  I go skydiving solo (i.e. non-tandem for anyone that's done it) just to see if I'll pull the cord or not.  Or while rock climbing, I'll think of jumping off a belay ledge.  I've bought enough pills to kill a horse, never took any.  I've owned a gun (which is now somewhere at the bottom of the ocean), I've made several extremely high explosives with the plan to attach them to my head.  They're now at the bottom of a lake (or rather they were used to blow up a log in a lake)...So, I doubt I'll get anything of this, other than some hate mail for a few things that I've said, but it's worth a shot...", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1351084997.0, "author": "sheikhyerbouti", "title": "Angry, upset, and frightened", "selftext": "My current workplace is undergoing a massive \"restructuring\" of sorts - where most of the positions will be either dissolved or moved to India. My girlfriend just received word that her position at her job has been discontinued, but she's being given the \"opportunity\" to choose a different one with more hours, and a greatly reduced rate of pay. I keep hearing how small business owners are \"job creators\" and \"economic contributors\" when the majority of them seem to feel that the mere act of hanging your shingle means that you get acres of cash with little effort or investiture. Most of them feel employing help is an inconvenience, and fewer still have any kind of foresight beyond what will line their pockets in the next quarter.I don't exactly have much faith in humanity - as far as I'm concerned the human race has only just barely evolved ourselves out of lesser simian forms and that we'd still rape and murder each other over a scrap of food.I have been looking for work elsewhere, but without much success. Either the position offered is SEVERELY underpaying (to the point where I would no longer be able to afford common niceties like rent and food) or all of my interviewing with the organization went to prove how much better qualified one of the other candidates is.I'm tired of being chided for holding a pessimistic attitude when it feels like I'm being continually shit on. I've been told that it's when we feel the most abandoned by the divine is when we are actually closest to it - and it's times like these when I feel like it's true, because I feel like I'm being singled out for punishment.Yes, I know the world gets shitty for everyone at certain times and I should be thankful for any kind of employment, even if it leaves me feeling like an abused whore at the end of the day. I'm told I should be grateful that I'm not a refugee in Darfur or living out on the street. I know I'm overlooking all of the myriad little miracles that supposedly help me continue my very existence on this glorious planet, and that life really isn't so bad and if I just chin up and make the best of what I have that things will prove to be a-okay.Well, those \"sunshine and rainbows\" platitudes don't pay the fucking bills. The knowledge that I was incredibly lucky to be born at this particular time and place doesn't impress the collectors on my student loans. The fact that my body is a miracle of biology capable of transforming food and oxygen into life, while staving off disease and being self-healing, doesn't fill my larder or keep electricity flowing to my abode.Feeling happy and optimistic about one's lot in life does fuck-all if you're surrounded by parasites and sociopaths who view you as a \"resource\" instead of a \"human being.\"The more I try to bring some kind of worth to my life, the more the world around me proves that it's not worth shit. I'd kill myself, but given my success rate at everything else currently, I'd probably fuck that up too.My girlfriend loves me and I love her. But I wish that was enough to survive on. The only way I can imagine things improving for either of us depends on a fundamental and miraculous change in the world we live in. It would mean that the world would actually reward hard work and effort; that it would recognize sacrifice; that people would think of the impact their actions have on others, instead of whatever short-term base need currently flits into their head. There is so little I have any effect or control over - and most of the major decisions that affect how I live are in the hands of other people (an employer, prospective or current, for example). Suicide feels like the only form of control I have left right now, and I'm too afraid to even exercise it - I've been proven to be inadequate, incompetent, and just plain unlucky in nearly every other aspect of my life - why would it be and different?I'm not asking for much, I just want to continue to live in a dwelling with the woman I love, and be able to support her as well as she supports me.

I don't think they will anymore. Sadly, I wasted my life away feeling depressed and alone. Especially the past 6 years. It should have been so much better. I'm 24 years old now with no direction in life, and no motivation to improve. I think about suicide every day. This is long, so sorry about that. If you're interested, here is my story.My relationship with my parents growing up was not good. My father had a very bad temper and his verbal and at times physical abuse at an early age was traumatic to me. My mom was luckily there to intervene a lot of times, but she also has a lot of the same views as him which didn't gel with who I was as a teenager.They are both doctors, from India. There was a lot of pressure to perform well academically, get into a good college, and major in either medicine or engineering, something professional that would lead to a good paying, prestigious career. My father was obsessed about me doing well on the SAT exams, and didn't give me any choice in the matter of what to study in college or where I would go. He based this decision purely on what his sister-in-law (a HS guidance counselor) recommended.The main thing I was really interested in growing up was music. I loved the energy and excitement I got when listening to music, and started playing guitar when I was 12. I spent a lot of time teaching myself to play when I was growing up, and I got good at it, and felt that I could grow up to be really good at it. I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue, but when time came to talk about what I would do in college, he said \"absolutely not music\". He doesn't give any value to music and would belittle me about this thing that I cared so much about. \"How much money have you made playing guitar? You think you're so great?\" He really beat me down about it and made me feel worthless. Fine. I would go to college to study what he wanted me to study, engineering.  At least I would be away from him, right?My first year of college sucked. I was in a small, heavily monitored freshman dorm, surrounded by assholes who bullied me (who would do stuff like take a hat I was wearing, run off with it and light it on fire), and studying engineering, which really didn't appeal to me. I only had 1 friend who would regularly hang out with me. On my 19th birthday, in February, I was so depressed from all the bullshit these assholes were putting me through that I smoked pot in my room rather than going outside, and got in trouble for that. I knew there was a good chance I'd get in trouble, but I didn't care.I saw a therapist for a few times after that because I told the school I was depressed. And that was helpful. I ended up doing a lot better for the rest of the school year. Made good friends towards the end who also were into skateboarding, art, and music and generally seemed like the cool hippie kids I wanted to know the whole time. Things were looking up, I was going to live with a friend who was awesome, and finally be happy, right?Then during summer vacation, I had gotten accepted into another school closer to home, which I had applied to transfer into around the time that I got caught smoking weed. I gave it some thought (not enough though) and decided to transfer. Why? Too many bad memories. Thought I'd benefit from a fresh start. This is a major regret in retrospect. I lost a lot of really special friends that I never had a chance to have real solid friendships with. I think part of me wanted to leave because I thought they'd be happier without my awkward presence… which is sad to think about because I now know it would have been fine. They really did like and care about me.I started sophomore year at a new school. I changed my major from engineering to economics. I never enjoyed economics, but I thought I could get through it and it would be enough of a 'practical major' for my father. I don't even think I brought up studying music because I knew how he'd react, as he was already butthurt that I quit engineering. So it was a compromise for the sake of my father, again. I should have made a better switch than to fucking economics though, since I never wanted a cubicle job and I never cared about stocks or anything like that. I never met people in my classes that I got along with. I made friends through my initial living situation who remained my friends throughout college, but I always felt like an outsider. I was always the one calling someone else to hang out, never the other way around. Going to parties wasn't great because when asked \"what's your major?\" and then saying that it's economics and I don't like it doesn't make you a fun person to talk to. The interaction often ended there. Super lame. So I never fit in. I never had a good, fun, living situation in college, spent the last year alone. Never got laid at all the whole time in high school, college, or since then either. Never felt the warm embrace of a girl. Never loved by anyone.After college, I eventually got a shitty internship that lasted almost a year, mostly just entering data on a computer for $9/hr. Living in a condo with my brother, paid for by my parents, in a part of the city that I never wanted to be in, away from my friends and surrounded by people that I can't relate to. I was in a band though, so that was good. I hung out with them a lot and for the first time I was putting the time and work into music that I wanted to, rather than just noodling alone in my room. It was fun.This past winter though, I decided I needed a change, the job was boring as ever and the band was slowing down… So I moved across the country to live/work in the mountains. I had a great time there overall, snowboarding every chance I could. Had good friends and roommates. Didn't make much money though due to a slow winter/lack of work and instead of keeping the adventure going, I came home in May.Things were initially good when I came back. One thing that was nice was that I finally looked like I wanted to, more or less. I've always been really thin, but I put on a little weight, and the face was looking good. Also, I finally had the nice long hair I always wanted to have growing up, instead of a 'bullshit phase' messy afro type thing I'd usually have… since my dad would always make me cut it off. About 2 weeks after I came back, I went to a party after some friends of mine played a concert and things seemed to be going well that night. There was even a cute girl who I think was interested in me. Unfortunately, I drank a lot that night. I don't remember exactly what caused it, it could have been a few different things, maybe overall sadness upon reflecting on my own college experience and/or the need to go to sleep. Anyway, I got really upset and decided to leave the party. It was really childish. I got my longboard and tried to skate all the way home… several miles away in the middle of the night. Yes, I should have stayed/taken a cab. Instead, I fell hard and hurt my face. It looked bad initially, deep cut below my eye and scrapes on my forehead, but It could have been much worse. I was a couple millimeters away from probably losing my eye. Now I have a small dark scar under my eyelash which I've come to hate, especially given how I got it. That event catapulted me into a really deep depression. I was planning on starting to work a restaurant job the next day, had to call that off. I stayed at home with my parents for 2 weeks while my face recovered.I came back to living with my brother and was getting more and more depressed. Thinking about suicide constantly while pacing around the room, barely eating, looking at the mirror. To the point where I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I wrote a letter to my parents basically telling them I'm close to ending my life and why I felt this way. My dad called the next night while I was at a friends house to yell at me… told me you're coming home tomorrow, and you're gonna cut your hair (of course). So the next day, I came home, my mom gave me a shitty haircut, my dad yelled at me some more, and my mom tried to comfort me. At this point I felt inconsolable. There is nothing that I felt would be worth it to live for. I got admitted into an inpatient psych ward for 5 days in June, then an outpatient program for a few weeks. I thought I was feeling better. I had a plan to go back to college to pursue music therapy and told the people at the program that, which they thought sounds good, but I don't really know if that's what I want to do....To be honest, I still feel like ending my life just as much as I did in the beginning of the summer. I've thought for years that I'd kill myself around this age.. I'm not doing anything productive these days. Can't find a job. Still barely eating. I'm addicted to masturbating, too. I sometimes waste hours a day doing that.  Seeing other people being happy makes me more depressed. My friends in college who are living exactly how I wanted to live. I could have thrived if I had that opportunity. I feel like every time I hang out with someone I say/do something really dumb that I beat myself up over, especially since if I do kill myself, they'll inevitably be thinking/talking about me and the stupid things I've said/done. So many people have embarrassing stories about me. I feel embarrassed about how I've lived these last 6 years… this was supposed to have been the prime time of my life, what have I accomplished? My mother cares about me a great deal but after all that we've been through, I still feel the same- hopeless. I feel bad to keep putting her through this torture. My dad doesn't even speak to me directly anymore, he says \"he's your problem\" to my mom. He's a big reason in why I've ended up like this. If there's anyone that I'd be happy to hurt emotionally by killing myself, it's him.", "is_suicide": 1}, {"created": 1337911139.0, "author": "ingenioutor", "title": "My brother just committed suicide", "selftext": "SQLwitch asked me to post here.

Three hours later I missed a bunch of calls from him. After calling him back he started telling me how much he loved me. He was clearly drunk. He apologized for a bunch of things and asked me to tell him a good memory of us. He also asked why i didnt call him more often. I was busy driving so I said I'd call him in 5 mins. I did but he didn't answer any of my calls. I thought he went to sleep or something. This morning my parents called to come home ASAP. He committed suicide.I don't really know how to deal with this.

From the outside, my life appears great.  I just finished graduate school and my university is offering me a great fellowship to convince me back for a PhD.  I have a couple friends who I love dearly and who love me back.  Despite not having a good homelife or family, I am lucky to have an older mentor who is like a parents to me, who, despite us having no blood relationship, has treated me with unconditional caring.And then there is Islam.  There is no reason to fuck with long stories and jjustifications about why.  I just, stopped believing, slowly.  And that has cost me everything.  My fiance left me over it, because my disbelief was too much to bear.   I also found out some things which made me mad, one of them being that he cheated on me recently before leaving.I forgave the cheating, and I was not mad about anything.  I know reddit hates religious people, but I understood him.  He wants a religious wife and that's fine because its his life.  I moved on, I got over wanting to die, and I convinced myself life would be ok.  I began applying for a bunch of PhD programs.  I made plans on where to go, I made plans on how to spend the next years of my life.  I had found some happiness.Then last night, at 4 am, he calls me.  He wants to be with me.  He begs me.  He is sorry for the cheating. That much I know he is sorry.  Fuck the people who say, once a cheater, always a cheater... this situation with his cheating is complicated, and, even though I sound like an idiot, I do believe his sorrow on this and I do forgive him. He cries on the phone and tells me he might kill himself.  Yes, you will all right this off as abusive or manipulative, but, can you honestly tell me you've never done anything in your life.  He tells me to his biggest shock that he's told his family about me.  How pathetic right?  5 years together, \"married\" in secret, and his family had no idea about me.  Seems werid to you, but, that's how Indians are.  No one in his entire family has had a love marriage.  He has 33 cousins and not one of them has done it.  He had been terrified of his family.   He said when he told his dad, he had to listen to his dad cry on the phone.  He has likely ruined his relationship with his parents which, although that doesn't seem like a huge deal to a lot of Americans, you can't fathom how important this relationship is to an Indian.  (I don't say that to say \"you Americans don't love your parents!\" so don't take it that way, I just mean, this dynamic in India is something that is hard to even explain)So he says his conditions.  If I am with him, I must wear the hijab again.  I have to want to learn Islam with him and try and get better.  He cried on the phone asking me why I don't want to try.  I love this man more than my life.  If only he understood what it is to loose faith.  How I wish he understood it.  I love this man, and would give him anything, and he would give me anything, and he loves me unconditionally, but religion tells me he is not allowed to be with an unbeliving woman.  And he can not go against religion.He kept calling asking me to give a decision if I am willing to work things out with him, finally he called me again tonight 3 am, I told him, I will tell you by the end of the day.Now there is another problem.  I mentioned my friend and my mentor.  They are important because all the Muslim friends have left when I stopped caring for Islam.  Only these two exsist and they are both Hindus.  I love and respect these two (my friend and mentor) so much.  They have no idea.   They dislike my fiance for many reasons, and my mentor in particular at this point hates him because he found out about the cheating.  If they find out I go back to my fiance, they will loose every respect for me and I don't think they can ever love or care for me after this.  This hurts more than I can describe.  Especially they were so proud I was on my own, being my own person, so happy at me. Even my fiance hates them.  I wish these three did not hate each other.  These three people I care so much about.No matter what I do someone is unhappy.  My fiance's life is destroyed if I leave him.  He doesn't understand my lack of faith.  No one understands it.  I want to go and try things with him but if I do my mentor and friend will loose all respect and hate me.  I stand to loose all people I care about.  Also if I chose not to go back, it is now on me.  At least before, when he broke up with me, I could live with it knowing it was not my decision, I was powerless to change it, so I accepted and moved on.  To be honest, I can not make the decision to throw out the memories, the love, I can not communicate the depths of our love.I made a decision while on the phone with him, that I might end it today.  Call me a coward, I am a coward.  I can not make this decision.  I can not be in this place.  The pain I have felt over these things I can not describe.  I can not face this and I don't want to.  I told him I wlil make a decision today but I am not sure I will return today.  Sorry this is not very readable.  I am so distraught.", "is_suicide": 1}]
