Myself, am 28M from India. I am asking this question for one of my known friend who is 32F.One of my known women who is 32F, got married at the age of 22 and lost her husband after five years of marriage by the time she has 4 year old daughter. Now her daughter is of around 12 years of old (Not sure exact age). Since couple of years she is suffering from depression. and also she consulted doctor as well. But she says she feels head ache most of the time. I observed she always in  busy thinking of something, can you call that as overthinking? She says she is worried of her daughter future and career. I know, how depression feels like, i was also depressed at some point of my life in past and overcame by consulting doctors and social media platform friends like reddit. But, she is mostly illiterate, so she cannot be on social media and find the solution from the people out here.At some point, i just wonder is she depressed because she is lonely in her life and missing partner in her life. Is it because she deprived from her sex life ( I am sure she never had her sex in last 5 to 8 years approximately). She is in the condition and in such place that she is monitored by her by family members 24 hours of her day. Having relationship with any men out there is out of her choice and can never be possible. Please leave your comment below, so that how can i help her. ( Exclude your option of solution where she can remarry or having with relationship with other men outside, that can never be possible)Thanks for reading.Please reply with your serious answers. Thanks lot.","3":"Hi Guys, I am from Delhi, India and a disciple of Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar.It's my first post here and its my honest experience of how I overcome anxiety\/depression and hope it benefits many others like me. Even if even a single person here benefits from the methods listed, I will consider my efforts are not gone in waste. If you or your near ones are struggling with depression please read this post till end and suggest them the methods I have shared, you might save someone precious to you. So friends, In December of year 2018, one of my best friends who returned from a vacation and was staying in hotel called me around 1 AM in the morning. He consumed alcohol that night and then consumed medicines for fever and he was almost collapsed. I immediately reached his hotel with my brother, put him in my car in unconscious state and rushed to the nearest hospital. Doctors told me he's having heart-attack, did what they could best but couldn't save him.He died right in front of me, my best friend died and I couldn't do anything, didn't drop a single tear that night.Subsequent few months, every night I would get nightmare of what happened that night. Every night whatever happened to my friend would roll over in front of my eyes like a movie,  gradually I started blaming myself of not saving him. Before this incident I would almost sleep immediately after falling on bed but now things were opposite.It continued for few months, and suddenly one day I felt wires in my brain are all mixing up, I would stare at a single object for hours, didn't have any attention on anything and was having suicidal tendencies. Things got worse and I was feeling I am turning mad, I felt I am unable to breathe properly, started getting palpations, my heart would at times pound so fast I could hear it clearly. Blood pressure level and pulses readings suddenly would go very low. I knew something is happening to me. If any of you guys experienced these symptoms you know what I mean and how painful they are. I took medical help, had a few checkups and docs concluded I'm in depression. The only cure modern science offers is to give anti-depressants. Deep inside I knew taking these pills is not the remedy, it will shut the mind and make me sleep and make me more dull, when I would wake up next morning same routine will follow. I decided not to take those anti-depressants.So what's the solution, how did I overcame this... Guys what I am going to describe worked like magic to me.In year 2015, I had done Art of Living foundation's **\"Happiness Program\"**, Its a 3-4 days 2 hrs.\/day program, where they teach you a technique called \"**Sudarshan Kriya\"**. Its a very very powerful breathing technique which is immensely helpful in keeping the stress hormones out of your system. Once you learn the the Kriya, you have to do it every day, takes around 30 minutes and makes you physically, mentally and spiritually uplifted. Well I learned Sudarshan Kriya and was very happy with it, but due to busy schedule and corporate life, stopped doing it completely after few months. I thought maybe Sudarshan Kriya can help me but It was almost 3.5 years and I completely forgot how to do it. I contacted an Art of Living teachers and again learnt it, started doing it and believe me from day one it did wonders. I felt like I control my mind, things started improving. My Art of Living teacher suggested me to do the next level of program that's called **\"Advance Meditation Program\"**. Its a 4 days program where they teach yoga and meditations.Next week, I took that course and believe me that gave me the actual relief. Few weeks passed and things started improving automatically, sleep got much much better. Now I hardly get memories of that incidence. The series of meditations they teach at the course help you erase past impressions and your mind becomes like an empty slate. Friends, words are less to describe the \"Advance Meditation Program\" and its effects, it works like a magic.I know all this would sound like foolish, don't trust me but read about the research done on Sudarshan Kriya and its effects and you would have some idea how powerful it is. I wish every one fighting the depression to learn the Sudarshan Kriya and do the Advance Meditations Program. After COVID-19, for the benefit of society, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar has blessed these to be taken online so you can do it courses  also.**You can find the details on courses here:** [**https:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/in-en**](https:\/\/www.artofliving.org\/in-en)If you have done the courses and it helped you, please share your experiences here for the benefit of society.Stay happy, stay blessed, lets meditate.**Jai Gurudev....**","4":"In the last few months of my elementary school in the US, my parents suddenly told me that we were going to move to India. For a 10-year-old, I was kind of OK with it, I didn't think I would lose out on a lot. But I did. When I was in elementary, I had grades that were above 98%, I was in the accelerated studies and the school was thinking I could skip a grade if I worked harder. I even had a group of 8 tight-knit friends that were always with me. I also had a lot of hobbies like painting, robotics and swimming. Life was much simpler and easy back then. However, when I moved, I didn't get a break before I started school in India. It's because school starts on June 1, so I had no time to get used to the new place. After a year, I realized that there was a serious dip in my life. I was now barely passing my studies, I had 1 or 2 somewhat friends. I couldn't get the same feeling for doing the things I used to once love. And my dad was still behind in the US because of his job.  When I told my parents about this, they told me that it was my problem and that if I had stayed there it would have been the same. I started to get more and more anti-social. I couldn't urge myself to start a conversation with others, even though I had been a great public speaker before. I finally found something to cope with and it was gaming. Unfortunately, coming from an Asian family, they hated it when I gamed. They deleted all my games and when 2020 rolled over, I felt like my life hit rock-bottom. I just didn't want to live. My parents kept on scolding me for getting bad grades but I couldn't do it, even after so much studying. Now, I'm nearing the end of my high school and I don't know what to do for my future. I hate myself so much that I made a plan when I am going to kill myself. The plan is for me to spend the last 2 years studying the hell out for my final exams and once I finish it, I'm going to commit suicide. If I were to tell my 9-year-old self that this was going to be the rest of my childhood, I would have told myself that this was a stupid thought that would never happen. And yet it is...","5":"I'm fully aware of the fact that I'm not the only one facing this situation at the moment, but that doesn't seem to make it any better for me. I mean, seriously, what do I do?Sometimes I go out to play cricket or football with my friends, but that's only for a few hours, a couple days in a week. Sometimes I play the guitar, but I'm not good at it, and I've been playing the same crap over and over again. Other than that I'm on my phone, all the time with the exception of meals and going to the washroom. I have three people in my family - my mom, grandma, and me (I live in India, and staying with your mom at or over 18 years of age is fully acceptable here). My relationship with my mom isn't that great, and conversions with grandma seem so one sided.I have this friend of mine with whom I talk all day on telegram. Well, tbh, we send stickers to each other more than we talk. Other than her I don't have a proper friend. The others are more like soccer buddies, that's all we do together.I was supposed to go to college this year. Enter corona, boom!I've watched so many videos of our college in YouTube, and I was so damn excited to go there. But here I am, letting online classes run in the background, my camera and microphone turned off. I think of getting a new hobby, but I don't know what. Like I said, I play the guitar but I'm not very good at it. I do not have the patience to read books. I almost never finish watching the TV shows I start. I can't think of doing anything productive...either that, or I just don't want to.Thank you for reading.Farewell.","6":"HI I'M 21 YO MALE AND LOOKING FOR ROOM PARTNER MAINLY A FRIEND I'M SICK OF BEING IN MY HOME I'VE BEEN DEPRESSEDAND MENTALLY TIRED OF MY SURROUNDING ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MOVE OUT WITH ME MALE FEMALE DOESN'T MATTER .","7":"so i just got my exams time table today, and since then I can't get it out of my head. I can understand that worrying about academics should not be considered depression exactly, but the fact that I'm worthless piece of shit brought me here. I usually am a wannabe funny guy who has really cool internet friends, but sometimes I think they talk to me just bcoz they feel bad for me. Its not like I'm an introvert or something but socializing doesn't feel like how it used to feel. I live in a small apartment with my parents, who are very strict and they expect too much from me, but I don't think i can live upto that. I see people my age doing so well in everything or atleast something, and I'm here just wondering when will I die. Sometimes i think my parents don't deserve me but then again its me who's always causing problems. I have literally no interest in anything and since I'm their only child, they keep on expecting too much from me. During this pandemic, if i could've studied a little, i think I might've been better than what I am now. Cuz right now ,here in India its the only thing that matters. Sometimes I hate the way my parents treat me, i just want to move out but then again, its India. I used to like gaming as a way to escape reality until my dad sold my PC. Everyday I wake up hoping that i would change but then i just keep on disappointing myself and everyone around me. I hate myself for everything I do.Sometimes I can't bare to stay with my parents so I go out in this 'gaming cafe', where i spend my saved up money to play this stupid games. I know its wrong to blame my parents, I can understand but they're too much sometimes. My mom is kindof dying, she has Parkinson's and my dad isn't that good of a person. He has a low salary job but he's not home most of the times. I feel terrible seeing my like this and I can't do anything about it, she hates me because I'm not much great of a son. I have some friends irl too but I don't like to bother them. Everyone has their own stuff to handle. I see people in relationships, hanging out together, having fun with their siblings, making their parents proud, which makes me hate everyone around me including myself. I barely even passed 11th grade and I think I'm nothing and even if I try to convince myself that I'm something I can't. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of being lonely, I'm tired of being nothing but a disappointment to my parents, I'm tired of being myself.","8":"Greetings!

My internship year didn't go well as I imagined. My mental health issues started around April last year. I had very good support from my friends. They took me to psychiatrist in our hospital and treatment was started. They did whatever they can to cheer me up. Even after treatment i couldn't sleep for many days. One day one of my  friend met with accident. I couldn't handle that. And I had not slept for 5 days even after taking tablets ( prescribed by my doctor). That day I had to sleep anyhow, I took 5 sleeping tablets and 8-9 anxiety tablets at once just to sleep without any other intention. I knew that dose is not fatal. I texted my friends before taking that I had to sleep, I can't handle this situation, I m not getting sleep even after taking 2 tablets, so I'm doubling my dose . Next day they informed my parents and sent me home for one month. That was the last time I talked with my best friend. He never talked to me when I came back from home. I don't know the reason. I cried, begged to tell atleast the reason for doing like this for me. But still I never gave up. I took my medication, exercised, whenever I had a had day I used to double duty in hospital (That's the only thing that I enjoyed and diverted my mind). I slowly recovered and my treatment was tapered and stopped last month. As I recovered I lost my other friends too. I don't know the reason even why they did like that. I miss my friends and my bestfriend daily. I have frequent breakdown whenever I see him. I blame everything on me. I have done some terrible thing that they left me.I don't know how to handle this situation. I have come here after I lost everyone who can understand me. And I don't want to go to that sabe phase again.","10":"Anyone who knows me will tell you that travelling is what I live for\u2026it\u2019s been my passion, since I was 2 years old (yes, that young!) visiting over 40 countries since coming into this world.

Although our household isnt really indian, but a lot of things would be uncommon elsewhere i guess. So anyway, since i was really young, my brother would beat me a lot, not exactly in an angry way, but he would basically choke me, beat me, scratch me in the name of fun, and i would just cry and do nothing i guess lol. what else was i supposed to do? He was 9 and i was like 3. But the choking began later like when i was 5 or 7 or something but yeah. My mom and dad would see this, and usually just dont care. There is more, but ill get on to that later.My dad. He is probably the best out of all the 3, but i still dislike him, like, i would be sad if he died, but mostly cause of money and stuff ngl. But even if money wasnt an issue, i would still be sort of sad. But yeah. He has an addiction to tobacco, not smoking, but the one where you chew and spit it out idk im not well versed in this area. He is mostly problematic, because he just doesnt care, he used to, but now he doesnt. He just screams when there is an issue and goes back.My mom. She is an actual piece of shit. I dislike her the most. She is so hypocritical, so abusive, i dont even wanna talk about it. She is the one who teaches me, and i would get good marks. Ok ill get onto the main deal now that the characters have been set lol.I was born with a dark skin tone, and i was ugly. I mean, i still am lol. I dont remember much of my life before i was 4, and i dont remember much about my life till like 6, but i still rmember it somewhat. So, i was made fun of for my skin colour, not as a racist way, but i was called black insultingly in hindi as a way of teasing. I was called ugly, and i became pretty self aware at a very young age. My method to deal with this? To act like i dont care about my looks at all. Whereas in reality, i did. I knew from a young age that my looks were a bad first impression, and i could do nothing about it. This isnt even my greatest problem, but might as well start here. Ok, so second thing. I am really emotionally sensitive. now this is not really a thing i can explain properly, like, i wont get mad if a guy on the internet calls me stupid, its moreso when a friend does, or someone i care about, and when its front of some people and they laugh or something. So from a young age, i was made fun of for my skin colour, i would cry, i was made fun of for being a crybaby, i cried(lol). Then, eventually shit happens, and i wasnt sensitive enough to cry everytime, but i would cry over emotional things still. And that is still present.This is mostly everything that has led to my ruin, oh wait, more things lol.I \\*think\\* I have anxiety, i sweat whenever my teacher calls on me, no matter how much i know the teacher. And i also have a sweating problem lol but that doesnt really matter. But my heart beats faster, i get really nervous etc. Same thing when im talking to someone popular or someone i had never talked to etc. Its just not good. Also i have this thing, where i think, like, a lot. I literally fall deep into random thoughts jumping from one topic to another with a very weak link between them. I also talk to myself, talk about shit as though if i were a youtuber or something. This might be ADHD but idk. ok so that should be everything but i might add more info as i go alongHopefully, that covers all the prerequisites to understand my situation and make a based judgement.So, i was born in 2005. I have basically no memories up until 3 so skip. So, what i can remember is, my brother would beat me, my mom was very strict, she would beat me if i lost an eraser or a pencil, she would beat me if i was late, even by a minute for studying( I study according to a time table), and for various other tiny things. She would also beat me when i got hurt while playing, which is just..... ok. My mom was a sorta teacher, has a degree in maths. She takes tuitions at home, like extra stuff to help students.( and im ngl she is good at it even though her morals are pretty messed up). Ok so my dad was pretty nice back then, he was nice, would protect me from my mom, my brother and would basically give into buying what i wanted most of the times. As i grew older, the situation changed of course. My brother started doing more crazy shit, like choking and stuff, my mom and dad started caring less and less. My brother was hella smart about it. There would basically be no scratch marks or any sort of visible signs of injury. Whereas while trying to escape, i would scratch him a lot and whenever i would complain, he would scream about that. He has a liking for power. My mom knows that he beat me, but would think that i did pretty much worse to him, and i would get beat. OH FUCK, i remember! Up until i was like 11, my mom would beat me when we i screamed for help while fighting. Bruh. But yeah a lot of her actions didnt make sense whatsoever. My dad was the same as he was up until i was like 11 or 12 i dont quite remember but yeah. I diagnosed myself with depression (lol) as i was sad all the time, at like 10 maybe? and the online quizzes seemed to prove it although they were pretty fking generic ngl. So yeah. As i entered into my double digits age, i found myself being worse day by day. But before i continue, here is another factor! lol life isnt that linear i just have to say all of this if i want help lol.So, my mom taught me. In jr kg(Kindergarten) i got like 60 or 70 percent or something. oh yeah btw we measure in percent and not grades so keep that in mind. In sr kg i got like 85, and in 1st standard i got 90. Also grade=standard. Those numbers kept going up until 4th, where i peaked with 99 in my second to last exam then went to 96 for my finals.. From 5th standard they sorta floated at 92-93 for a while. In 7th, for the first time in a while, I got 89. I got below 90. I was devastated and my parents, obviously judging me only based on my marks, scolded me. Then in 8th.... oh boy...... i really dont want to talk about this year. The shit i did in school was deplorable to say the lease. But this is about my parents so i think i can safely avoid it. If you are curious, just... dont. Its not something like murder lol. its legal but its embarrassing as hell. But, in 8th i dropped below 90 pretty permanently, and i got a grand total of 79 percent which was just sad. I then went up back to 89.8 in 9th and now im in 10th with 90 and 89.9 percent for my 1st and 2nd exam. So yeah, just know that, the validity of my statements are measured with my marks being an aspect.Also, after like 11 yrs old, or 6th standard, my parents dropped the beating basically. but it still happened.Ok so now, this is going to be a mess, i have laid out everything you need to know, now im bout to go all outMy mom is a piece of actual fucking dogshit. She is so fking abusive. She knows that im emotionally sensitive and takes full advantage of that. She has this look that she uses which basically makes me feel guilty as fuck. She uses it to and a bunch of other sayings, like \"do you have any shame?\" \"Why dont you go die\" \" This is why your marks have dropped\" and various other things that i cant quite translate without losing its meaning. She uses these sayings to make me study longer(its so stupid cause i wont fking study if she makes me sit for longer. Ill just look at the book and be lost in my thoughts) and to make me do shit, like bring her glasses. She uses this in petty arguements and hugely guilt trips me. I dont remember exactly whats wrong right now as my mind is blurred with my bro and my dad so yeah. But my mom is my biggest problem, ill hopefully edit that in. But i think ill get bored or somethingMy brother is also a person whom i thoroughly dislike. He beats me a lot, makes jokes and acts as a friend, but when we get into a fight, not a physical one, but one where we are just screaming, he says so many things which are just plain wrong. E.g. on new years, he wanted to order pizza. I am extremely scared of covid and i honestly just dont want to take any chances. LIke i know the chances are pretty low, but just why risk it? Why does it matter? Its just pizza. Losing convenience isnt a big deal. So we broke into a fight, and i said no lol. So he called me a scaredy cat, there are no better ways to put it. Its a lot more aggressive and shit but thats essentially what he said. He said that if i grow up like this and go to a hostel in college, i will be bullied hard( which imma be honest, i am very well aware of it. I just cant do anything about it like, what can i do about anxiety and social awkwardness if there is no one to help me?) But it had nothing to do with this, like, I was scared of a fucking life taking virus, and just because you want some pizza doesnt mean ill risk my life, no matter how small the chances. I know its slim, but i honestly wish it wasnt like this. If he ordered pizza and only he got the virus, i would be glad to let him. But obviously itll spread to me, thats what i care about. And then, my mom said that a person who is very close to us(not to me. I literally have no one i care about. Maybe my 2 best friends but not even that much) is gonna come back to our city, as she had married and now lived in a different state. And there is actually just no excuse for that. You cannot tell me that a person who fucking travelled through 5 states or so in a train (check out indian trains lol. They are hella crowded) is safe. He wants to look cool and say a lot of dialogues, so he said \" She will come here no matter what\". I lost my shit. I started beating him, he beat me, we went toe to toe until we just stopped after like 10 seconds. He screamed at me, as i was literally not able to talk because i was gasping so much while talking, which happens pretty often, and he got a few statements about me being a piece of garbage and so on. Then today, ah yes, the fateful day. So, he has had the laptop 24\/7 for a year now, and i could only take while he was asleep, and had to give it back to him whenever he woke up. Because he was 'studying'. which tbf he was, but not all the time. He was only studying 50 percent of the time. He jus watched videos in the meantime, which he could have done on his phone(which was also mine which he took because he broke his but, i dont rlly care about it since i just watched youtube on my mom or dads phone instead). He would literally wake up while i was taking the laptop, just so that i couldnt take it. I remember i took it for my classes because he was asleep, he literally saw me taking it, woke up, and took it back. Then later when i saw the history he was fking watching videos. That made me mad. Just know that i cried for a lot of these incidents lol. So, today, his studying is over, he was watching videos on his laptop, and i wanted it, because now he isnt 'studying'. And you know what happens? Ok ive started crying now lol. But yeah lets get on to the incident which sparked me to write this. I knoked on the door. He didnt answer. I knocked again and again and he refused to open. I started crying. My mom was telling him to give it to me. He didnt open the door. After like 5 mins of aggressive knocking he opens the door. He stands there looking dominant and says \"what?\". i ask for the laptop and he refuses. I burst in and just try to take it. He pushes me around. I struggle back. I take it in my hand. He threatens me. I refuse to keep it down. He then says such shit that im on the verge of going back in his room rn and stabbing him. See the thing is, Im not mad because he didnt give me the laptop. I mean i am, but that isnt what makes me cry so much. Its his lies. He says he was studying for a while, and he was just watching videos for like half an hour.(of course, he didnt have that book there 15 mins ago when i checked, and he shut the lights and closed the door 10 mins ago.) I dont care. I just wanted to kill him and myself. I ask him, why he didnt open the door then? his answer? \"Why am i obliged to answer you?\" Not even in our language but in english. Pissed me off so much. \"why am i obliged to answer you?\" huh? Im not a brother, im not a family member, just some random guy knocking on the door right? im not someone who said 15 mins ago that i will take the laptop in 15 mins huh? I wasnt the guy who didnt cry for the laptop for a whole year huh? And you know what he else he says during this shit? \" I just wanted to watch some videos for half an hour and then i would go to sleep. \"Couldnt you just wait? Didnt i wait for you when you had the laptop?\" OH WHAT A NOBLE FUCKING DEED YOU DID YOU AABSOLUETE PIECE OF HUMAN SCUM. YOU WAITED FOR 15 MINS ONCE WHEN YOU DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO STUDY FOR ME TO FINISH MY GAME OH WHAT A NOBLE KING YOU ARE! HOW STUPID AM I TO NOT WAIT HALF AN HOUR FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR VIDEOS WHICH YOU COULD WATCH ON YOUR FUCKING PHONE RiGHT????? alright now that i ranted, let me break down what is wrong with the statement. First off, it was videos which he could watch on his phone. He has taken the laptop from me for this exact reason. Second off, he has given me the laptop for an extra 15 mins like thrice maybe. Third off, he has scolded me for making him wait. Fourth off, he wasnt opening the fucking door. How would i know that he was watching only for 30 mins? Do you know something worse? he did this just for show. Just to seem right in frony of me and my parents. He was laughing when i was screaming at him to open the door. He was laughing up until he opened the door. OK then, he closed the door, i said i would beat him, he said jsut touch me, i pushed him and he almost fell, he slapped me and i almost got knocked out. My dad comes in, hears our arguement, and yknow what he does? Scold me for sleeping at 1 30 am. Wha? I have been doing that for literal fucking years. I am only 15 and I HAVE BEEN DOING GTHAT FOR YEARSSSSSS. Then i lose my shit yet again and scream, make a bunch of valid arguments which im jsut not about to write here ok? im tired bro. Then my bro chimes in and says that im making too many dialogues for my age(ah yes, my age. Just because im 15 means my feelings and opinions arent valid anymore, totally agree) Then he goes into his room and i go to my dad and tell him what actually happened. Of course he cuts me off in the middle, and brings up the sleeping late thing again( Note that i was crying so hard that i was gasping every single time i said a word). I make an analogy to his tobacco addiction he gets mad. He asks rhetorically \" whats your age?\" . I literally(no like literally) threw my hands in the air and was about to go. He didnt let me, i said a bit more, my bro came in, and i was like \"of course now this guy will come in this argumnet, support my parents and make me have a bad time\". He then says go and take the laptop cause it was better than listening to you. OK. I took it. And here i am. Writing a reddit post instead of playing games. I wanna die. Help me. my brother isnt even my problem here man, its my mom. I just dont want to expend my energy on writing. Im tireddd. I might edit it in if it gets enough traction. Ill also post this on depression and depression help. If, like, i get 1 reply only, and that reply is like \" Idk man, go see a therapist\" i stg. ok. thats about it. ill play minecraft because i only have 30 mins of play time as i spent 1 and a half hour writing this post wooooooooooooooooooooo","13":"I'm 25 years old. Have been with a gorgeous, wonderful loving girlfriend for 8 years. Have a family that's proud of me. Started a company with a friend and am making more money than would be reasonable at my age. I have accomplished multiple life goals I had. And since the world would be better without me, I am considering suicide. Feel free to skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you don't feel like hearing my story.I went to get psychiatric help not too long ago for anxiety. After being diagnosed with depression and redirected to the psychologist, I started going through therapy to understand the origin of my emotions. Essentially I'm a piece of shit manipulator. Grew up without a dad. My mom always knew how to make everyone do what she wanted, playing with their emotions and guilt, and I hated her for it. Now I see I'm probably worse.When I met my girlfriend she was dating another guy. She was really in love. But I wanted her, so I became her friend, got close, got her to break up with him and started dating her. Not once I considered anything I did wrong. She lost her parents recently and after a few days of being torn down, I was already tired of hearing her cry. It just bored me. I supported and comforted her, but I was screaming inside \"when will you get over it?!\". I now realize... She deserves someone better. And won't find him while she is with me. I'm now living with my GF and her sister. I started feeling attracted to her sister since we moved together. Became a close friend of hers and started flirting with her. She started flirting back, looked like she felt guilty, and suddenly stopped. I snooped through her phone and found out she is now dating some guy. From what I found out, it's a responsible, cute guy with a good job who is genuinely in love with her. When I found out I just wanted to beat the shit out of him. He is just who she deserves though. Maybe if he'd been a piece of shit I wouldn't have felt so bad... Oh, and he actually cried with her when her parents died even though he didn't even know them! Husband material! I have lots of friends, constantly reaching out to me. I ignore them most of the time. They seem to all care for me and think highly of me. They all trust me and rely on me. They shouldn't. I've now noticed how I discard people when they become useless to me. When I left uni, I stopped caring about the friends I made there except for when finding a partner for my business. Thinking about them just tires me out...And finally my family. I hate my mom for who she was with me, but mostly because I think I'm like her now. Probably worse. At least she loved her children in her own way. My brothers... Uni dropouts. One had drug problems, he needed my help with that and opened up only to me about his depression that led him to it. Fucking wimp. The other one I barely hear of anymore. He's just stupid. I realize now that I'm a parasite and a terrible person. I haven't disclosed all of this with my therapist and honestly don't plan to. I use people to my own benefit and discard them when they are not useful, all while putting up this stupid facade that I'm kind hearted and caring to make them love me and do what I want. I only ever cared about myself, and now that I see myself for who I am, I hate myself more than anyone. Everything is going great in my life and I can't love anyone or be fucking happy, just get a shot of adrenaline whenever I get something I want. After all I've done, I'd at least like to go out without causing more hurt. I thought I'd make my gf think I cheated on her or something (which would hurt her, but it'd make her lose her attachement for me). Then I'd write a letter saying I'm tired of this materialistic world and myself, and that I need to find myself spiritually. I'd buy a plane ticket to some spiritual country like India with my conjoined account with my gf, that she rarely checks, to consolidate the evidence. I'd say in the letter to sell my stuff (car and expensive things). Finally, I'd just pack a bag with 2 weeks worth of clothing for evidence, throw it in a clothing collection point for poor people and jump off a bridge a few hundred miles from here. This wouldn't allow me to donate my organs but would at least not bring the \"what did i do wrong?\" questions to those who loved me. Also I can't do a few of these things during COVID, but it makes more sense to me than jumping off a building or shooting myself. I'd only do that if no one cared about me... I wish that was the case now. It'd be easier. I've played with the idea for a while and think I may carry it out when I can. The world will be better off. Shit, I get a rush each time I think how smart I am for thinking about every detail like this. I really have no hope. The last views I'd have from the bridge would be awesome. I guess I just wanted to proof check my ideas here to see if there's any hole in my reasoning. Is there any better way to kill myself, really?","14":"Before starting here's the background - I'm a 17 year old kid born and brought up in India, I've never been a bright kid or especially good in anything. Not academically, in sports, socialising, talking to girls or anything tech related. I've never had any friends in my life and I used to sit alone at my bench in school as well, it was agonizing just watching teachers come and go and judge me because I'm the depressed and dead looking kid. They oozed hate upon seeing me. Hence I'm thankful for this pandemic.Never step foot outside my house for anything, I can stay in my room all day alone and be fine with it, that's just a normal day. Loneliness has become a forced lifestyle.Okay so, I've spent the last year battling suicidal thoughts and depression, I'm in a better place now than I was for years and I'm making progress. I've become more open to my flaws and I've spent the past month trying to get in a mindset to fix them.But there is too much I can't fix and can't accept for eg. My dead eyes, my dumb self, and extremely distant personality. This has caused me to have a seperate personality, which rejects the weaker one by enforcing superiority. It's hard to explain but to summarise my life has become a cat and mouse chase, as I go through my tasks and try to enhance my lifestyle bit by bit everyday I realise more and more how much of a useless existence I am and withing a short time the other persona takes over and tells me that I'm second to none and that everything is alright when it's really not.The persona doesn't act as a positive force in my life it just acts as a coping mechanism so I don't fall to depression and suicidal thoughts yet again. It's similiar to how one doesn't remove the blade from the stabbed part so the blood doesn't drain out the person causing him to die faster.I'm trying to look for a solution but as I mentioned I have NO ONE. I mean it when I say that I'm truly alone. There's not one person I can talk to about the years of anguish and pain that I've been holding in for years now. My family would just be anxious for me and tell me to move on, or they won't even care enough (believe me this has happened).I wanna get better and I don't want my darkness to be the death of me but I cannot drain if till I cross paths with someone who understands and who can help me by showing me the way or just being there at least. I do not want to die just another lonely, worthless and waste of space. I need light.","15":"Just turned 24 today. I feel like Im running out of time. Ive had no relationships, have never even talked to a girl in my life. I cut myself, I have crippling anxiety. Im stuck at my ma and pa's home. I have no close friends that I can turn to and open up. Once I did open up to someone and instantly regretted it. It made me feel weak and vulnerable. Im a college dropout. Im a waste. I live in India. And it's getting hard for me to find anything I can do to support myself and be on my own. Im confined to my room. I don't want to burden my mum and dad. I read books (sci fi). At the moment that's the only thing I interpret as something productive. In some ways it's an escape. That's it. Im lost and spiralling hard with nothing in sight except death.","16":"I'm 21(M) from India. Currently studying engineering.It all started 3years back.1. A teacher(I respected him a lot) expelled me from his tuition for some reasons that he didn't bothered to let me know.2. I had a breakup. I had breakups before, but this one caused serious pain. She didn't bothered to even let me know that she's breaking up, she just blocked me and few weeks later a friend sent me a picture of her holding hands with a school friend of mine (that she had posted on Facebook). I talked to the friend(and mutual friends) to confirm things. It was painful, I felt physical pain when I saw the pictures. I shared things with my mother and it got little easier(later I found out she completely misunderstood everything). Then I got depressed.3. My Higher Secondary exams were within few months. I was depressed, I had no one to talk to, I couldn't focus, I skipped classes, I skipped mock tests. I scored very bad in Higher Secondary exams and other entrance. Secured a seat in Tier 2 engineering college with help of caste reservation. Lost all of my self-esteem right then and there.From the 1st event to 3rd event, it was 6 months past. I Used to be a confident person but I lost my confidence, I became sensitive to what people thing about me, retracted myself from most of the social interaction. With College studies and few new friends and a new girlfriend, I was improving but never recovered fully.Right now, I'm in my 5th sem. Through the college years I grew anxious about my future. My parents didn't want me to attend engineering. It was my decision to do engineering, so if anything goes wrong it's completely my fault now. I have 3 backlogs due. Within couple of months placements will start and with backlogs I am not eligible there. I can't stand the image of being jobless(more precisely, without money). I have few family members who are jobless and due to my upbringing or something else, I am very afraid of the situation being poor. I have some skills in programming, I can build apps and website. But so do my other classmates and they have good marks. In India the competition is extreme.I have disappointed my parents(and my teachers) before, I'm doing it again. I don't know if it's worth to wait for worst to come. I feel extreme anxiety, I can't focus on my studies, I'm unstable emotionally, I have no one to share my thoughts, I feel lonely, I don't know if life worth it.","17":"Hello My name is Aayush and i am from India,...i don't know where to start but i feel like i need help....I want to Die but i dont have courage... everyday I think for natural illness or calamity which can kill me...I am an introvert so its hard making friends but i have few friends and I don't know how but i started feeling awkwardness like I dont belong with them..i feel distant...i am not enjoying anything..they are really good friends, they help me whenever i needed but still i am feeling distant nowadays, nothing excites me anymore, i want to enjoy but i dont know how...i want to express myself to my friends but i dont have confidense to confront with them....when we are together they laugh together and then there is me who is sitting at side just looking at them and wondering what if i was laughing with them i should feel connected but noo i am not and started taunting myself... I have very low self esteem... I really hope that someone come for me and give me a tight hug that can cure my stupid thoughts...i dont even have a girlfriend and I am 22 years old, haha what a loser, anyways thanks for reading, i dont know if its a depression or not, should i consult a doctor ?","18":"Does anyone have any advice on how to handle extreme stress. My life already isn't that good. To make that worse, I'm a 23 year old guy and I'm losing my hair. I'm already not that good looking. But I used to have amazing thick wavy hair. That was one thing I had going for me. I'm not insecure about my looks. I am okay with the way I look. But I'm not ready to lose my hair. I'M FROM INDIA. So it's a big deal here. Whether it is going for a job interview or looking for partners. Baldness is treated as a very negative trait. It's also a laughing matter over here. It IS hereditary btw. But my father started losing his hair around 30. It's too early for me. It took me YEARS to finally become an outgoing person. I'm afraid that going completely bald might throw me back to my old ways.","19":"First of all my english is not that good.Iam an engineering graduate from india.  Right now iam preparing for some of the competitive examinations. My personality is that i get tensed for every problems whether it be small or largeThe problem that haunts me for past several years was that everything is happening just the opposite to what i think. For example, if i think that i will reach the college early tomorrow then on the next day i cannot reach the college on time.. It feels weird.. I just feel that the entire universe is acting against me. Now as i said iam preparing for a competitive exam, when i try to solve the mock test, iam not able to solve any of them now this makes me further angry and sad. At present iam having no interest in anything iam sitting idle inside my room, thinking that i cant pass the exams and i cannot get a good job. Iam feeling tensed and depressed every single moment and its becoming worse day by day.  So i just hope if Someone could help me to deal with this situation.","20":"Let me preface by saying that I don't hate my life. I have a government job (people in India will actually be able to tell you how awesome that is) and I quickly attained promotions. I earn really well and believe it or not, pandemic had no impact on our jobs or our salaries. I have to run a branch. I am responsible for getting things done by 10 people. Some of whom are my age. As a kid I was a quick learner and I was book smart. As I grew up, I just start getting dumber and dumber, I feel. Lots of childhood trauma. Manipulative parents. Father physically abused us regularly. We used to dread Sundays because he would be home and he would find a silly excuse to pick a fight with my mother. He would just beat her senseless. I distinctly remember one day where my mother had to go to work with a purple bruise on her face. My mom suffered so much for us, yet over the years, she has quietly manipulated my sister and I. I am not ungrateful. I would quite literally lay my life for my mom but I noticed her manipulative nature very late in life. Fast forward to my 20s and I bagged a government job and I quickly attained promotions. I attribute that to luck. Because I know I didn't work much for the promotions. I know deep down inside. Now I am the head of the branch and I just feel like a fraud. I feel useless too because I am not street smart enough to counter all the lame excuses that these people make to get out of work. My incumbent did a great job and I am not able to reach 50% of what he has achieved. I hate going to work. Literally I just feel like getting into an accident on my way to work so that I do not have to deal with so many people all the goddamn time. I should have just prepared well and bagged another job but I have already wasted 5 years in this soul sucking job and I have turned too lazy to even study anything any more. I know I am royally fucking up my life but I am too numb to care about anything anymore.","21":"I've been depressed for quite sometime but only very recently I saw a therapist because I felt like I couldn't take it anymore.For some background, I'm from India and mental health is not something people are aware of and people think it's bs. I'm also not well off and therapy in India is expensive, at least for the people of our income. Also, in India parents beat their children up and I was a lot as a kid. My therapist is amazing and next week is my third session. But yesterday I overheard my parents conversation and my mom was saying something along the lines of \"There's no reason for her to be depressed, we've always made sure she is happy. It's because we don't spend much money on her, she wants us to waste money on this. And since we beat her as a child she's making things difficult for us to take revenge. She doesn't have any other problem\"My family friend tried explaining my condition to my mom and she said Idk if she'll get fixed by this treatment but she's definitely is making life difficult for usI loved her dearly but now I can't look at her without feeling a mix or angry and said. My life had always been tough but now I don't even wanna live knowing the way my mom thinks of me.","22":"So this is my first time on this sub-reddit ,Some Information about me ig:-So I'm currently a 16 year old from India , born and raised but Not your typical Indian kid , to give you an idea I'm that skinny , awkard and shy but dark af school shooter type kid in your school.Ok here's goes nothing So let's rewind back to 2017 , this is year all the stuff started to turn south and just go to shit , as you would have guessed it these middle school years are the most important in any kids life , Was mine important? Yes . Was it good ? hell to say the atleast . I met a Girl , let's pretend her name is Alice , Alice is your typical cute , sweet , smart and out of your league kind of girl , but being kid I was I still wanted to talk to her , impress her and gain her attention , almost like Clout . well we hit it off we started to talk and stuff , fast forward to 2018 ,it's January and I know Alice very well , and things start to change , I start to see her in a different way... It was a crush ... and I decided to act on it , so one faithful day I told her that I liked her on the bus ( we shared the bus and class ) . Her response was nothing , no reply , I went home thinking had I fucked up ? did I make her uncomfortable ? I didn't know what to do .... for some reason I thought guys talking about their feelings for her would make her scared .. boy was I wrong , turns out she already had a boyfriend  , guess who ? turns out he's one of my bestfriend .. let's call him Chad , Chad here who is still currently my bestfriend , I have known him for almost 6 years now , I didn't expect this from him considering He just fucked the \" BRO CODE \" , I had told him \"Hey man , I kinda have a crush on Alice , will you help me out \" , turns out the cunt was helping Himself , Can't say I blame him , If you had the chance to date the hottest girl in your school with no strings or tricks attached , would you do it ... so I was broken I didn't know what to say , my own bestfriend had shafted me and I chose to keep quite .. through all this shitstorm I continued to talk , despite it killing me inside knowing I was \" never good enough for her and not to her liking \" ... The Chad and Alice relationship didn't last ever long.. to skip abit She continued on to get 13 boyfriends over the span of 2 years , i had endure the pain , insecurity and anxiety knowing I was never good enough , that I never tried hard enough , that I should have given her all my attention , Combined with Alice I had some problems back home , my own family was falling part , My dad had moved abroad and only visits during Christmas , my mom on the other hand , is an ex-teacher , she always believes I was meant for greatness and all that bullshit but I don't believe it anymore , anyways she puts ridiculously high expectations , for me which it's almost hilarious considering how epic I would fail at these expectations , anyways back to the 13 boyfriends , Do you know how does it feel like to have your soup ripped out 13 different times to then piece it back together to then just let it get ripped out ? well I have ... I died in 2018 my body just living on with my memories , I'm just the Husk of the person I used be , The best part I had no one to speak , to vent , fuck I couldn't even cry in own goddamm room , This spiral of Hell lead to one place \" Sucide \" , found a cool place to do it , thought If I'm dying might as well jump off a Building and get a good view before it all goes black.... but then if I wasn't such a pussy i would have died that day , but as soon I had reached the terrace of the Building , I start to remember the people close to me , My mom , My dad , what would happened to them? I didn't want them to think they were bad parents , I didn't want to waste their money on educating , feeding and providing me a good home ...I didn't want them to think they were a burden to me ... so I stepped off , unfortunately those memories , those demons never left , now in 2020 , it's only gotten worse by the age of 15 ,I done weed , vape and probably smoked 25 cigerettes which you might think is \" ehhh not too bad \" , I live in a Backward Country  , people younger than me have substance abuse ... But Alice on the other hand , guess what still in my school , is this a Cruel joke or something ? Does God think I'm his Sims character just to be tortured with FUCKIN constant bullshit ? idk what to do at this point in my life ..... I'm drowning , I'm Choking , I'm Dying....Now I'm changed person , Alice she changed me , not in a good way though , She taught me to never expect much from any person ... , As for my mental health , ehhh demons are still there , banging on door waiting to be unlocked .. waiting to haunt me again .... fulfill their wish of finally killing me ... I don't need help ... I need to die without anyone knowing what happened to me and where I went ? I don't want to die anymore I just want to stop existing , I just wanna hit a button and go \"Ka Poof \".....","23":"Hi Reddit, I need to share something... **About me:**I'm turning 29 at the beginning of 2021. I've moved to UK for studies and for a better life, so I'm not planning to go back to my home country. English is also not my native language. I'm working in a large global company making above 3000\u00a3 per month which I think is quite good for someone of my age. I am 6 feet tall, fit - working out regularly for years around 3 times a week. So I'd say I am relatively good looking, educated and have a good income. **My story:**For the past 4 years I live alone. I am staying in a house share, but never met anyone here with whom I could get along with mostly because these were people who had came to London temporarily for work and left after few months + most of them were much older. So it was fine to chit-chat in the kitchen sometimes but that's it. At my company I am working only with males (mostly in their late 30 or 40+, it is very rare to see a women of my age in my office(floor), so I have never had a chance to meet any girl at work. I always thought that at a company like mine in London I will be able to meet with someone but unfortunately I was wrong. After 3 years I still have a contact with same age group of people who are mostly married and with kids and now  WFH kicked in as well. I'd like to meet someone who is similar in terms of career goals and education level.**My dates:**Since I felt lonely I stared using dating apps. It's a pain... but I managed to date few girls. First one was a nurse, she was okay but what was weird; she was carrying everywhere her best gay friend, and she was mentioning him very often(i have no problem with gays), once we were on a date (maybe only  I thought I am on a date?) and that guy just joined out of nowhere at our meeting, so awkward... all in all... it didn't last long.Another one was a student from Asia. I really like her, she came to do MBA, she was educated and intelligent, overconfident but she also had two faces... that other one was drinking and all that stuff. She had a lot of alcohol and weed at her place. Every weekend she was getting drunk, smoke, going to a night club etc. for me it was a bit too much but anyway I had a chance to date someone whom I was into. It was fun but one night she was doing a birthday party so she invited her friends and me as well but she asked me to pretend we are not dating (we were for few months already) and I am just friend, it was soo weird and I didnt feel good about it. We all got drunk that evening.. she didn't want me to be close to her or even dance with me, so I was just on a side... and her other drunk friend somehow came to me and started kissing me... and without more details that how this relation finished. I met also with some other girls from Thailand and Brazil but it didn't work long term cause they were not speaking english well and we didn't have much common topics to talk about + they were not exactly what I am looking for but still it was nice to be with someone around for some time. **My online dates:**I also had few online girls which were lonely like me and were looking for someone on the internet. Just not to make this post too long I'll briefly say that they were from asia. With first one i talked around a year but she end up finding someone else in UK and got married(guy in his late 30).Another one I knew for almost 2 years, we met twice in India but at the end she told me that her parents forced her into arranged marriage, so it would be a huge disgrace for her family if she would call that off.  It hurt me for a long time cause we knew each other really well. We were talking daily. 4 months before her marriage we were on holiday together and slept together. She told me that if I'd tell her earlier that we may be together then maybe it could work. The third one was also from India but she found me on Tinder in London. I think she is even in worse situation than me cause she used to date a lot of foreigners in her country but she end up being alone and now she would like to start a family and have a kid but she has no one - we just stopped talking but again it was good for me to have someone I could talk to.Currently I am doing similar thing as above with another girl from Asia who has found me on instagram. She works in similar field as me, so there is always something to talk about and we understand each other quite well. We can't meet because of covid and she also used to date bunch of guys there but anyway... I feel I am wasting time as in the cases above and at the end of the day I'll just waste a lot of time talking with her.**Covid times:**Now during pandemic I try online dating again but it doesn't work really, got some matches here and there but I don't really like my matches. I found few girls on Instagram which I like but I am not sure if I could actually go on a date with someone whom I found on Instagram?I think scrolling dating apps and instagram looking for someone I could match with had negative impact on my mental health cause very often I feel disappointment, saddens, rejection. Unfortunately, I also developed a habit of masturbation which is sometimes few times a day if I am off work and I spend too much time on those apps.  I haven't slept with any girl for more than a year now and I feel like I am also missing that but I don't want to have sex with any random girl, I need to feel that connection with that person otherwise it is better to jerk off alone and move on with life. My other problem is 'Work From Home'. My company does not allow anyone come back to the office till April at least. I am only renting a single room so it is a madness sometimes. It feels like being in prison. I work from this place, I eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. I spend my weekends here... madness... before at least I could go to the office, meet people from work, go for a lunch together, drinks or some social activities after work... now it's no longer available and will not be for a long time. Since I live 30 min from central London, I was thinking that maybe renting a whole flat in central London would give me more opportunities to meet new people? Currently I am living in quiet area full of families with kids and pensioners not much is really happening locally.**My main issues:**I'd like to find someone long term and just move on with my life and career... all that dating thing is a huge waste of time to me but on the other hand I don't want to be with someone just of sake of having someone. I don't know how am I supposed to meet someone. Office didn't work and with WFH posture will become even more difficult. I saw on reddit people advice to join some clubs... but what I am supposed to join? Ballet dance club? I joined football club and yea it was male only.  I also don't have any friends of my age here, so I never got invited anywhere. People also advised to try clubs or pubs... but I feel going alone to the pub and talking to random girls is weird, especially that my english is not perfect and I also have an accent.I'd like to keep focus on my career and further education but all those dating apps, instagram and people i meet there are distracting me but if I cut it off then I feel like something is  missing in my life, that I have noone to talk to (it is quite often that I have a days when I don't open my mouth to anyone and just talk to myself in my mind).I don't know what to do with my life now... I have a good job, money... I am a bit scary that I'll end up being 35 and will be in the same point dating-wise. I'd  like to find someone around 26yo, so that the girl doesn't have that pressure on her that she has to have a baby very soon. I am worried that it may be a case if I meet a girl in her 30.Since you already know my past... the other issue is actually talking about that to a new person which I met when she asks about my social life cause as you can see it is weird. I don't know how to change that. All that makes me feel more and more overwhelmed and depressed. There is also no one I could share that with cause people would think I am freaking out here and also I am sure that if I'd share that with someone that person wouldn't keep it in secret.What I should do now with my life? I am stuck... sometimes I feel maybe I should move to Asia where more girls would find me interesting.. I really don't know. &amp;#x200B;Thanks if you read till the end. I'll appreciate all feedback and advice. Maybe some of you were in similar situation at some point in your life.","24":"I've been in love with a girl from college we've dated since the past two years and now we were looking forward to get married, we both are from india and it's a little culturally regressive atmosphere here. So we belong to different cultures and the thing is when we decided to move ahead with our marriage she knew her family won't agree, so she said let's run away. But I for some twisted fate decided to ask her to get her parents consent. There's too much trouble here if you just run away. She approached her family and they didn't agree (duh) it's been more than 4 months there's no progress from their end, no she's captive there and they've threatened that if you go the mother will die of shock because she is a heart patientI've been patient for this time, she tries to talk to me daily through some or the other social network site , just texts, they don't let her call me or talk to me. So for the last week I've been asking her to push a way through, to do something atleast, talk to her family about your wishes or just run away when you get the chance but she says let's wait , I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it two days and so on , i mean she was procrastinating. So I asked a friend of mine who's elder to me and someone like a sister in my life to talk to her sister and sort things out on some level. But that didn't work out at all, now I am blocked at all places there's no way to reach her and I feel like I lost everything like every last hope I had of this to work out.How does one cope with this ? I don't feel like eating, i don't feel like working or doing things I usually did ? I feel like I don't even have the strength to get out of bed  help me !","25":"I am sorry for my english didn't edited it.I don't know why i am writing perhaps in a hope that i even don't know. I will not lie about anything and would be 100% transparent.I am from a small city in India.So back when i was a kid i used to dream big that i will become someone, like i will get into this institute will do this job then will start doing this and settle in a country either japan or korea. Being small and wanting to complete my dream i studied studied and studied always was a bright student with good grades i had learnt abacus to increase my calculations speed and even stood all india rank 3, two times doing it. Then came the 10th got a whooping 10 cgpa. Was in the right direction to complete my dream.But you know what there were two blunders which happened1. I didn't know what was my passion or what i wanted to do or in which field i wanted to go into i didn't knew what i want to be good at from childhood i was told to study and you will be good.2. My family is not financially stable and is really conservative something like my dreams were laughed off when i told it to one of my family members she said this to me-\"Don't set you eyes too high because if you will fall down with face forward you will never be able to show your face others.\"\"You are not from a developed country like the us or uk where people get choices of what they want to do in their life and neither from a rich family you don't have choices to make because you can't become a failure in an attempt to make your dreams come true.\"And that's when all the bad things startedEven securing 10cgpa I didn't get admission in the top school due to high fees and got addmitted into a underlevel school and from there it keeps on getting worse the subjects i was taught and the exams i gave didn't showed any results because I didn't had any interest in them i used to study day and night with tears in my eyes to get good grades but never got them everytime i saw my marks on paper i cried and hoped that i will work even harder but i didn't happened and then on the report card day it showed 7.2 cgpa. I know that day i cried all day in my bathroom because i didn't wanted my parents to listen as they were doing there best to support the family. Every day i used to cry and hoped that it will get better. Tomorrow will be better day after tommorrow will be better the next day will be better but nothing changed nothing.I prayed to god what i had done wrong ?I never bullied anyone, never harassed anyone, never beated someone, never made fun of the unfortunate, never sexually harassed then why i am feeling so horrible why? Crying everyday with no one to talk it feels really bad i dont know what to say about this feeling i dont want to feel it anymore I can't see my dreams which i made as a kid i cannot go to the school because of low income of my family why? Going to a tier 3 college is not what i dreamed of and suddenly one day my little sister asked me this-Bhaiya (big brother) why have you got so serious you never laugh and smile?And then i realized that i had lost my smile over these 2 past years i dont how to say this but i was always a cheerful guy always smiling but,  but i just don't know the smile which i had has faded of and vanished i dont feel anything now its like i am physically dead the hope which i had for these 2 years that tomorrow will be better, it will get better it just happens to be an illusion i cannot tolerate this much pain now of beliving that something good will happen god will help,may be tommorrow will be a good day but it just doesn't happens. I prayed, had paitence, believed that it will get better even with tears in my red eyes whenever i cried quietly in my bath room or grabbed my pillow to not let someone here my sobbing voices.But the smile which wore two years back still hasn't come back the person which i had two years back still hasn't come back the dreams which i saw day and night still have not come back i feel horrible horrible it looks like i am worthless i am a fool to hope things i think i shouldn't had dreamed everytime i remember i burst into tears of why can't i change things why cant i ? I just want my mindset back like i used to have it 2, years before and rather than typing this with eyes full of tears i just want my smile and laughter back which i had  2 years before. If you have read till here i am thanking you a bunch to stay this long with me even though i am a stranger you are super cool like sister brother to me i bet you are super cool person and would achieve great heights in life.Thank you for your time really thank you.","26":"I'm a male 28, India. The only thing that gets me out if bed is that I need to take care of my aging parents. But I've been stuck in the same place for the last 10 years or so. Spinning my wheels. Just stuck there.And I'm losing strength. I feel like I'm running out of time and I cannot afford to seek professional help.I have run out of funds after we had to pay for the treatment of my grandpa's heart surgery.Father had to change jobs, new one doesn't pay as much. Getting difficult to pay the home loans. Covid has been difficult. I may be next in line to be fired in my line of work. Even more difficult to get hired now I don't know what to do. The hole in my chest keeps growing bigger. I'm scared. I have been for a long time. But now I can feel it showing on my face. Depression made sure all my friends dropped out of my circle at some point. Unable to reach them for help. I'm tired. I'm very tired.","27":"(This is gonna be long. Sorry. Thanks for everyone that took time in reading.)I\u2019m dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety lately.. I\u2019m not able to think straight. (Self-esteem issues aswell.)Let me tell you a little bit about me.I came to the US when I was 13. I had experienced middle school for 3 months. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience but it was ok, I was a social butterfly then.. I could easily talk to people.. but I felt a little awkward as they were a bit more reserved. they had their own little group going on. It was hard to fit in. Then I thought.. \u201cmaybe it me. Maybe I\u2019m supposed to be reserved.\u201d Fast forward to high school, 9th grade is where I was awkward as heck.. I tried making friends but I was that awkward mingling with everyone. Now that I\u2019m typing this I realize that guys being emotional is a bad thing. I have the tendency to connect emotionally with the person I\u2019m talking\/friends with. So when ever I talk to someone for more than 15 minutes.. it gets awkward.. especially if it\u2019s a girl.. \u201cdo you like me?\u201d Is what I get.. and then I give them an answer saying.. \u201cas a friend, yes.\u201d Because I had no intentions of dating in high school. I was just too busy with school work.. and my home liked was a disaster with my controlling parents that have high expectations. I stopped trying after that, I stopped trying to talk to people or make friends. Only friends I had was from my 4 year varsity tennis activity.  My life in high school was, go to school, come home, finish homework and play video games until midnight. Now the topic video games. That was the only outlet I had to any social life. I feel like I ruined any (if I had any) social ability. I was hooked to video games until January 2020. (Schooling was great, grades were mostly A\u2019s and B\u2019s)My parents left for a vacation in January, which gave me time to think about myself and reflect. JAN 06 2020. That was the day I said fk it to video games and got a gym membership. I paid for 2 months of personal training.. to get me started. My personal trainer was like a father to me. I told him everything I was dealing with while trained. He really helped me with my styling and grooming choices. I lost 40lbs in the past 12 months. Built a good bit of muscle. (I was chubby before I started working out.) from the moment I started going to the gym.. I had that hunger on making myself better and ready for social connections. I started working on my insecurities.PRESENT ISSUES AND ISSUES IM FACING AND TRYING TO CONQUER.Im 21 M, 5\u20196, big forehead that looks like a receding hairline but... it was like that from childhood. (RACE: INDIAN.)I realize that I\u2019ve developed social anxiety.. my palm get sweaty when I try to talk to people for the first time.. but it gets better when I talk to them more. I\u2019m reading books about putting myself out there more. But covid so it\u2019s hard to make social connections.Depression: the only family I though would have my back and encourage me.. my dad, mom, both side grandparents. They point out all my flaws that I can\u2019t fix just pushing me 10 steps back when I\u2019m working on myself. It hurts a lot. I stopped talking to my grandparents as I want nothing to do with them anymore. My grandfather was in the hospital and I talked to him once, he criticized me even when he was on that hospital and I really felt a slap to my face. (Call me Ahole but i didn\u2019t want to deal with all the set back.) I stopped talking to him.My life is miserable. Controlled like a puppet and I\u2019m not going to give in any longer. I stopped talking to my parents aswell.. I just come home and lock my door.. it gives me to more time and Space to wager my options.I have 2 options.1. Get a job here in the US and move out of my parents house, fall in love.. and see where it takes me.2. Be daddy\u2019s and mommy\u2019s b**** and move back to India to marry someone I don\u2019t have feelings for.I personally like option 1.. let\u2019s just say it also acts as a revenge for them always trying to point out my flaws. But I genuinely want this (not just for the sakes of revenge.)But here\u2019s the problem where my anxiety spikes.. who\u2019s gonna love me? I\u2019m short! My hair isn\u2019t that great! Let alone I\u2019m Indian! My race has been my biggest insecurities for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m attractive enough. Due to my family.. I don\u2019t trust people that easily.. but when I do.. I go to great lengths for them.Thanks in advance for any advice you give me.","28":"I live in India where people don\u2019t really care about mental health.

I used to be a really good student until covid happened. Before covid, I was one of those students that just got grades without studying much. After covid, I sort of just let go and my life was so boring and I was so demotivated that I couldn't seem to focus or take interest in anything. Mid September I had a huge panic attack. I was so overwhelmed about all the time that I wasted, I started crying and I couldn't stop. I studied harder than I've ever studied in my life. I put in 16 (sometimes 18-19) hours of work a day and I just didn't feel like I deserved to eat or sleep because of all the time I had previously wasted. The more I studied, the worse my grades got. And this is still happening. I led myself on to believe that I can do this. I changed my study pattern, time, Material, etc. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP. talked to my teachers about it. They just tell me to not be stressed. Like it's just that easy. I constantly have thoughts of self harm and I just see no way through this. Btw I'm studying for something that I genuinely have interest in. I'm even scared to open my books because I know I'll get questions wrong and just have a breakdown. This fear has grown so big that I actually threw up one day because of how stresed I was. My hands start shaking when I'm giving a mock test. I'm just so tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm so sick of feeling so shitty all the time.","31":"Coming from country like India where chalta ha (meaning: it's alright) thing works.  I can assure you i never got mental support when needed.

I hate crying alone in blanket. I just want to end my suffering. I hate seeing myself 10 years ahead, without resources, living a life-less life. I just want to be loved and start a good family. I don't want anybody to feel pity for me or sorry me. I just want someone to hug me and tell me everything will be okay even if it won't.

Sorry I am bad at writing and I tend to ramble for a while. I am a 21YO M studying Medicine (to become a doctor). I started studying Medicine in 2017 but failed the year (first year of freedom, sort of thing), so I had to repeat the year. When I had to tell my parents, both of them got annoyed and angry at me for failing a year (I received a 54% with supplementary exams but the exam cut off was 56%). My parents are from India and they still retain the mindset regarding education (everything is a competition and people look down on people who fail). I have always wanted to be away from my parents (for reasons I don't want to go into). I study in a different state (I am 2000 km away from them) and I always make an excuse to be away from them for as long as possible so I can enjoy myself before having to return to them and become someone different. For example, I purposely picked an elective subject that made me come back to university in January\/February, which I enjoyed and made a few more friends (this all happened before COVID-19 lockdowns). I am always friendly and I know most people in my year by name. However, I use to have about 6 people I trust when I am going through a lot of shit and need some advice\/talk to someone. When lockdowns went into effect, I went back home (as all university classes went online and my family wanted me back, against my wishes obviously). I was with family from March to June at home in Vic, before QLD was implementing new border measures for Vic. When I was down in Vic, the few things I enjoyed were driving early in the morning to pick up bread from the bakery early in the morning, driving in and out of the town, cooking and watching YT videos. Anyway, I got back into QLD with a few university mates (we called this \"Race to the Border\") 1hr and 30 mins before the new changes were being implemented. However this semester I had started consuming more alcohol than I had the years previously. When I get drunk, my depression and anxiety tend to get worse, especially with the negative self-talk. Sometimes I would just bottle them up, but when it gets worse I messaged a few of my \"trusted\" friends. During one of these episodes, one of them said I should go to the Emergency Department (this was at 1:00 am on a Saturday). The doctors told me it was good I came in and didn't self-harm (I do have a history). Anyway, another friend told me to see the uni therapist which I did and still do (as it helps a bit). However about one month ago, I was getting drunk and my depressive and anxiety episode triggered again (the first time in a month). This is when I lost 3 of my 'trusted' friends, telling me to not contact them again with a few harsh words from one of them (she was also drunk at a party she was throwing at her house). I only contacted one more of my trusted friends and she was supportive, even asking me how I was feeling the following morning. Anyway, after this, I didn't consume much alcohol as I needed to concentrate on my studies but I started bottling up my emotions again. (I do understand that the 3 people who told me to not contact them were probably doing it for themselves as it can be very draining)Today, however, I was feeling quite lonely while studying. Normally I don't feel lonely but today really hit hard which is why I just wrote out this wall of text. I have not contacted anyone as I am scared of breaking more friendships (I don't leech off people, if any of my friends asked me for anything, I would try my best to do it\/help them, no matter what it is, I would still do anything for the 3 friends that told me to basically f\\*\\*k off). At the moment, I am feeling like a disappointment, worthless, pathetic and tired. After this, I will probably just sleep it off and start my day again with trying to study for the exam. Also, I have paid for 2 tickets to attend 2 'End-of-Year' events but right now, I am questioning whether I should go to them. These events are occurring on the 13th and 14th of November (after my exams finish). Anyway, to whoever reads this, I hope you are having a good day and staying safe.","36":"On 4th March 2019, my dad found a tiny squirrel in our parking, he was a few hours old at that time abandoned by its mother because he fell down from somewhere and had some injuries. My dad took him home and we decided to take care of him until he was ready to ride the world. We named him Shiva. We made him a small bed using cotton and warm clothes. In just a day he was jumping around out house but he'd barely eat\/drink anything. I got a dropper for him to feed milk, he'd just drink 3-4 drops and done. He'd sit on my dad's foot and roam around the house, he sit on my shoulders while I caressed him. He was most attached to my mother, he would find warmth in my mother's palm and would always curl himself in there. I was really fun having him around. A week passed and everything was pretty fine, I searched for some articles on google about taking care if a squirrel. I used to follow all the necessary steps. But one day he seemed tired, he'd barely eat or drink, mostly sat in my mother's palm whole day while my mother trying to feed him. I searched for some more articles about his condition but couldn't get any help. We decided to take him to a vet. There's only a government veterinary hospital in our town. Basically, an old government building with just a hall containing a vet and an assistant to him. My mother and I took him there. As soon as the vet heard it was a squirrel which was sick, he looked at his assistant and both started laughing. The assistant literally said \"Kya hi bachega\" while both were still smiling.  None of them even touched Shiva and concluded that he'd die. They didn't give any prescription or any kind of treatment to the tiny life. My mother was crying on our way back to our home. I researched if a small dose of paracetamol could be given to him and found that we could. We gave him the lightest dose of paracetamol. By evening his condition worsened. He was now unable to move his limbs, his eyes looking upon my mother while she was crying with him in her palm. It was one of the most sad moments I've experienced till now. The emotional bond which was made between us and him in just a few days was strong and no one could hold their tears, my sister who lives away from home for studying was crying at her place even she didn't even meet Shiva. She had just seen his photos and videos we used to send. My father sitting on sofa, sobbing, couldn't see him in his eyes. We knew his time had come, any minute we could lose him. My mom, still crying, started to chant Mahamrityunjay Mantra hoping that he'd survive or attain Moksha. It was that moment when my mom had chanted the mantra exactly five times, his soul left his body. Our tiny little cute Shiva was no longer with us. We didn't eat or sleep that night. We just couldn't believe the fact that he was no longer with us. The next morning, we buried him in our backyard. We bid him our last goodbye. A tiny life was lost because of less facilities in hospitals in smaller towns of India. Despite being a district, it's still a town where I live. I know thousands of lives are lost everyday but when a life gets attached to you, you don't wanna lose it but when you do, either you could blame yourself or anyone involved. In our case, it was lack of facilities in our town. No private veterinary clinic in the town, the nearest is 300kms away. Not only veterinary, everyday when I open newspaper, I read news about accidents, firing, self harm, etc and in the end of the news article it's always \"Referred to so and so city\" and most of the time the victim loses his life in the travel. We don't want no public parks, we don't want no swimming pools, we don't want no fancy Gandhi squares, we just want better hospitals, doctors, nurses, compounders and everyone involved in medical department.[Shiva's Images](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/O2E0jzn)","37":"I've (F26 from India) been suffering the impact of what I feel is ocd, depression, social anxiety and panic a lot lately. My general physician recommended me a good Neuropsychiatrist a while back. I'm considering going now that I'm feeling really into depression.But there's 2 things that's keeping me from going, so please help me make a decision...1. Does every psychiatrist talk to the patient alone? I'm too scared to let my family know any details about this and am really scared that the doctor will start asking questions in front of my family member. I'm scared the room won't be sound-proof, so anyone outside can hear the conversation. Will all my details be kept totally confidential?2. Do the doctor always prescribe medicines? I'm very uncomfortable taking medicines (have had to take so many medicines for other illness recently). Can it be only therapies or something?Please let know from your experiences. It'll be a lot helpful for me to prepare for the visit. Thank you.","38":"Waddup Redditors,&amp;#x200B;I'm contemplating a lot of stuff right now. I need this outlet.&amp;#x200B;I'm Indian and in my mid twenties, come from a fairly OK to do family, live and work in one of the major metros. Lived my entire life in Indian concrete jungles only (mom and dad moved around a lot). Financially, i do OK for myself. The money's not great but it pays the bills and i manage to save a decent chunk if it. I'm only doing this job for now cause it pays the bills. I don't think I'm depressed but just aimless and it's now driving me nuts. I know exactly why and it's quite simple: Pretty much all the stuff advertised to me as being associated with the good life doesn't appeal to me in any way: Fancy house, car, vacations, parties...... all that crap. Simply put, most aspects of life don't appeal to me. I'm not materialistic at all and only use my money for the essentials. I have no idea what to do with the rest of it. I've lost interest in everything and everyone. It's boredom rather than depression (do correct me if I'm wrong). I have nothing to aspire to. It's been that way for a couple of years now. I tend to try getting the real purpose of any venture or undertaking and it doesn't seem to get me anywhere. This has started to affect my social life. Almost everyone I come across thinks and talks about stuff that I have absolutely no interest in: career opportunities, cool stuff to buy, who partied where? who's making how much? who's dating who? Stuff that I simply don't give a shit about. I'm off mainstream social media, don't give a fuck about my LinkedIn account and have no clue what to do. Life does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I simply don't give a fuck about doing the stuff that regular people aspire to do: rise in your career, get married, raise a family, acquire a good reputation and retire rich. So I don't really see the point of living.  Though I don't have moments of extreme sadness with how my life turned out or I turned out or wishing I could have regular aspirations like everyone else,  I do feel like I'm just lying on a bed of roses watching life pass me by.&amp;#x200B;I keep fantasizing about disappearing from everyone and everything, moving somewhere far away maybe to another distant country, start living and working on a farm or in the hills or mountains or something. In a country where no one's ever gonna even think of searching for me there (if it does come down to that). My idea of the perfect life there would be to keep things extremely simple: Rise, work on the farm till the evening and then take a break for the rest of the day: watch the sunset and the scenery, do some drinking, smoke some pot and then contemplate the meaning of life until bedtime. Keep doing this with the hope that I die in my early thirties. The idea is to get away from everything and everyone and be close to nature or to simpler people and not rot in an urban shit hole where almost everyone's caught up in a dick measuring contest.&amp;#x200B;Except that I love and care too much about my family to actually do this. Plus given that I live in India where the ideas of status and reputation in society are so ingrained in you from the start, doing something like this would affect my parents reputation. Not that I give a fuck about mine.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Anyone else feel the exact same way? I feel like there aren't a lot many people who feel this way.","39":"I laugh in my day.

I am 18 years old and my brother is 20 years old. My brother and I were from India, where we were abandoned in an orphanage and where we were neglected and malnourished. My brother is the only biological family and the only blood family that I have. We were adopted in 2006 to a white American man and a Guyanese woman. When my brother and I were being adopted, we thought that we were going to have a good life, but what we really didn't know is that the neglect would not stop. Every year and every day of both my brother and my life, we have always said thank you and have always shown gratitude towards our adopted parents for giving us a brand new life. For giving us food, for taking us on vacation, for allowing us to live in a house where we can sleep on a comfy bed, and for having a tv, etc. Our adopted mom is narcissist, toxic, and manipulative. She has physically and emotionally abused us both. I remember when we were meeting our adopted parents for the first time, before going on the plane, I had started crying; and of course, this was when I was four years old. (all four-year-olds and toddlers cry). So when I was crying my adopted mom had dragged me into the bathroom and started hitting me and threatened to hit me with a comb. Not only was that the first time my adopted mom had started hitting me but when I came to the US and started preschool, I was crying and my mom took me in the bathroom at preschool and started hitting me. My mom continuously started hitting me for the stupidest reasons. So because my brother and I were raised in an orphanage, we didn't really know much. My brother and I have never seen a dog or knew what Christmas or thanksgiving or anything was. I didn't know what a bathrobe was, so my adopted mom got mad at me and started chasing me around with a clothes hanger, beating me with it. I remember when I was in 2nd or third grade, every time my mom looked at my homework for reading or math, she would get frustrated and start hitting me over and over and over again until I understood the problem. My adopted mom continued to hit us; she started hitting us with a belt and the vacuum wire. To be honest, I did call the social service but they didn\u2019t do any good. They said in PA we kids are allowed to be hit\/beat, as long as we don\u2019t have any scars or feel any other emotion, which is soooooo bizar. My mom continued to threaten to kick both me and my brother out of the house.Ever since My brother and I were adopted, my parents have kept our birth records and all of our adoption files hidden in their room. They had bought a special lock that you punch in some code numbers that allows you to get in. (Just like how you dial a password on your phone). I am so curious to find out about my birth parents. My parents told me that my birth parents died when I was young. My biological mother died when I was just born and my biological father also died when I was just a couple of months old and died from a heart attack. My dad decided to put a camera in his room. I honestly don\u2019t know why when he has a locked door, which I don\u2019t know the password to. As time flew by, my brother and I were starting to grow up to become teens to adults. My adopted parents, however, bought us both iPhones that cost $300-$600 and put restrictions, blocks, and trackers on our phones, they said that the phones were used for emergencies only. And when I mention emergency use only, I mean mom, dad, and police. I honestly don't get why they couldn\u2019t just get cheap flip- phones that cost at least $80 or $90? Not only did my parents have a problem with not trusting me and my brother, but my parents also didn\u2019t trust us in general, they thought that we did drugs, buy alcohol, and throw some random parties in the house even though we have never in our life have we ever done such a thing. Let me just tell you this, because I find it really messed up and really obnoxious. So when my dad accused me of throwing a party in the house I was literally laughing so hard and making so many stupid jokes. Let me tell you why. I live in PA in private development. My neighbors would call the police on each other for so many dumb reasons. So our neighbors would call the police on each other for various reasons such as someone is playing their music too loud, or someone just trespassed on to my property, or someone just targeted their gun to my house, or someone\u2019s kid just ran away, called the child service. I would literally record the amount of times our neighbor has called the cops on each other and I would shove the video in front of someone's face to show if I would dare throw a wild party and have someone call the cops on me and have them chasing me. Not only have my parents falsely accused us of doing stuff we would never do or stalk on our phones and add restrictions and trackers, but this one just gets more messed up. So I got my driver's license in May and I have not driven since then. So Christmas finally came, and my dad bought me a car. Let me rephrase that one\u2026 (I thought my dad bought me a car and I thought he trusted me with it). But, he didn\u2019t trust me a single bit. Every Time I was driving in the car with him, he would get so nasty with me that he would punch me and start yelling at me and treated me so badly and so mean. My dad was then Going to New York and he had accused me of stealing the car he got me for Christmas or of driving it without his permission rather than. But Never have I ever done that because I still had forgotten how to drive. So he has been hiding the car keys away from me, and he has not let me drive the car once alone. I have never driven to school on my own or to anywhere on my own. The last time I was able to drive the car on my own was when I drove to Quakertown and to the nockamixon park. But I knew that he still didn\u2019t trust me. Not only has phones and cars and being accused of other bullcrap nonsense, but my dad started putting cameras outside the house. One camera shows the view of the walkway to the door entrance and the driveway. The other cameras show the view of the driveway and the view of the entire lawn, including the private development road. My dad has also put more cameras inside\u2026 INSIDE the house!!!! I am freaking the hell out, I mean like I am scared to take a shower, to go to the bathroom, to sleep in my room, and to get dressed. I am scared and I am freaking out, checking every single goddamn day of my life to seeing if there's a hidden camera in the bathroom or in my room. My brother was going to college and also had a good job, he then started having depression when our mother just kept saying to us about how selfish and ungrateful kids we are. She kept repeating it over and over and kept threatening to kick him out of the house. Where he was living in NY. Because my brother was experiencing so much stress, and trauma, he was smoking at a young age because your entire body technically doesn\u2019t fully develop until you're 24 years old; especially your brain. And I am worried about my brother. The stress just kept getting worse, and my brother continued to smoke, so he decided to move out to a friend\u2019s house and lost his job and his car he bought. I am sick and worried about my own brother now. I don\u2019t know when I would ever get to see him and know if he is safe and healthy and if he is safe. I am only in PA because I had to finish my high school year of school, class of 2020. Even after my brother moved out, my mom continued to bring more stress but to me now. So recently, she had called me and started cursing me out and so I cursed her out and again she just kept repeating that I and my brother are the most selfish and the most ungrateful kids she has ever met in her entire life. She then told me that she wishes that she had never adopted us. So the word for word this is exactly what she said\u2026 \u201cWe saw the first picture of both of you and man I wish I had never adopted you, kids. Had I known that you both would be so selfish and ungrateful, I wish I would have never adopted you, kids. I wish I had just left you both in that horrendous place.\u201d So since she was living in NY, she came to PA and told me that if I am not happy then I should leave. I honestly did, but I don\u2019t know where to go because we live in the middle of nowhere where everything is like an hour or so away from you on foot. She got mad and started hitting me and told me to leave. I tried to leave, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. Instead, she tried to aggressively grab my clothes, like she was trying to take them off and told me that if I planned on leaving I had to go out fully naked. Because the clothes I am wearing are all hers. Because she had bought the clothes, and it belongs to her, not me. I had mentioned to my adopted mom about what she had said, about how she wishes that she had never adopted me and my brother, she then denies the fact that she did say it!!!! She said that I was making bullcrap up, even though I know for a fact she did say it. If the phone company allows you to hear people\u2019s conversation, the day they had a conversation, and when and at what time, I would literally show proof to anyone. Not only has she threatened to kick me out of the house without any clothes on, but my adopted mom also said that she won\u2019t support me for my college. She won\u2019t help pay for my college. I only have two more years of nursing school, and for the rest of my nursing years, I can pay off on my own. I just want to get the hell out of here and buy my own house, my own car, my own phone, and my own computer. I just want to have my own life where I can be happy and to see my brother again. I just want my brother to be safe and healthy and for both of us to be happy and free. I don\u2019t want to feel like a prisoner in a house. I don\u2019t want to feel or be treated like a criminal. I want to find a job, but I am not allowed to. I found a good babysitting\/nannying job that could pay me 1,000 but I wasn\u2019t allowed to have the job. Even if I did have a job, my dad won\u2019t take me. Also, my friends can\u2019t take me because they all went to college. All I need is a cheap car that would drive me to work, and I need a phone that would allow me to get in contact with anyone. I am in college, just not out of state. I live in Riegelsville rd on gallows hill rd. Can anyone please give me some suggestions? Anything, on how I can get the hell out and be free?","42":"I just wanted to tell somone that it's my birthday. I wanted to try this time.

TL;DR [My mom's a really horrible person and she ruined my life]As a bit of background, I am 14yo M Indian-American, and this isn't the regular case of strict parents and impossibly high expectations, although it does make it worse. My story begins about 11 years ago. During childbirth my mother died, which left my dad in a state of panic and a desperate need of a wife of whom I could call mom and love me the same. When I was 1 they married and began a life together. When I was 3 however, my mother twisted my arm (this was in Wisconsin at the time), this broke the bone and dislocated my arm. At the time I remember her look of anger and the ambulance I was loaded into. But alas, the journey only gets worse.It was when I was 5, did the abuse really start (we moved to India at the time), and it was all because of speculation. Put simply, I was watching Tom and Jerry on the sofa, and my mom was taking a shower. Now being the relatively okay person I am I ran over to the door to close it, out of courtesy, but just as I ran over to close it out of courtesy but my mom got dressed and almost walked out of the door before seeing me. She had thought that I was trying to catch a glimpse of her in the shower through a mirror in front of the door and was furious. At first, I began to explain but apparently because I ran away from her when she showed up at the door unexpectedly I was damned. I eventually (after hours of bashing, crying, and trying to tell her that U didn't do anything wrong) admitted that did indeed do it (even though I didn't) to stop the abuse, but naive me didn't realize the consequences.  For the rest of the day,  she choked me, stepped on my stomach, hit me and bashed my head on the walls and the furniture. She also made me sit out on the balcony for the rest of the day, not giving me a bite to eat. But before my dad came home, she wiped my face and sat me down on the couch to tell my dad that nothing had happened. And before someone gets skeptical as to why the neighbors didn't call the cops, I don't really know, all I know is that child abuse isn't taken very seriously in India, and corruption and bribes run rampant through the police force (at least that was my experience). The rest of the time after that is a mix, but from family accounts, I could piece together what had happened. Apparently, my dad was horrified when he found the bruising, blood, and stomach problems and began to yell at my mom. Then came court battles of which my mom \"defended\" herself by saying my dad had physically assaulted her and managed to throw my dad in Jail for days (hence the bribery and corruption), she also threatened to go to news media with her sack of lies she called a story. Eventually, they came to an agreement (I don't know how) and decided to stick together. But afterward, the doctors realized I had a problem and was sent into the ICU because her immense abuse crushed one of my intestines, and I wasn't able to eat anything otherwise I would cough up bile. I was hungry, stitched up to an IV, and barely anybody came to visit me. But the doctors came up with a fix, and I was out and healthy.The year after, some of my relatives on my deceased mom's side began contacting my dad, to tell him that I would be safer with them away from the abuse. For a few months, this was true until they decided not to give me back to my dad and didn't allow my dad to visit. Cue the arguments and yelling. Then after a giant family argument that distanced both the relatives on my true mom's side and the \"sack of lies\" mom's side. Then after precarious arguments, a little bit of minor physical abuse and hell of a lot of verbal and mental abuse. We land to where I am today. Please know, that even though she's terrible I never harbored any resentment, as I always wanted to think of her as my mom, the person I could love, and maybe get some back. My mom's relatives are also extremely nice and I hold great respect for my aunt, grandma, and grandpa on my mom's side. But I have always tried to be the best son. My mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, which makes her in constant pain. So I clean the house, bring her food even if she doesn't as for it, remind her to take her medication, and check-in with her every single day so that she can vent whatever she's feeling. And I always try to make her feel happy, whether it's cleaning something extra, doing something so that she doesn't have to do it, or spending part of my trip to Disneyland by helping her carry her bags and making sure she isn't cold, hungry or in pain. I'm not saying that I'm the best son, I'm truly not, but I do what I can and try to minimize my . . . \"screw-upness\"?  And I never expect a reward and mostly do things and don't even take credit for it or give the credit to my sister which makes my mom and her feel happy. But it all goes unnoticed or neglectedAnd now for more than the 6 years, I have been here in California I have undergone verbal abuse beyond measure. Things along the lines of, \"You should go die, we'll all be better off, maybe we'd cry for a few days but in the end, we will be happy\" or her infamous \"I've done so much for you, I gave you a mom to love and you disrespect me like this! I gave up having another child for you!\" or the one that hurts the most: \"You killed your mom, and if she saw you today she would kill herself again\". Other than that there are the smaller hints of you're not a worthy son, you do nothing for us and we do everything for you, you are the curse upon our lives. You hurt everyone you go near, and so on.There's really not a piece of writing that I could express all her insults but you get the point. All this really starts to take a toll, I have never been allowed to express my emotions as I'm either too young to be sad and stressed out, being angry is disrespectful and crying is weak. I have been suicidal since the age of 8 and frequently cut myself. But thanks to a couple of friends, I have started to self-heal, I don't cut as much anymore and try not to cry. I sit in my room awake just wondering \"Is it so wrong to ask for a mom\", \"mom, why did you have to leave\", \"I hope dad's alright, maybe I'm just a financial drain\". But I'm telling you that even though life sucks, worry about making today at least a little bit less sucky than yesterday and soon you'll heal. I didn't write this for pity or attention, if you look, this is my first post on Reddit. If you don't believe me then that's okay, please go about your day, I really don't have the energy to argue. And if you're still reading I thank you for listening to my story, and I hope your own gets a whole lot better. If you guys want to hear more about my life just ask, writing stuff makes me happy and I'd be happy to spill my feelings. - Person who cares.","44":"For context I am from India my mom started showing symptoms of covid from today 2 am and was hospitalised due to sickness. Still not sure entirely due to covid or allergies even so I'm terrified to think what might happen. Me &amp; my family ran our asses in the hospital today at Mumbai At Came hospital but the conditions there were so WORSE that we had to shift mom as she might get covid just by staying there. She was transferred to Hinduja Hospital which is much nicer than the one before at least in patient accommodation from my family's recommendations.

I'm scared outta my mind right now.Edit : I'll keep updating how things go.Oct 4, 10:43 pm: she sounded fine on the phone and the nurse Said she's good as well. Hopefully results show what's wrong with her.She's covid positive plus I'm also going to be undwr Quarantine for 2-3 weeks to see if I'm infected as well.Well shit.","45":"I am an Indian living in Australia. My parents moved back to India and I have no family where I live and my friends are absolutely s\\*it. They made fun of me for lower marks, calling me ugly, not being in a relationship. They use any personal information against me just for their satisfaction, the insecure f\\*cks. When I got an internship at a very good company, I got made fun of like how they needed to meet diversity quotas even though I competed against people of my same race. In public I have dealt with people threatening me and have gotten racist remarks when im just casually walking. I nearly cry everyday just alone in my home. I cant leave to visit my family due to COVID. Idk what to do. I hate my job and have nothing to do. I have been avoiding my s\\*itty friends. They came outside my house at 12am and stood outside for an hour, they stood outside for an hour when I was sleeping. I felt so unsafe when they did that (I was awake but pretended to be asleep). Then I get made fun of for wanting to avoid them. I tried blocking them but they just came to my house, demanding to know whySometimes I think that I will die alone. Idk what to do. I cry myself to sleep every night and try to hold it in when working.","46":"I'm 20years old, from India, I study BCA and I dont know a single line of coding. It doesnt interest me, I like playing video games but now a days i dont feel like to. I feel dead inside. No energy to do anything, smoking every second I can. Everybody around me is doing well and society tries to mock me in every way possible especially also my aunt, I have a joint family. For the past 2.5 years of college i did nothing but did my assignments and played videogames. Used to be a hard marijuana abuser, I'm clean now. I smoke occationally(once every month\/ 2months). My father is drowning in dept from my uncle and I can't help him. I always feel hot and burning and I feel like im going to die, physically and mentally. Apart from my father my grand mom and uncle aunt makes my mom do so much work, I feel sad. I help her whenever I can, she has spinal issues, always pain when she walks. She does it coz of my fathers dept, and my aunt is full of ego cuz her daughter is becoming a doctor and they're rich and We're not doing well. Me and my cousin we live in the same house but we barely see each others face,, she stays on the second floor, It feels like I'm a guest in my own house. My mom is my bestfriend but yet both my parents frequently laugh and joke about me clearing the dept. I'm not capable of handling this life thingy, I dont know if ever be able to make enough to feed myself but I want to see everyone happy. I dont feel like to play videogames which is my only way of feeling good. I feel dead inside, honestly I do :)","47":"Hi!I\u2019m Noreen Choudhri, clinical psychologist with 7+ years of experience (Owner &amp; Founder of Made in Mind,  Rajasthan, Jaipur, India)For my previous post ( on a different subreddit) I received so much of appreciation and response (also an award \ud83d\ude0a) which motivates me to do this.Based on the common complaints and strategies I have suggested people with mental health issues. I will be giving you one tip on a weekly basis that you can implement in your day to day life. Also try it for at least a week or 10 days consistently to see any improvements. It may work for some and may not work for others. Tip 1 STOP TRYING TO STOP OR CONTROL YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS It is not possible to stop or control your thoughts.A lot frustration stems from trying to control your thoughts.Thoughts  come and go. Trying to control what thoughts occur when, or trying to stop certain thoughts from happening altogether, is a poor use of your time and energy.Try this Experiment-  Try NOT to think of a PINK ELEPHANT, it actually makes it more likely that you will. It\u2019s called Ironic process theory, and refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface.What you can do or learn to do is accept that you can\u2019t control thoughts, develop the skill of observing mind-made activity (thought production) without getting caught up in it. With consistent practice, you\u2019ll discover for yourself that the content of your mind does not matter. What matters is how you let it affect you. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds floating across the sky: instead of getting lost in them, you can choose to watch them come and go.","48":"Hi everyone,I am a 11th standard student from India. For the last couple of months my mental health has not been upto Mark, it feels like I get rejected from every section of the society. No one cares about me or loves me, not even my parents. Yeah I know that some of you will say to me that, \"Your parents love you but you don't feel it\" but believe me it's not the case. They only love my older brother, it doesn't bother them what I like or what I want. Their love is in the ratio of 99:1 for me and my brother. I am left all alone, I love a girl and we both are in relationship but it has been on hold for last 4 months because of her studies and I don't want to disturb her. Nobody asks me \"how am I doing?\". My parents when in front of everyone behave with me nicely and when it comes to personal care and affection then they look towards my brother. You all might think that I am jealous of my brother, yeah that's true and this jealous has made me rebellious. I have the courage to suicide but if I suicide now then everyone will think that I took this step because of the girl with whom I am in relationship. I can't bear any more pain, I am tired. If anyone wants to talk to me on Instagram please DM on @kshitiz_psycho. I will be grateful if someone of you even ask about \"how am I doing?\". My so called friends also hurt me because when I tell them about my situation, they think that I am boasting off and taking emotional sympathy. Plzzz help me, I am \ud83d\udc94. Plzz DM me on instagram\ud83d\ude42","49":"I am a 21 y\/o girl from India. Gradually my life has sunk into its deepest pit. Ending this life seems a hopeful event. I live in a joint family and therefore at the receiving end of utmost oppression from family and community. My parents have gaslighted me since the day I was born. My family has criticized me, controlled me, and have gradually killed the person I was supposed to be. I don't know who I am. I was raped by a family friend for 3 years, sexually harassed from the age of 9. I asked them to take me to a therapist and they denied that I am depressed and told me to 'think positive'. My father has terrorized and emotionally abused me and my mother since forever, but denies it. Everybody denies things they did, and I do not know what is the truth anymore. They tell me what to wear, what to eat, who to talk to, when to go out, when to return, how to even use the toilet. I had to ask their permission to make a phone call at night, ask them if I can even cut my hair. Issues with my parents kept reflecting in my relationships and I currently about to lose my boyfriend because I have too many issues to cope and I show him the same terrorizing, mindfucking behaviour my parents do to me. I hate myself, I hate to look at my body. My family members have compared me to my friends and called me ugly infront of them, when I was already suffering from inferiority regarding my body. I have tried to reach out to my parents, my mom, but they deny, saying that I think too much. They blame me instead. Since they control everything, using the pandemic they now do not let me go out, or bring anyone home. I am here inside the perimeters of my house for 7 continual months. I cannot sneak out because my father has threatened me that if I by any chance come back with the virus, that will destroy our family and I will be responsible if anyone dies. It's bad in India. Then they even start scolding if I go downstairs without explaining or having a valid reason. I am inside these walls and then also I am not left alone. They constantly check what I am doing. And then my graduation exams are starting in 5 days and I have literally forgotten everything and I am trying so hard to sit with my studies but after 5 minutes I just can't. Either I cannot concentrate because I am just fucking mentally exhausted or they are constantly entering the room, moving things around, talking about stuff, regardless of what I am doing. I have no friends. I literally do not have anyone to communicate with. It has been like this for months. I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. I AM SO SUFFOCATED AND NUMB THAT DEATH SEEMS AN INTERESTING IDEA. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.","50":"I have perfect parents, perfect job, perfect boyfriend, and yet I feel no joy. I haven't lived a perfect life, I have seen my father's struggle with depression and have done as much as possible to educate myself about it. I am from India, we don't prioritize mental health here. Therapists are incredibly expensive and so hard to find. I have found one and have been talking to her for months, but something in me just doesnt trust her. It seems like I already know what ever she is talking about. I have a lot of insecurities, I always feel I am not enough and feel worthless pretty much all the time. People around me try to convince me otherwise but so far no one has succeeded. But with my therapist I suddenly have this superiority complex, I feel I know more than her and just don't pay heed to what she says. I know it is wrong but I cannot help it. Working is the only thing that helps me escape from feeling numb and worthless, I have pushed myself so much into it. For months I have been pulling off 90-100 hours of work every week. I work in a start up and I have deeply involved myself in so many projects that it's impossible for me to take a leave. I have an important exam coming up in a week ( to get into masters) and I have taken a week off to prepare which is adding to the pressure. I feel so sad numb and pressured all the time.Sorry for ranting here but I don't know who else to talk to about all this. People start worrying and suggesting things , no one gets it. They ask me to switch jobs, take vacations, go to therapy. I have tried doing all of this but my condition keeps deteriorating. I contemplate suicide but I know it's not an option for me. I don't want to make my mom sad. I don't want to take any meds, I am not sure about them, is there anything I can do to feel something? Even anger would do, just something.","51":" I have lived a mediocre life, with very big dreams. But now I realize that I have wasted my life and I am no close to achieving my dreams. I am an MBA for the top 15 institutes from India and yet I hear in interviews that I am unemployable.The truth is I don't exactly know what I want to do. I am currently devoid of any passion or dreams. And when I see my graduation classmates studying in Cambridge, Harvard, Princeton, etc. I feel I am an acute failure.I want to start over. But now I feel I am too old, wasted 10 prime years of my life doing nothing more than partying and dating. Now I hate myself for doing it and I no more socialize or date because of this guilt. I feel now my fate is sealed to be a mediocre failure in life. I don't know how to drive, swim, or how to code or any music instrument. I can't do anything and I feel like a burden living with my parents, I can't get out of bed with this thought in my mind, I have a constant headache thinking about my life.Can anyone help to know if someone can start afresh at 28? Or am I just too old to do anything?","52":"I'm 20. I belong to a middle class family. I like gaming. A lot. I practice aim trainers everyday. I stream too, but not very the best at it(gamesense wise). I used to play football, then cricket. Had to leave both because my father said it requires political influences to actually do anything in these field. I got myself into marijuana, a lot of it when I was in class 11. Fucked up my highschool results, but somehow got into college, I'm studying BCA now, 3rd year. I don't like to study at all. Bca doesn't interest me. Idk what interests me. I don't like codeing thats what I know. I cheat in exams. But I do my assignments on time. This is my everyday fucked up routine.. I wake up at 1pm. Have tea, game, have lunch, rest(this is when I'm writing this), Youtube\/aim training\/watch series (once in a bluemoon if I have assignments I do that), eat dinner, game till 5am(because my isp gives me a lot of packetloss when in the evening)\/sleep. My mother is sick and I have anxiety issues. I can only talk to my mom and my girlfriend. Ahh yes, I have a girlfriend whome I don't know if I love. She loves me, that's what she says.. but I don't feel that connection anymore, but I don't feel like to leave. It's a 4 year relationship. We don't talk much.. twice a day.. for 30mins max. We always tend to not agree on stuffs and fight. She wants me to understand whatever she says, if I don't, its usual emotional drama. If I leave, my parents are involved to get our asses back together, especially my mom. She likes her. But don't get me wrong.. she's a good girl..we have only sexual connection. I don't find anything else. Anyway..I smoke a lot. A lot.. of biris. A packet in 24hours but I don't do marijuana anymore.. it's like once every month\/a friend's birthday. I have tremors in both of my hands, I can't handle pressure of tournaments and pressure in general. I like building computers.. like linustechtips stuffs.. it's cool. Very interesting. Idk what to do for a living, nor I can talk to people. Like seriously. I stammer even if I go to a shop for asking a simple banana. Or to ask a price for something. I stammer hard. But I aim good. I'm in a clan.. I coach them here and there.. I tried to sell a coaching on fiver.. didn't work out. Nobody was interested on my coaching. I'm pretty good at it.. I've done my research. But yet.. my first business epic fail and so I continue to game. Everyday I say that I'll study, but I just can't seem to help myself. In India it's either engineer or doctor. Life is easy for beautiful girls..idc if they get offended because they do a 2lakh course on airline, get 60k pm. Don't get me wrong I'm happy for them. I saw 3 out of my 8 classmates (ratiowise) do this. Boys who were utter garbage than me in studies in school are doing well,by fighting.. working under local ministers, doing local grouping.. idk how to explain this but I hope u get it. Their father's are kinda rich ngl.. very in fact. One robbed my friend's dad legally! I got chances to get in contact do these, but I'm not this.. I believe I'm better than that.a I'm not complaining, but I'm sad for myself. I tried to take my life too.. but my mom is so cute, her face stops me but foremost I don't have the guts. I'm scared, lonley. So I go watch porn and masterbate. My life is miserable, and I don't know how to fix it. To give myself hope. Thank you my imaginary friends for your time.","53":"I have seen parents get mad at their children, but why is it always the African and Asian ones that get so aggressive and always want their children to be doctors or an engineer. I feel like parents don't care about what their kids strive to be. Does anyone have the same problem?","54":"Son, this is your father, everyone is talking about you in the family. We just saw your scorecard and we're really disappointed in you. It seems like you didn't study properly, you just wasted the money I spent on your studies. You even got more time to prepare due to covid19. Everything was in your favor and yet you've failed. So what if we constantly told you that you won't succeed, if you gave the exams just after traveling 200km, if you had to share your room with our favourite child(your elder brother), if he kept disturbing you by playing guitar and making noises, if we didn't care about your mental health, if we kept comparing your boards results to that of your brother, if we didn't listen to your complains about the disturbance a few months ago, if your brother ruined your sleeping routine by playing guitar at night? You are totally responsible for the results. You were the one running away from studies, don't blame it one the situation, you don't have the willpower to fight the situation. We'll keep reminding you how much you disappointed us till you get depressed, but will be pseudo understanding and tell you the results don't matter. We'll compare your score with your friends' , but doesn't mean you're weaker than them. We'll tell you that you've failed in a life deciding exam, but it doesn't mean you're life is useless. We'll tell you that you don't have the potential to do anything, but that doesn't mean we mean it. We'll push you to the edge of depression but refused to agree that we didn't do the best parenting. We'll give you as much as mental stress as we can but that should motivate you. We'll mock you day and night for your score but that is just motivation through demotivation. At the end, when you decide to let go of everything, when you decide that you can't take it anymore,when you're writing everything that has pushed you so deep into depression, when you thinking about everyone that supported you , your friends and lover, when you're standing on that chair thinking about the end, when you push the chair, the chair hits the floor but you don't.We'll be sad, we'll be sad that you were worried about non existing problems, we'll be sad that you we're ungrateful of all the things we gave you, all the love, we showed you all the love and support but still you left, you were too selfish, you just thought about yourself, there was a happy life ahead of you, you never even gave a thought about how sad we'll feel if you're gone, you didn't even think about your friends, you were just a fool, you threw mud on the family, now we'll tell everyone that you were mentally ill due to personal reasons, we had no part in it, you always let us down, this time too, we're really disappointed in you...Thanks guys,if you read the story till the end. It happens to most of the students(mostly non favourite child) who commit suicide in India. This has happened to me twice but I used to secretly buy \"happiness pills\". And it is happening again and since I'm at home, I can't get the meds without anyone noticing. I am not suicidal btw but many of my friends are due to the same reasons. Depression is seen as something that losers get so students don't see any therapist. 20+ students committed suicide this year due to the JEE exams(which I also appeared for) and the results declared today so many more will do that. It's just a college entrance exam but Indian parents make it a do or die(quite literally) exams. Thanks again. Don't mind the typos, if any","55":"Hello y\u2019all.. I am a 30 year old house wife with three kids living in the USA from the last 7 years. When I came here it was all new to me.. the country,the poeple,the weather,the food, the adjustments and the amusements. I was born and brought up in the southern part of India and was a youngest child In the family overly attached to my parents. Fast forward 2020.. my parents are getting old by the day and even cooking and taking care of themselves is getting very hard  for them when they fall sick. I have been thinking about ways And wishing to keep my parents here in the USA with me and my sister. It\u2019s So beyond stressful for me and I am depressed round the clock that I am not able to help my own parents and be with them when they need me. I was born and brought up there ,now whenever I visit India I fall sick.. like seriously sick with the flu and Diarrhea and the vomitings. My children fall severely sick with us ending up doing hospital visits every other day when we visit. So under these circumstances it\u2019s not possible for me to take my kids and go Stay there and Take care of them.. all I ask here is to please guide me a way to keep my parents with me.. I want nothing more in this world than my parents staying with me.. why is the backlog of just the ones born in India is happening??? Why are we so invisible?? I am just as human as anybody of you.. when will this nightmare and depression end for me?? Is there light at the end of the tunnel?? Coz I am really lost and would just want all of this suffering and pain to end..!!! P.s those who have mean things to say can Shut the F up and move on..!!","56":"(I'm not looking for any moral support or anything. I just wanted a space where I can keep this whole thing a secret but recorded so when and if I'm gone, someone could find it cuz I'm be deleting this letter from the email. If the moderators think of deleting this, I'd find a different place to store this of not here. I just ask you to make at least this easy in my life.)Hi,This will be a copy paste text as I may not be strong enough to share everything all over again. This is my second attempt at this. I couldn't do it the first time.Anyway, I'm suffering from depression from past 3 years. Actually, I have had several episodes throughout my childhood due to bullying in school and College. But it got worse after I graduated. My parents (mom, especially) treated me like trash because I couldn't land on a job. Really changed my perspective on everything. I felt my worth is nothing to anyone. I grew up in a poor family and my parents being the way they are, isn't their fault anyway. But all these sudden responsibilities (I have 2 younger sisters and I'm an India. So you can imagine what I mean) put over my head, is just too much. All things I wanted to achieve while I was college were vanishing right in front of me. The realisation that I'd never get to live the life I dreamt of, is really messing up my life.What's all these about? What's the point if I'm never able to achieve my dreams? Why can't I just run far away and live for myself? What's the point of living like this if I'm never going to be alright about my career or life itself? What's the point of living if I know I'm never going to be happy?I can just jump off a building or breathe nitrogen gas and never have to worry about being sad or depressed again. When I'm thinking about suicide, I'm never scared of not being happy again. But I'm always scared of getting hurt again.I request you to not ask me what my dream is our discuss a way to fulfill or achieve it. I have already discussed it a billion times to every single person I have shared about my depression. Yeah, there's a chance that I might achieve them. But it'd take me YEARS to do it. I'm not capable of hold up myself for so long. I don't want to wait for so many years. I want to be happy now. I want to not feel depressed again. I wish we were mindless creatures rather than to deal with all these emotional drama ( I wanna say emotional roller coaster but mines just a downward spiral).My job? I'm a customer service chat agent. I have done handful of jobs throughout my life (I'm 24 now), but this job is the worst. I wake up everyday worrying about what kind of customer I'd have to deal with today. I've imagined myself smashing my head on keyboard or ripping my laptop into 2 and getting electrocuted or bleed out to death from my head injury. But I never physically harmed myself.If the information is necessary: I'm a dude living in Bangalore. I'm nihilistic atheist, tryna live as long as I can deal with this meaningless life. I'm doing this cuz my close friend insisted me to try this out. I'm not saying i don't trust in therapy. I'm just saying, surrounded by so much negativity while doing THIS job, this text based therapy wouldn't be much helpful.I want to thank you and the whole team for doing all these and for free of cost. I wish each and everyone of you live a happy life with your loved ones around you. I wish you never have to face any major struggle in your life.Regards,Someone who shouldn't have been dead.Thanks for reading.","57":"Ever since COVID happened I haven't been able to move outside my home . Especially because of living in a country like India where the entire government is full of scam artists pretending to solve the problem in a few days. The number of cases where I live is at it's **peak.** &gt;I have felt I always had 2 sides an introvert  quiet ,calm side and a wild side that needs freedom more than anything else. Living in the same room without being able to experience the sunshine or experience the smell of the rain or walking pon the road has me completely shattered mentally.Moreover ,I realize *playing video games* or *watching Netflix* all day long isn't gonns fix that rather it is gonna aggravate that.I have also tried to distract myself using the above techniques that just not help at all.**Also I do not have any friend's at alll**.I have never been  the person who has had group of friends. Due to my multiple interests I have kinda mixed along with multiple sets of groups often not wanting to chose one group. However, this has left me isolated most of the time since I feel in the end I don't have someone to talk to or anyone to actually hang out with. This is really aggravayed by COVID again because the people whom I used to talk to no longer talk with me at all and also due to different schedules.**I feel like I'm in a loop** . Just wake up eat , question life , feel sorry and wish COVID goes away and sleep.**I have gained 10 kgs** of weight and **injured my leg doing these stupid home workouts** which are not as effective as actual workouts in an actual gym .I miss the gym dearly.Feel like shit carrying that weight around and not being able to workout properly or visit a doctor because these fucking doctors mis-treat patients too.I cannot handle my stupid parents . **They just cannot seem to understand that depression is real** and my relationship with them is extremely toxic although there is no love lost , there is no compatibility at all. I feel like I'm trapped at home with people who just don't understand me and do not value mental health and think of it as just another attention.&amp;#x200B;I do not feel like coding at all. I just don't feel like learning anything at all. I wish I could have a gap year where I could pursue what I wanted. **Also being forced to enter into a Masters program because of leaving the country is a much better alternative than living somewhere you are just treated as fucking statistic.**  I fucking hate my country . I hate the people here and the mindset of the people.  I hate my fucking unversity which is a big scam. I feel like I want to droput and pursue something related to coding or maybe artisitic on my own but this degree and parents won't ever support or accept the fact that I could do something other than CS.**I just do not feel like eating , or doing anything. I feel extremely depressed.**&gt;All my life I have never been able to be around people who share a similar mindset to me and have extremely different interests and passionate about them . All people seem to care about are grades and nothing remotely related to humans or actually. I just feel I wish I had chosen a better university where I had people who wanted to pursue something related to research. However ,this scam of a country does not promote research among undergrads as well. The only people able to pursue this are for the Tier 1 ,2 unis where the profs actually know some shit. This shitty university of mine is forcing to sit for placements into mass recruiting company's and try going to FAANG. Fuck I do not want to become an SDE . I wish I could do something remotedly related to original research. All the research they seem to know is copy paste from google  ,bribe recruiteres and conference judges for paper acceptances. Which feels like a **big scam.**I have absolutely no motivation left whatsoever . I wish COVID goes away and I can heal both physically and mentally . I just cannot seem to work despite knowing the problems I could face for not acting whatever I have planned out.","58":"So I was diagnosed with clinical depression on March of this year. I have been on medications since then which helped me a lot and get back on track.I can still tell those few months were hell (October 2019 till now when I have depression relapse). I am consulting a psychologist (female) and psychiatrist (male) both are quite understanding and well aware. I have absolutely no complaints from them. On the start of this year, a medical specialist wrongly diagnosed me with hypothyroidism and prescribed me medicines. After which I started consulting my psychiatrist who said that I don't have hypothyroidism and stopped the medication for thyroid. I took the medicines for 8-10 days which messed up my hormone levels. Then the psychiatrist doubted that I may have hyperthyroidism but didn't prescibe me any medicines. I had to give blood samples multiple times with an interval of 6 weeks. This time the doctor is still confused and told me to do Ultrasound.My point is that I have to consult other doctors besides psychiatrist due to many reasons.Often I have to face their judgemental looks and insensitive words when they see my past reports and medications. I am not the confrontation type of person so I say nothing. But it clearly bothers me. I understand that India is not \"educated enough about mental illness\" but being a doctor doesn't give them the right to judge me. It hurts me a lot and makes me furious. It makes me doubt myself and all the struggle I had to go through and still have to. It messes with my mind. It triggers me and reminds me of the times when I have really depressed and couldn't tell anyone because of the fear of not being understood.  Their way of speaking and words make me thinks that it's my fault.I can't even say anything to them as those men( I have only experienced this with male doctors, I am not gender stereotyping at all) have fragile egos and I don't have the guts.","59":"I'm 17M.COVID helped me realize that people who appeared to be my friends don't mind if I exist or not. I've tried approaching them but I've either been ghosted or messaged like a stranger. Every time, I am the person who starts the conversation. I know there's nothing wrong with that but if a person calls you their friend then it is kind of obvious that any person in that friendship can message to the other side.People who I believed and who I talked with are not able to find even a minute out of their week to message me.  Before quarantine times they declared our group of friends as 'family'.I've always been the 'funny' guy of the group, and just like in the memes as the funny guys are depicted of being depressed within their heads, the same situation exists in my life.There are about 2-3 people who I'd considered to be my bestfriends, but they proved their relationship with me as otherwise. None of them care. None.Often, when there is some kind of work or support they need, for example, an emotional support, they mention it when I've messaged them, they talk to me, and when I ask details (just to listen not even suggest any solution because I know they'll find their way out of that problem on their own, they are smart and mature enough for that) they say that its personal and I can't ask any questions about that. Some of them tell me that they love me, but I know that is to maintain the confidentiality of the content they told me about. I've tried to believe otherwise too, that maybe I'm just overthinking, but in that case their actions proves that wrong every time. I am treated as an audio diary basically. In terms of work, I do it and if they ask for it I share, and that's that no further talk.I come to realize that being resourceful and funny can be a curse, so to get rid of it I've cut myself from everybody. Since a month I haven't messaged any single one of them, I find them online on social media and successfully resist the urge to message them. I share memes but again I'm either ghosted or just message a 'haha' text or so. Those people are smart enough to understand that if I'm memeing a lot I am not feeling good and I'm searching an escape from reality, but then again the point that they just don't care about me is proved.So, I don't have any friends.As far as family goes, I have a mother who loves me but when I make the slightest of mistake she ends up supporting my physically abusive father who has been beating me up since I was 10. He says 'when you'll get to face the harsh realities of the world after you become an adult, my beatings will seem like a gesture of blessing to you, and you will thank me that I put sense into your brain.' But I genuinely think that its affecting me otherwise.I don't feel like studying anymore, but if I don't study then my father would do what he does even more because he wants a full utilization of the money he had invested in me. For him, earning money and providing it for me and my sibling is ultimate parenting, because love and social growth is the kind of thing that mothers are supposed to do.I am somewhat talented, I can learn skills on an incredibly fast pace and I have proved it many times, but I've been told by my father that my talents have no value in the world and only marks (he doesn't ever say education but marks) are the only way to success.I am smart too, my favorite subject is Math and I am good at it but as I told just now, I don't feel like studying.Because of all this, I am lazy, fat, depressed, irritated and angered all the time.All of this used to happen before COVID too, but as the conditions have become worse and so is my life.I've lost all motivation to do anything, and everything I dream of achieving is either disapproved by my father or it just seems too far fetched.Whenever I try to distract myself from depressing feelings, I try to use social media but my parents think that I'm constantly chatting with someone and they'll be a bad influence as they assume any stranger in this world to be. This is the reason I'm scared to put this post up too.I am somewhat suicidal but I'm also scared of dying, just like I'm scared of every little thing in this world. I get suicidal thoughts, but as soon as that thought comes to my mind I feel like the reason that such thoughts occur to me is just my fault and I have to deal with it somehow, even if its somebody else's fault in reality.I feel like I should just approach my grandparents (maternal side) who are financially and socially stronger who I really love a lot, more than anybody, but they also have a busy life because they have other children and grandchildren apart from my mother and me respectively. My paternal side grandparents are just an older version of my father, who want to hit me but won't because their bodies ache due to aging.I'm from India.Whatever I just told has been going on since 5-7 years. Which is about 30-40% of my lifetime until now.I can't go to a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor or any such aid because in our country millennials and boomers think that such things are only meant 'mentally disabled' people and not for 'respectable' people (even though I have no respect anywhere). I cannot call any helpline number (if it exists, I mean, I don't know if it does exist) because anything related to a mental illness is just fiction for people around me.I don't know what to do.I want to get active and get thin while my education goes on so that my body can produce whatever happy chemical it is supposed to produce so that I don't continue to feel and exist like I do.But like I said, I have no motivation .This is my first post on Reddit and I thank God that I was able to join a community online where I can open up and just blabber about whatever shit is going on, anonymously.","60":"I am just having the worst day. The whole week has been stressful, but Today I just broke down. I can't take it anymore. My grandma was hospitalized last week, she came back yesterday, but has lost her sanity to an extent. My whole family is showing flu symptoms and my dad got tested for covid today. Results are yet to come. There are some bitchy relatives who are being pain in the asses(I'm from India). And I finally gathered the strength to get some work done and send some mails, turns out my laptop isn't working. I feel exhausted. As if, anything I touch next will blow up too. My mind cannot rest, and physically I can't work. I talked to a friend and broke down in front of her too, yet I could say everything I wanted too. I couldn't let it out. I wish I could sleep, and wake up only when this is all over. I just want to be done. I want to feel normal for once.","61":"I need help to cure my depression. I've been depressed since 3 years now. It is causing some panic attacks and sleepless nights now. Since I am a college student, I have no money. My parents are conservative and do not understand depression. Hence I was looking for some free ways to cure depression. If there is a website or an email or anything at all to offer help, please put it down below. Also anybody else who has got over depression without professional help can also share their story. Have a great day guys!","62":"I am a nobody living with parents in their house. Since the pandemic started I feel very disconnected I knew that I am introvert but still I feel low all the time. I don't feel like doing anything like not even drinking sufficient water or having food. I have no friends, I am getting irritated by everything anyone does to me, for this, I am barring them to talk to me. I feel like I am just a burden to my family. I am a college student so I do stress about getting a decent job. Moreover, I live in India, no one absolutely no one will understand that there exist mental illness like anxiety or depression.  I can't seek professional help because of the pandemic. I did an online psychometry test to check if anything was wrong with me but it shows that I am extremely depressed. I don't know what to do next. I am not suicidal but I won't be unhappy if I die.","63":"Hey guys.I'm (18M) going to get straight to the point. I'm from India, at university in the US. I'm doing fairly well in school, i'm fairly fit and love exercising. I also have a two 'close' university friends, a bunch of other casual ones and my old highschool friends back home. My problem? I've never been in a romantic relationship. Never. Not one girl has ever taken interest in me. Sure,  I talk to them, and a few are quite close as friends, but I've never been in an actual relationship. All of my friends are in one, and while I'm extremely happy for them and they are quite supportive of me, I feel worthless. I'm never going to be good enough. Recently my 23 year old friend proposed to his partner, and again, I'm really happy for him, but at the same time, I feel like I will never get to experience what he is. Add on to this the fact that my parents are somewhat stereotypical indians, and I don't know I will have their support or if they even want to see me get together with someone (this probably isnt true; my mom actually asked me a few times if I got a girlfriend). I know I probably sound like an edgy teen or that this issue is trivial or very common, and that things will get better. This probably isn't even real depression right? I'm sorry if I misused that word. Past few weeks, this realization and feeling of being absolutely worthless to anyone as anything but a fucking resource or means to get work done has been fucking with my head hard (this probably isn't even true, but the scenarios just keep going on in my head and this is my current mindset). I'm probably just blaming my inability to get someone on my parents. I've cried alone in my room multiple times and I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy. I'm fucking lost. Maybe its just quarantine? I know a lot of you will tell me to put myself out there, and I've already done that. Hell, I'm an active in three different clubs and in a fraternity with a ton of good guys.Just yesterday I jokingly said to myself that if I killed myself then my thoughts would stop going haywire, and only after a moment did I realize the severity of what I just said. I don't know what's going to happen. Please, if you have any words of advice or anything I can do, let me know.&amp;#x200B;Take care,A","64":"Well I live in India, Mumbai specifically. If anyone wishes to be friends. My doors are open. I want to real friends.","65":"I think I'm going into major depression that I've been ignoring for a long time without realising it. I don't feel good about things I usually enjoyed. I don't get good sleep (usually experiencing certain nightmares about things a normal person won't even care about. Like I feel bad about saying things that may or may not have affected others but have started to part away from me. My gaming friends that I don't even know personally have started parting ways from me and gaming was something I truly loved and enjoyed spending my time. I thought losing contact and deleting them is the best way I can find peace and not be treated like shit.) I don't eat well (basically loss of appetite). I've stopped enjoying food. My professional life has taken a toss for over a year and half now. I'm not finding a job that I would truly enjoy and been rejected over and over again for certain gap in my work experience. I have I've come to a point that I have started questioning my existence. I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate or remember sometimes, when my brain is a memory tank. I could remember any good or bad conversations I've had with any person if I want to. With that sometimes I feel it's a curse because I can't let things go and the stupid memory keeps haunting me. I'm a very simple man. I come from India and such a thing is usually laughed at and taken as a joke. I hope I can find some answers and suggestions that can help me lift up. Thank you.","66":"I fear to talk to people. I fear to look in people's eyes. I am a introvert. I never talk to girls. If I did my body gets heated up, heart rate increases. I never make casual conversations. I have few friends at school. I seek attention. I get angry if my parent say about my probleem with not talking to anyone. They're worried about me not greeting my relatives our cousins. I only care for three persons in my life - my sister, mother and father. I desire to love alone in island. I desire peaceful happy family life in abroad too.People always complain about my behaviour. Teachers nor the students respect me. Classmates bully me. Sometimes teachers bully me\/or be hurtful. I sleep in most of the classes since I the lessons do not interest me. I am a average student. Did very good in studies expect for few years, after need for socializing increased and people were no more kids. I spent time after school thinking about what happened in school, though I will not to care. I feel to escape a social interaction or conversation without my control. I have symptoms for autism and adhd. my father advised me not to confuse my mind with things that I'm not sure of. We are consulting a physcolgist this week. I have no friends I can hang out with. I don't leave my house, expect for going to school, shop,..etc. Few people donot find value in my friendship so consider me as a good person they know well. No best friends. Been in some troubles last year trying to get attention, get fame, talk to people and girls. I act like a normal person. No one knows I have these bla bla bla. The think I am a silent introvert. I talk good to male friends. I have no one other than my family I can trust. I feel like people don't care for people like me. My parents always say I have huge potential. I am good at many things my class mates are not. I lack long-term concentration memory. I have no relationship. I donot find any other purpose to live other than my dreams of future. My parents be negative half of the time. The make me cry. I don't cry in front of them. I am very sensitive. I have no talents. Tried a lot and spent a lot to discover and still trying many different things. Due to COVID-19 obsessed with subreddits on dimensional jumping,astral projection to change past and present. I look ugly with asymetic face, one eye below than other, scar beneath my eyebrow. Most people get scares at me. After they get used to mr, they come know I am no harm and they ignore me. Every babies I have ever met get scares at me as of my knowledge. I am also very much dark. I am currently not worked about good future but peaceful life. I started to meditate. But cannot escape reality.love to watch movies and series all day. I'm so much lazy. Though I'm tall(6ft) I am not good at sports. I donot have balance, and the sports masters in schools were demotivating me that hurts. After solitary in Quarantine, I started to wank off daily. My sexual desire was always high, but always got demotivated thay I can never be with someone.I wish I go some other place after I'm 18. I have huge dreams, but I am okay with medicore job with good house some where in good country like US and enough money to buy me what I want. The situation I mentioned above may be conflicting because I be a different person at different places. I am afraid and donot talk about my social life or friends before my parents. Hided my social media from them. Quit Instagram a month ago since o made feel lower than others. I am afraid to have anyone I know in my house. I am afraid of my parents to see me talking to someone. I don't know why.i hide everything to my parents, until there was so much necessary to tell. I am from India. I have week genes prone to diabetes, thyroid and cancer. I donot exercise as I am too lazy. But I am very intelligent and good at problem solving, maths. I like science but bored my defenitions and derivations. I will not die, I am not a coward. I just want to pass this stage so I can get freedom and peace one day.There was no tldr, since those were glimpses of my life. Thankyou if you read. Felt better sharing this . Love you all.","67":"I'm a 25-year-old (M) from India. I have social anxiety and depression (not diagnosed, I've never seen a psychologist since we don't have much access to mental health facilities here). But I find it hard to fall asleep at night because of my overactive imagination and wake up often even after managing to fall asleep. I used fo enjoy travelling alone before the pandemic as it was the only thing in the world that made me feel something. I don't feel any connection with anyone in my family as I know they don't really understand me at all. I have never had the courage to ask anyone out because I feel I'm not worthy of love. I've never been with a woman. I think I go searching for love in all the wrong places. Now I just bottle up all my feelings because there's not a single person in this world who knows me or would want to. Every day is a struggle and everything hurts. I can't get anything done because I'm either lost in negative thoughts or having a panic attack. I used to hope that things are going to change one day, but it only seems to be getting worse. I'm not suicidal but every time I go to sleep, I wish I never wake up again. If there's anyone out there who understands this, at least know you're not alone.","68":"I read the following article today and I thought it might appeal to the people here.https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.outlookindia.com\/blog\/amp\/india-news-seemingly-happiest-people-often-suffer-from-depression\/4156","69":"I (16M) currently live in India with my father, step-mother and elder sister. I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my \"beliefs\" to myself and don't tell them about it. A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (slaves). Please help me. What the hell should I do?","70":"I\u2019ve become an alcoholic. I used to drink just on weekends but now I\u2019ve started drinking everyday. I just can\u2019t sleep without alcohol. I\u2019m 25, I have a okayish job and a girlfriend who doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m bi and she thinks I\u2019m a monogamous man. It all feels to much. Alcohol is the only escape I find. I don\u2019t want to be a drunkard and drink my life away. It all started from bullying in school to college and at work place. I feel I\u2019m not good enough for anything. People around me always fed me that I\u2019m inferior. The inferiority complex has taken a toll on my physical and mental health since school. There are no psychiatrist available here in India. The ones available charge a fee that nobody can afford. I can\u2019t talk to my parents they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through. Every day is a battle I\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m stuck and I can\u2019t get outta it.

Being the youngest of all the family members I was the one getting bullied by  my own family member.My family loved me so much that they caged me down in my own house knowing there is no escape I started to have fun in the house when one Sunday evening when I was having a gala time with my siblings, my father heard me laugh and play so loud that he decided to barge in the room smake me with his slippers and told \"YOU ARE NOT A GIRL YOU SHOULD NOT LAUGH SO MUCH\". Leading me in becoming who I am today who can't express his feeling to anyone neither know what I feel... Becoming a introvert and growing internal hate for all humans...Well if you are a dad and reading this I hope you let your kids laugh have fun as much as they like because that's the only time they can do what they feel is fun, don't be harsh on them let them grow in there own creative way.","72":"I am a final year law student in a student loan of 800 dollars.

I was literally bullied entirety of my school life and bc both my mum and dad used to go to work they never had time to listen to me or my brother. I've been depressed since I don't even know and i recently a doc told me i also have ADHD. When i was a kid the only thing my parents ever spent on was our education and nothing else. I didn't had toys or anything, i wasn't allowed to go outta house, even packed chips and stuff weren't allowed. I remember how my father treated my elder brother.. he used to beat him for low marks in school and many other stuff which is harder to explain. We were never taught any manners or any kinda stuff, bc my parents were busy with their work they never thought of asking their child if they're okay or not or even teaching something good. They always expected from us that we suppose to know everything. Even when my brother was suffering from stage 3 brain cancer and was in stroke paralysis my dad treated him like shit. I used to think that my dad has work pressure that's why he's abusive and all but when my brother had cancer my father was retired so i still don't know why he treated my elder brother like shit (my bro died aug 2018). Last year around may i had a severe panic attack where i was literally choking and unable to breath bc i also have hypertension, it happened in front of my parents and when i was stable after like half hour later i told my parents \"i think we should go see our doc\" and they said \"you're on meds, it's your fault if something happening to you\". I suffer from anxiety disorder and panic attack prob alongside multiple other mental illnesses and this is where \"parents should be treated like gods\" and emotions and stuff comes... I always want to believe that you know, my parents do their absolute best According to whatever knowledge they have about parenting but still the way my father used to abuse us is still unjustified. My father wants to me live a life he have thought about. My mom's a lil good though, she cooks me delicious food and stuff but she also expects me to do everything on my own which is too much for my mental health. It's just miserable here. I still care there are still emotions bc maybe I'm raised like that but still my mind says what's wrong is wrong. I have some good friends that keeps me alive i guess. This whole \"parents are god\" this is a mess in India and it's just too much on a childs fkin' mental health. I wish i could be more practical bc I can't focus on myself. My parents are 60+ so I'm automatically supposed to help them even if they didn't help me when i was a child. Any advice is helpful, thanks. Life's just too much depressing!","74":"Hey guys. i guess right now i\u2019m just going through the motions. i\u2019m alright, but not really. i guess i\u2019m just tired, i feel like i\u2019ve been through enough, and i know my trauma is nowhere as bad as what others have gone through, it has definitely taken a toll over the years.as a kid, i was molested, bullied, abused, and my already pre-existing mental health conditions got worse. but i stuck through it, and made it to high school.high school was the darkest time of my life. i was raped and this put me in a really dark place. i was very suicidal my sophomore year. i was also being groomed by pedos, and hurt a lot by people. my eating disorder got worse, and i self harmed a lot. my physical health was also taking a toll. i still have a messed up stomach and occasional fainting spells to this day. i was on every medication in the book, and that just made everything crazy. i was home instructed most of my sophomore and junior year, and pulled everything together my senior year, somehow graduated, and then went to college. when it came to friends, i do have friends, but after high school, i wanted to distance myself as much as possible from high school. even my senior year, i kept bailing on all these people that did care about me, something i still regret.i was really optimistic about college. everyone told me it was a new beginning, and a fresh start. and, my first year, was terrible. my college orientation was terrible since for some reason, my schedule was a mess and i had to get so much shit fixed. but i was still optimistic. when i moved into my dorm, i realized one of my roommates was kinda crazy. just not someone i really vibed with, which is fine, but it started affecting my mental health when random people would come into our room at 2 am, constant drug deals happening in our room, and when she told me about her eating disorder. this triggered mine and so mine got worse. i told a mutual friend about the situation, who i thought knew about her eating disorder, and basically got into a lot of drama with my roommate. i really shouldn\u2019t have told our mutual friend, and instead maybe an RA, but my dumbass just wasn\u2019t thinking. while there was all this roommate drama going on, i met my now-ex. and this asshole, i swear to god. in the beginning of our relationship, when we were getting to know each other, he never respected my boundaries, but my dumbass didn\u2019t want to say no, because i was head over heels for him. and it makes me mad. i started coming to my senses, and wanted to break it off, but then, i found out about my grandfather. my mom told me that my grandfather, who at the time lived in india, was very sick all of the sudden. i was very confused because literally before college started, he was fine. i talked to him on the phone and he was fine. also, this was around mid-october. and so i hung onto my ex because i felt like i had no one. i didn\u2019t really make a ton of friends in the beginning because i was so stressed about pre-med and classes and stuff. the ones i did make, i kind of got out of touch with at that time, and only spent time with him. eventually i moved in with him, and i kept ignoring every red flag.my grandfather passed away late october. my parents had to go to india without me because i had exams that week, and i couldn\u2019t even say goodbye. he passed away from cancer. this was the first close relative i lost, and it broke me. i stopped eating, i barely could go to class, i barely slept. the only person i talked to was my ex. all i did was lay in bed. i passed out during one of my labs, because i didn\u2019t eat that whole day. it was just such a mess. a week after i found out, my ex decided to come back home drunk, and i was so worried, and stayed up until 4 am taking care of him. i remember ordering him food, going downstairs in the cold at 2 am just for him. the week after that, he allegedly cheated on me. i say allegedly because i\u2019m not 100% sure, but essentially, i saw texts between him and some girl. that weekend was veterans day weekend, and i went home to spend sometime with my family. the one weekend i was gone, he cheated. his excuse is he felt hungover and he needed weed, and his only way to get weed was to have this girl over and smoke some of hers. i obviously didn\u2019t believe it, but i just could not accept the fact he could cheat on me. and, i couldn\u2019t go back to my dorm. i was too dependent on him, and i knew i had no where else to go. he knew that. we argued a lot throughout our relationship. he was a big dude too, and he was very aggressive. it was a bad situation, but i just sorta accepted it. by the time exams came around, i pulled myself together and finally went home for winter break. honestly, things got a lot better in january. i realized that friends are important, and those friends that i cut out for all these extraneous reasons (such as a toxic person that is friends with all of them) are stupid, and these people care about me. i got back in touch with my high school friends, and made more college friends. things got worse and worse with my ex. he was very emotionally manipulative. as soon as i decided to leave, he would cry and say he would not be able to live without me. just emotionally manipulative stuff like that. i also had this one friend who was just very toxic but i didn\u2019t really realize it. she put a lot of her stresses on me, and expected me to fix them. valentine\u2019s day came around. he didn\u2019t do anything for me. i know that it isn\u2019t a competition, but for his bday\/christmas, i went all out and got him something special and made him something. on v-day, i had 2 exams, first one at 7:30 am and i still wrote him a little note. that\u2019s honestly all i wanted, a letter, a note, a cute drawing. anything. but he didn\u2019t do anything for me, and it hurt. in march, because of quarantine, i had to go home. my ex helped me move out of my dorm, since my parents at the time didn\u2019t know i was living with him. he met my mom and dad. oh and two days later, he stole money from me. call me a dumbass, because i was very dumb for doing this, but i left my card on his phone. and i forgot he had access to it. i\u2019ll be honest, in all my previous \u201crelationships,\u201d money was never an issue. he was the first guy that actually made money a factor in our relationship.initially, we were going to split everything. this guy i went out with before him would pay for everything. personally i never liked it. i was totally okay with splitting, but i chipped in more than him. he basically said that his parents weren\u2019t giving him the money he needed. and his excuse for not having a job is that he said his parents would not let him. i know, a very dumb excuse. around november, i let him use my card whenever i didn\u2019t want to go get groceries. that\u2019s how he had it. over the course of a month, he stole 300 dollars. and lied about everything. i feel stupid, all i ever did was love and care about him. my friendships aren\u2019t super strong, but i\u2019m building them. my GPA isn\u2019t the best, but i\u2019m bringing that up too. i feel shitty, but i\u2019m trying my goddamn best. and this is what i\u2019m tired of. why doesn\u2019t it get better? i feel like i\u2019ve had it hard enough already, but there\u2019s always something that happens. someone hurts me. someone i trust is fake. and it\u2019s so frustrating. it\u2019s struggle after struggle, and i don\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel. i don\u2019t even know if there is one. thanks for reading guys, i know this was very long. TL;DR: i\u2019ve had a lot of trauma in my life, and even when college was supposed to be my fresh start, it doesn\u2019t feel like it is. things are a little better, but still just as hard.","75":"I (16M) currently live in India with my father, step-mother and elder sister. I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning) and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share feelings with (and they do all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (slaves). Please help me. What the hell should I do?","76":"Where should i start exactly? On the fact that i don't value life anymore? Or  the issue on how pathetic i am?I never really understood why people would want to kill themselves before. But recently i finally understood what it feels like to be on their shoes. And that's why i feel so pathetic, and weak. Lately i thought about my life a lot, my past, present, and the hopeless future. And suddenly i found no value in life anymore! I am making this post because i want to organize my thoughts. I want to know what exactly is wrong with me. This may be a bit long but i hope you guys can finish it for me.I have never enjoyed my life as long as i remember. I came from a poor family so i never had the things i wanted since childhood. I remember myself always envying others, and i started loosing interest in hanging out with friends because of it. I also am a sole child so my loner life already began during my childhood. At grade 6, i entered a central boarding school, against my will because we deeply fear boarding schools here. But my parents want me to enter it because of the free education. The name of the institution was JNV. There was a lot of ragging there, and the second saturday of the month was always what i spend the rest of the month thinking about, it was parents visiting day. And that was the only thing i find it worth remembering from that school. I'm currently a college student, currently in my 3rd semester. I am renting a small house by myself here. The college is 10km away from my home but i often need to go there by foot because transportation is not that good here. Oh, I'm from Mizoram, a small underdeveloped state in India.I'm not particularly good at studying. I already have 3 back paper during my 1st and 2nd semester. I also am quite ugly, and have acne. i have never had a girlfriend. The fact that i am poor, and bad at socialising could also play a big factor on that. Also i genuinely am not interested in relationships.As i said. I am a pathetic person. I envy others. Most of my classmates have a motorcycle so i want one a lot too. But it's hard earning money here, as there are no part time jobs, and my family is poor so i know i will never have one. As such i don't really enjoy my college life. Provided my grade is already really bad, and looking at the bleak future, i don't even think continuing studying is worth it.I am an atheist. So i don't really believe in the afterlife. I have never valued life. I don't really care if i die, because that would just mean that i would be leaving this world a little earlier. I don't really care when people die either. These things just comes as a natural thing to me. Many people die everyday, our time will come sooner or later.My parents are christians. They already know that i turned atheist. I also know how disappointed they are on me. Our home always remained my safe haven before. But now all i get after going home is endless sermon at my face, and i still can't miss a single church day because my parents want me to attend it. And indeed i want to fulfill this little wish of theirs. But unknowingly this also became one of the reason why i don't enjoy home anymore. One of the reason could be that we always have a prayer before eating food, but they never fail to pray for me to convert back to christian. It is always extremely uncomfortable. And then i started thinking recently. I don't value my life, I don't care if i die at all. I only value my life for my parents, to live for them. I deeply love them, and i want to do something for them in this life. We are poor so i atleast want to bring some richness into my family. But now they are extremely disappointed in me, disappointed that i became an atheist, disappointed that i am so bad at my studies. And i also am disappointed in myself for letting my parents down in many ways. I just want to leave this life.I tried adding colour to my life a lot. I started playing games. Recently i played league legends and valorant. I indeed enjoy them. But it's extremely limited when you don't have anyone to play with, i have some friends mind you, but they don't really play games. It gets boring very easily. I also started watching lots of porns. I masturbate a lot. But these things don't really seem to help me much. Instead i became much more depressed realising that i am trying so hard to achieve nothing. I just want to end this pathetic life of mine thinking these things.A few days back, i ate some rat poison due to sudden impulsiveness. I immediately regret after eating it. But i ended up not caring and i went to sleep after making a short call to my parents, ofcourse i said nothing about the rat poison thing. Surprising nothing happened, my stomach didn't even hurt a bit after that. Maybe i was actually afraid of death, so i became quite spirited after realising nothing happened. And i doubt i would do something that stupid again lol. I got quite a scare there. Due to covid 19, my life is extremely boring these days. I didn't went home so i live alone in my rented house having nothing to do. To be honest i am very disappointed that my parents didn't ask me to go home. But for reasons i don't feel like going home either. Now that i typed these things out, it seems to be the accumulation of lots of things that made me lose interest in this world. I'm quite pathetic don't you think? Just because i came from a poor family, i don't have many friends, i'm ugly, i don't own a motorcycle like others, and my relationship with my parents became a bit sore, i want to stop living!! I know there are lots and lots of people out there with way worse condition than me that still tries their hardest to live! Though my logical thinking questions the purpose of such life of suffering, i suddenly feel like my life is not that bad anymore.This post actually helped me a lot. I feel like i release a lot of frustration through this post. It made me realize how pathetic i actually am! And maybe i should try a bit harder in looking for values in life. IF anyone is till reading to this point, thanks a lot for reading.","77":"Disclaimers:Using a throwaway account as it contains a lot of personal informationEnglish isnt my first language so please pardon my errorsWriting this on a mobile at 3:44AM so I'm not sure of the formatting and coherency Please help me! \ud83d\ude2dBackstory:I(23M) have been in an out of 3 relationships, currently in my fourth relationship. It's been 2 years since I've known her, closely, 6 years since she was my acquaintance and been in this relationship for the last 9 months. We were best friends while i was in my 3rd relationship, she had a huge liking towards a singer who was locally famous(all three of us are from the same college), while i was her friend, she proposed and he rejected. After that I happened. She has this habit of playing with my hair when im driving (she used to do with the singer guy too), but i was conscious since I was losing my hair and was having a hairstyle so as to fill my spots. I was a bit jealous as the other guy had thick hair and wanted my balding to not cause a problem , so i started to get hair loss treatment which consisted of Rogaine and Finasteride.At the same time, I started to feel jealous about the equation which my gf had with this singer and conveyed the same. They were supposedly best friends, but their vibes threw me off. She told that she felt restricted and needed a break. After the break she came back and told me that she no longer had any feelings for him so I need not feel insecure. However, cut to a month later, I find texts stating how she misses him and How she feels that if they would've been together it would have been great. She also had a habit of saying \"I love you\" to that singer guy, which i wasn't cool , so she told thay she'd stop saying. But that day she even told him that she loves him. I confronted her, she told that it was very vague and she did not mean it at all and she loved him as a friend(whatever that means). We were already having many fights due to incompatibilities, but this broke me completely. From that day onwards, I have lost my ability to think straight, stalked her on instagram, would check if she liked or commented on the songs he posted, etc. In totality i became toxic which was'nt my trait. I was pretty outgoing and the irony was that i left my ex because i was feeling restricted. I asked her to stop talking to him as i was losing my individuality and was focusing on what she was doing, She tried to stop, but would talk to him in someway or the other. It got to a point where i would even hate her mentioning his name while texting. The last time she stopped talking to him, they talked for 4 hrs continuous when they started. I lost my shit and asked her to give me break. I had a panic attack and was about to jump off my balcony. I have totally lost my self confidence, sleep and peace of mind. Im always sad and anxious. I feel that I'm not sufficient and I cannot give her what that other guy can(he's popular and sings well). She gave me an ultimatum to either get over my insecurities or be done with the relationship.In this process of being with her, I lost all of my friends. I have no one to talk to except for reddit. Even now, I'm not able to express myself completely as I feel that it would put her in bad light. I read some articles on how Finasteride induces anxiety, depression, insomnia and a craving for sweets. All of which match with my symptoms. If I continue this way I'll be depressed and if i lose my hair I'll never be confident again. I dont know what to do, i just feel like ending my life now. I feel like there's no one who understands me. I am from India, people here would laugh at me if i tell them that I'm depressed. I know its a long post, thank you for reading through and reaching to this point. Please help me\u2639\ufe0f","78":"This may sound fake. It definitely may sound fakeBut I just can\u2019t take it anymoreLife is nightmarish. I can\u2019t even talk about it because it\u2019ll cost me my life. The best I can do is to say that everyone should check the condition of India now. Being a Muslim, it\u2019s just nightmarish to live in India now. I may have to delete my post too because it\u2019s just too dangerous to keep. I think of suicide every day but I can\u2019t because I know that suicide will mean that I\u2019ve lost and can\u2019t complete the myriad dreams I have As if that wasn\u2019t enough, I have shitloads of exams coming up and goodness, they are the hardest I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. And after those exams, I have yet another set of exams which I really can\u2019t explain due to certain problems. I know this very much sounds fake but it\u2019s true. Living in a police state alongside having educational and parental pressure does that to your mindSorry if I ranted too much. I have chronic anxiety problems too. Just leaving this here so that at least I can share, which takes some of the pain away","79":"**Let me make this clear i am not trying to flex about anything.** (The cousins in this are my second cousins but we are quite close so I just consider them my cousins)So a bit of context i have indian parents but we do not live in India even tho i was born there I have an australian upbringing because i have lived here for 12 years out 18 year old life so far. So I have nowhere near the study ethic a proper indian student should have but i still get top 5 in my class for most of my classes and sometimes top 5 in my year leveel for others. But my parents or my family in India aren't happy with that. Because one of my cousins got top 4% in the country in her final year of school and another cousin got top 2% and another one got top in the state so the standards for me now set by my parents and everyone that  I know.  But the thing is I am nowhere near that and if i tried to be I'd rather kill myself than get that because I like to have something called a life other than studying. And its like I need top 20% to get into the uni and course I need so thats what I am studying for but if I get more I'll be ecstatic but if I get less than that I'll still be happy because I know I tried my hardest.   So the main thing in life for me is to be around people i love and they lock me back and I get motivation to do something when I'm around people that have back for me so when I don't see people I'm down in the dumps. So the expectations that are set, are literally pushing away at my mental health now and my relationships with people. Like I'm starting to lose friends which I never want to. My relationship with my parents is going down faster than the speed of light because they expect me to be in my room just studying for 3-4 hours on a school day and 6-7 hours on a non-school day which is just way too much for me to think about. This expectation set by my family is costing me my relationships i have with others including themselves.  Like an hour or so ago i had gotten back from work and started video calling my uncle to see what was up because he had called a couple of times but I couldn't pick up. My dad was like stop talking to people and get to studying and it's like I need some time. So 10 mins later he comes back and says why tf aren't you studying and just gives me a lecture again which gets me down in the dumps pretty quickly and i see a scissor and just think about cutting because I've literally got no one to talk to, my parents haven't even come in to see what I'm doing in the past 2 hours or even check up.   There have been cases where my dad has literally told me and i quote \"I don't respect you as my son\" when I wanted to know the reasoning behind me not being able to go without my friends in summer holidays (they are in december for me) or me getting 95% or 52\/55 on a math exam and 3rd in the whole school for a math exam and him being like why didn't you get 1st or why didn't you get 100% and it's like thanks appreciating my 25+ hours of study i put in that week and 60+ hours in the 2 weeks leading up to it. (This was school assessed so it didn't matter much as my end of year exams).  My friends aren't of much help because well just say this I thought they were laughing with me but they were laughing at me so I don't really go to them and also I'll be a burden to most of them so there's that.  I've tried talking to my mum about it and shes like its your dad's fault and if I say something I'll get in trouble and she backed my dad with the i dont respect you debacle.  So any tips?

But i also hate me so it's okay.* After my friendship ended with her, i befriended this other girl and guy, and they were really sweet to me, We'd sit together, have lunch etc.# Heartbreak* This new girl ( lets call her Sid) btw we were just really good friends.* She was suffering with depression just like me, and we instantly connected with each other, and she'd share her pain with me, everyday i'd ask her how she is.Shit i'm sorry this hard to talk about.I'll give a timeline that i can sort of remember.October 19th 2017 It was a festival we celebrate in Indian culture called diwali. This was the day she told me she tried to kill herself, because of all the pain she felt, she opened up to me, and we spoke for hours, she cried a lot, but i finally felt like someone trusted me enough to share their deepest pain with.October 20th She called me asking her to take her back home to India, i jokingly told her, we have to get through med school together, then i'd take her back home. October 21st - Till this day, has been the hardest day of my life.* She messaged me early morning, she posted a black picture on instagram, and gave me her instagram details and asked me \"make sure nobody posts anything bad in the comments\" i was like okay i guess.* Later that day she'd message me telling me, that she was feeling cold, and i tried calling her, but she wasn't picking up.Sorry it's a bit hard to talk about.* My cousin called me 1 hour later, asking me if i knew about the girl who passed away from my class. I was in complete shock.* I tried calling her, no answer, but then i called her roommates and they told me she's fine. i felt relief but at the same time i needed answers to who had passed away.* My cousin called again 5 minutes later, telling me Sid from my class had passed away. Her roommates fucking lied to me.I completely broke inside, cried so hard, i didn't know what to do, i was contemplating jumping of the building, I kept asking my self if i could of done something, I still blame myself everyday, that i could of done more, if i could of seen the signs earlier, i could of done more. She still shows up in my dreams.# Relationships Part 2* After a month of her passing, this group of people 2 guys and 2 girls, asked me to come hang out with them, we became decently good friends after this,* I did gain bad habits from them, i started drinking because of them. Even got tattoos, and lost my first kiss to one of them.* Long story short, I'm entirely to blame for our friendship falling apart. My depression and trust issues got in the way, and they weren't about that lifestyle.* I was more of baggage than a friend. Again i'm to blame for this,&amp;#x200B;# University Part 2* I ended up dropping out of university in 2018, and i went back to Canada, and I've pretty much been here since then, gained a lot of weight, and have almost lost my mind completely.# Family* Our family has grown apart, i have no connections to my cousins, and most of my family has passed away.* I'm no longer close with my older brother, we have had our fair share of fights, and 90% of the time it was my fault, and i take blame for it. We don't talk as much, but i don't say anything to him anymore to upset him.* My parents say i'm fine and nothing is wrong with me, and that i no longer need antidepressants, and they keep bringing it up that i should go back to medical school, even though i don't want to.&amp;#x200B;# Pain Part 1* My brother has a girlfriend, who was really nice to me, kind of wish she was my sister, but it is what it is. She'd stay over sometimes for weeks, while they were studying. * I remember opening up to her about everything, and right away, and for the first time i actually felt better, whenever i'd relapse and have a panic attack, she was there to help with the pain. She'd say the right things at the right moment.* I hate myself for causing her so much of problems, i did overstep boundaries, asking if i could call her when she's free to talk about what i'm going through.* My brother didn't like it, and it would cause a lot of problems and rift between everyone, to the point where she didn't want to stay over anymore, because she felt like she was the problem.* This was all my fault, and i should of never opened up to her, or overstep boundaries.But my brother did turn around at some point, and did allow her to help me, but i took advantage of her kindness, and asked for to much help, probably overwhelming her with all my problems.In my eyes she changed quite a lot after she graduated, maybe it was to protect herself from her own demons. And when ever i'd tell her that she changed, she would get upset, sometimes block me, and then telling me it hurts when i tried so hard and to hear how \"i changed, and i'm a bad person for leaving\"&amp;#x200B;I't took me a while to realize that i was causing the same person who was trying their best to save me from my own demons, so much of pain.&amp;#x200B;I'f i could go back in time, i'd rather suffer the pain and not tell her.We had a really bad fall out, and both her and my brother stopped talking to me.I still remember the words she told that still to this day makes me cry.\" I tried to help you but you don't listen anymore, and you keep doing the same thing, and i need to step back and i can't help you anymore\" when i heard those words, i lost all hope.This was when my brother and her went for graduation.I'm a shitty person, because i ruined her graduation weekend, by getting upset at her for ignoring me all of a sudden.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward, we go back home after graduation, both her and my brother left our house, and he went to stay with her and her family. Nobody spoke to me for almost a month. I felt like such a monster.&amp;#x200B;# My lowest point.I ended up emailing her, telling her a lot of bad things, how she quit on me, and that i feel like an evil person etc, and i told her i'm going to kill myself because i am in too much of pain.i really am a shitty person, i ended up taking a bunch of pills, and ended up in the hospital for 4 days. Since then we haven't talked as much, or whenever i mention my problems, she'd tell me to talk to my parents.&amp;#x200B;I don't blame her for diverting all the time, she has her own demons herself. I still don't know why she still talks to me. I know it's not the same person who use to go out of their way to help me. &amp;#x200B;We still talk these days, but it doesn't feel the same anymore, and i think today is the day i stop talking to her, and let her and my brother live their life.  &amp;#x200B;I don't want to cause anyone any pain anymore.&amp;#x200B;Nobody really tried like she did. I'll always appreciate it.&amp;#x200B;I'm sorry if my story is all over the place, i have no one to talk to, and i've been thinking of leaving this earth this past few weeks. It's been getting worse each and each day. My depression has completely taking over me. I struggle to take a shower, sometimes i don't shower for days.&amp;#x200B;I don't know what to do anymore?? i'm seriously thinking about ended it all, it feels like i can't breath anymore. I have no money, no job, no friends, (feels like i have no family) all i have is my demons. And i want them gone.&amp;#x200B;# More info if anyone is interested ( Psychologist, Medication)* I've been on may different antidepressants, but they didn't seem to work.* Also been to many different psychologist, many sessions, but i didn't feel any different about myself.* I've even been to group therapy for 2 weeks, after trying to take my life, but even that didn't help.","87":"My medicine doesn\u2019t work, my doc is a POS who basically only laughs at my problems and even I had to recommend him to prescribe something more modern than the medicine he originally prescribed to me. And now he is arrogant and everything because me and my brother out of medicine and we called him and he was angry how we should make an appointment 3 weeks before. Yet he knows how the withdrawal could affect you.I can\u2019t feel joy or happiness, nothing, I ordered clothes to make me happy. They didn\u2019t. I ordered makeups to make me happy nothing. I am just a bystander.I got a 5 during my pathophysiology exam and only those who got a 5 will be invited to a fancy dinner party organised by the Department. Yet I am not happy or fulfilled. I didn\u2019t take one of my exams ( a little one you don\u2019t have to repeat the semester for it you can just take the class over the next year) and I had huge anxiety attacks after that and guilt that they will drop me out of the university.In fact I always have this huge irrational fear that I forgot something and I will be dropped out of med school.I lost some years due to the fact that I was too afraid to take exams and I couldn\u2019t go. No confidence and it was a plus thing to come over and it totally took a toll on my mental health.Narcissistic parents especially my mother who is in hospital now and she constantly blackmails me psychologycally, talks bad things behind my back even to strangers, creates guilt in me, no support, nothing. She does the same to my brother who has the same problems as me.Ofc no relationship at the age of 25, never had anything serious or loving, only people who were kinda attracted to me. I think they sensed my lack of self confidence and weaknesses and they took advantage of it. Honestly I gave up the thought of a healthy loving relationship, I guess it will never find me, because how messed up I am or I am unlovable. Everybody is like wait for it and I am sure you will find somebody who deserves you but not really. I just cut ties with toxic guys. So nothing.Currently I am back in my hometown from university for a while and I have no friends here anymore. They moved out of town or we lost contact etc.I feel like I am uninteresting, unlovable mess, who constantly messes up everything and never will be happy.I am 25 and I have mental health issues since the age of 11-12 I guess but all my memories from my childhood are connected with anxiety.It just feels like that if I feel this shit at 25 and I felt shit during my whole life then how am I going to feel at 50 or 40? If I ever make it there.I am the bystander of my own life and it just passes and I can\u2019t live only survive and it sucks. I don\u2019t really find the meaning of life, I don\u2019t have real friends, I realised many of them were or are toxic ones. I don\u2019t feel anything positive, just I really feel like I have to survive. And life is just negative things nothing good ever happens. Only financial problems, health issues, backstabbing, losing a loved one, break ups, cheatings etc...And I also realised that you are only worth anything in this life if you have money, you aren\u2019t really worthy oh no, it\u2019s just your money. Every company is so nice and put this mask on how they support a noble cause ( like Coca Cola during pride month) but in reality it\u2019s just all for money and they don\u2019t really care. Or companies like H&amp;M ( how they are gonna make environment friendly clothes yet they have workers in India and Bangladesh who suffer to make end meets for a really bad salary working for 12-14 hours)It\u2019s just hypocrisy. And these things just remind me that human life and fates are nothing to the world, only money is your worth. Of course the latter ones didn\u2019t cause my health issues it\u2019s just a plus and to basically realise how bad the world it is. Even if somebody does something to be just kind they must make a video of it for views. I am talking in general, sorry if I offend somebody.I just feel so lonely and meaningless( English is not my native language and I am kinda in an exhausted mood mentally so sorry for the mistakes and I am on my phone so editing is probably bad)","88":"I\u2019m a recent graduate and I have been having issues securing employment. Today I had to take a drug screen they do the urinalysis and for me they are extremely hard. I have to use a hat, I\u2019m female, because of my stupid body. Then, I take what I call an anti pee pill. I have to take it otherwise the smallest amount of liquid going in causes me to basically piss my pants even if I\u2019m just 5 feet away from the bathroom. As soon as the urge hits, it\u2019s too late. Have had this problem since I was 7, am now 36 so I\u2019ve taken a pill the last 10 years. I take 2 in the morning and 2 before bed. It typically causes a little issue doing a pee test but I can handle it. Today was not the day. I drank a lot on my way to the testing site, i then was like here we go. She didn\u2019t want me to use the hat and I\u2019m like legit I have to use it. Then you have 4 minutes to take the test. I\u2019m like ok give me a time limit. Deer in headlights for the whole 4 minutes. Wasted that hat and cup. Get a 8oz bottle of water. I drink it and ask for another can\u2019t have another until I pee or until 30 minutes later. So I feel the urge to go like I feel I\u2019m going to potty in my pants I\u2019m like yes let\u2019s do this. Literally barely enough pee to fill a soda bottle cap. Like wtf is that. Tried again same shit and now they are out of hats so it\u2019s a refusal to take the test. Lost that job due to refusing the drug screen. Then hear from a job that I did a 4 fucking interviews for that they moved on with someone else. Then, looked at my states job site of all the jobs for state gov jobs applied too have all been listed at \u201cnot selected\u201d got email for one of them. So three in a matter of 2 hours plus the other 4 that were \u201cnot selected\u201d but no notification yet. Like seriously this is weighing down on me. I want to work, I\u2019m ready to work, I know this is a rough time as we are dealing with COVID but also that IT positions in my area had hundreds of applicants both locals and the out of staters that move here every day making it harder. Move here I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just more experienced people in IT that will get jobs over me. I\u2019m all about entry level right now. And like they train you, you don\u2019t need technical skills to even get the job and I have tech skills but still not getting the jobs. I feel like a fucking loser! My husband just says don\u2019t give up. And it\u2019s like how can I not. In 3 months I\u2019ve been turned down for approximately 45 jobs if not more. Told my husband I\u2019m going to take a couple months off, still gonna look but not make it my job everyday and instead I\u2019m going to do some self studying and try to pass CompTIA Network+ certification and CompTIA A+ and try again. I\u2019m just  cc so frustrated and tired of being turned down for jobs I can do and do very well. I know a lot of people going thru this, but I feel like I was lied too. Everyone told me hey get you a stem degree you\u2019ll have jobs finding you. Recruiters from India, China, South Korea are all over me but they are just scams. But jobs in my area? Crickets. Beating down my mental health every day.","89":"1. I got diagnosed with clinical depression a couple of days back and have been asked to take medicines for the same 2.

Thanks :)","90":"Hi everyone, I'm desperately looking for amineptine, the only antidepressant that has ever worked.  depression and cognitive - memory reduction in most cases is dependent on low dopamine levels.  despite this , the only dopaminergic on sale is bupropion,which didn't work for everyone or didn't work at all , or stop working after few weeks. there is still insistence on treating depression with serototinergics, unnecessary drugs, which worsen and exacerbate the problems of chronic fatigue, hypersomnia, brain fog, cognitive impairment,  lack of motivation, memory loss, lack of interests, low libido , low energy, which can induce permanent sexual dysfunction. I read that amineptine it is currently sold in India and Egypt.  I ask Indian and Egyptian users to check the current availability of this drug in these countries. anyone who knows a pharmacy, a small pharmaceutical industry that synthesizes it on commission or sell it, please let me know. I'm from Europe,but I saw that is possible to buy as a \"research purpose only\" molecule from private pharmaceutical companies in USA. Anyone can help?  if we join forces we can find it or have it produced, alone i can do little, only by passing from words to deeds, we can hope to get something. There are a lot of website of \"India markets\" that sell it, but they're all scams, that ask 100 or more dollars for 20 pills but didn't ship anything after receiving money, speculating on world's famine of amineptine. we have to collaborate and join forces, because this drug could be a life-saver. unfortunately it was withdrawn from the market because it really worked, and people were returning to their lives, ending up wasting money on unnecessary psychotherapy or ssri (check forums where users shares their experience with amineptine,it was amazing, more stamina, improved cognitive and memory, even better orgasm). this was unacceptable to lobbies, because a depressed patient is a client who spends money for life for ineffective treatments, and could not accept that people healed.  the reality is that amineptine was taking away the market from the ssri therefore it was withdrawn for phantom security reasons. I was visited by the best psychiatrist and neurologist,  working in hospitals and teaching at universities. They all said that to me, I'm not invent from my mind,they also told me that was amazing with parkinson too,without the dangerous sides of pramipexole for example. it was developed in France by Servier (the same company that produce stablon - tianeptine) and had a market share higher than the ssri.  the abuse problem was due to the fact that it was erroneously used in cocaine disaffection therapy, so cocaine addicts took huge quantities (10-20 grams per day) to try to recreate the same effect as cocaine. The lobbies used this fact to justify the withdrawal of amineptine. Consider that. ..have you ever seen a medicine withdrawn all over the world in the same moment for some abuse by cocaine addicts? Never happened...there are tons of harmful medication with hundreds of papers and studies demonstrating it, but still selled worldwide, even if patients and doctors know about the toxicity... and in any case we speak of very few cases, which do not concern depressed patients.  psychiatrists told me that bupropion it is used as a therapy for disaffection by cocaine too, and is taken by cocaine addicts shredded and then inhaled, but wasn't withdrawn from the market....For more info read thiswww.amineptine.com(The source indicated in this site however is not reliable,don't buy on it , don't waste money, it's a scam, i already tried and tested the shit selled and wasn't pure, with a lot of impurities, not for human consumption)","91":"Hi I am a student from India, I am sad these days, I am bored I was studying from 4 months minimum 4 hours daily, I feel sad because my friend have cleared this exam when he was 22 but I am 23 and soon be 24 but my exams are in may 2021, I have dropped school for 1 year in past and had done mistakes because of which I lost 3 years... I regret because of this, even I know I can clear the exam and get good carrier, but I am sad \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d, why I am comparing myself with others ...","92":"I'm 21, living in India and honestly can't remember the last time i felt happiness which wasn't quite literally momentary and fleeting. i am tired of my folks, because they don't\/just cannot understand where I'm coming from when i sit em down and explain things to them. earlier i thought they were wilfully ignorant but I'm not so sure now...they've seen me through a lot of things. rage episodes, depressive episodes. but they just. don't.  get. it. everything is a personal attack to my parents no matter how kindly i try to convey that it isn't. i did poorly in HS because i was still depressed as fuck, but just didn't know it yet. so then i got into a bad college. which is gonna end up in me going to another bad school for post grad LOL. i know that i can't blame the entire thing on my parents but i feel like in my heart i just KNOW that if i had a little more support when it all started i could be better.now i just doubt if I'm the dick or they are...but i haven't felt hope or joy since 2011. im done and tired. and im so, so, so, easily overwhelmed by the work i will have to do even dig myself out of this hole..that the work to do after that to be successful doesn't even cross my mind. i have a mini mental breakdown at the thought. i don't know how depressed i am. or IF i even am depressed but everyday feels like hell. and i never have anything to wake up for...edit: I'm not trying to boast \ud83d\ude2d but i get a lot of \"you're gorgeous\" \"you're stunning\" etc and ive also been reached out by modelling and talent agencies and they all tell me i not only look stunning but also unique etc etc and so i feel worse about being so fucking sad","93":"Look I love tradition, Once a year we do something together as a family that's a good thing and it is healthy for any relationship. But the culture hurts people more than someone expects. I am a 19-year-old Indian in depression. I blame the culture and gender norms for my depression.The culture in India is so bad that parents **don't think** it's important for kids to have their privacy. I don't even have a lock for my room and my mom said she'd even tear down the walls for my room if necessary. Which I was and still am afraid that she'd do. I have been controlled by guilt, shame and with a word called \"respect\" all my life and compromise is not meeting in the middle but It's accepting all the demands and then choosing VERY FEW of the options now left for me which I am not interested in.I have so many things I'd like to say to all parents but they are not willing to listen. This is the same way many of our parents have been raised. Putting aside if it is the correct way or not, We are NOT stuck in the 1990s, we are in 2020, Please, I am NOT asking YOU to change, parents. I'm just asking you to let your children decide how they live in at least in a few parts of their life. Advice is always appreciated, so is your concern but that doesn't justify you threatening to do something that we find sadness in.My mom says \"You need to look after us when we get old.\" Which I got to admit is pretty common in Indian culture so she doesn't seem to think anything is wrong with it but I got a life that I didn't ask. I lived a life that was not mine. Everything that has happened is something that I didn't wish for. All I wished was that we stay happy as a family without any fights.I don't know when did our society forgot that children are their own person. Not a tool to compare marks with other parents. Not a pet to give commands. Parents and Adults expect us to act like adults while you treat us like children. You expect us to stay out of \"grown-up conversation\" when we try to be grown-ups, You make decisions without our consent then be angry if we do anything without your consent. I DO NOT think this is fair. How do you think this is fair? I like this quote \"I don't know how to act my age this is the first time I'm in it\". You can say just do as I say I have been your age, but you are\/were not 19 years old in the year 2020.Times have changed, ways have changed, so many things have been invented to make our lives better but our mindset did not change. Please I have to ask you to not forget my experience and views. I have been hurt a lot and my priorities right now go like; Me, Internet\/games, Parents. Yes. I like my internet and games more than my parents because I think if not for games and online friends, I'd have suicided in 9th grade itself, BECAUSE of my parents. I could say I hate them but they didn't know it was hurting me this bad, I didn't talk to them too. I don't think I can ever hate them but that also doesn't mean I can forgive them for what they did. What can I say more than that, it's complicated.","94":"I have been seeing a psychiatrist and going to therapy.

But I am feeling defeated not because I can't do things but because bad luck is not leaving me ,it has happened many times where the ball or opportunity slips from my hand.Long story short: I am a deck officer in merchant Navy, joined this field due to financial hardships at home. Now, since 2015 my career growth has been tremendous slow to the point that I have cut down all communicatins with my pals as all of them are doing well .I signed off from my ship in July-19 , I had gave readiness to my present company in Sep-19 but then they said me that I need to do some inhouse courses to join and this time they will give me promotion for 2nd officer which was long overdue.Only thing was that course was scheduled in Jan-20, due to promotion thing I agreed ,and then after Jan-20 when I asked when I will be joining back to ship ,they said that it would be in Feb,but it would be at same rank and not promotional rank. Promotion will be subject to onboard appraisal and even then there is no guarantee this was said by a superintendent who is a captain btw, one of the most negative persons you will ever met.Since Sep-19 I was trying for other companies , and luckily (or unluckily) My promotional thing was accepted by one of the largest ship management companies after clearing their interviews and all.Then in Feb-19 , I did their in house courses ,gave my documents etc. ,they have already lined up for a ship where joining would be in April. And thanks to Covid-19 , everything got fucked up. But then in end-may, Government of India  started giving permissions for charted flights specially for seafarers. Most of my friends have gone back to their jobs., while I am still stuck and the new company is not even giving me any hope.Since I had already given my documents and all to this new company, my present company won't entertain me as I haven't been keeping touch with them .Now , I am in a very critical situation .I am not able to pay the debts of a consumer loan which I had taken in nov-19 which is affecting my credit score and also huge interest of 36 percentage and also the bounce charges which is being levied by the bank . All mutual funds are in negative and I have stopped all the SIPs, Home loan is being taken care of due to moratrium but when the honeymoon period ends, I would be in deep shit. Many here might say ,that I should not have buy a house or taken a loan, let me tell you that that whole life I have lived in a 150 sq.ft room, and I atleast deserved to live a better life after slogging so much and then also I played quite safe and my EMI is still 20 percentage of my yearly earnings.Every week , I am calling my new company and their response is abysmal ,now they say that the vessel which I had been lined up for has no sign off plans even for thr next monthIt's not that this has happened for the first time, since I joined this field in 2009, I have been facing a very tough time both proffesionally and personally. I have not given up on myself ,but then it is getting very difficult to stay positive and think good when life gives you blow after blows.","96":"I have been fighting the demons inside my mind for 5 years. And after tonight, I think I am finally ready to stop fighting, and let whatever is going to happen, happen. 5 years ago, when I was 15, I lost my best friend to Leukaemia. I was still in school, and it caused me to spiral. I took days off, but I was able to stabilise myself, and finish school a year later. After I graduated, I missed out on University, because it cost too much. I quickly realised that University wasn't for me anyway, and I decided on my new career path. I started talking to this girl online in March of 2017. She was 4 years older than me, but she was the first girl that really showed any interest in me, so I jumped at the chance, despite not actually feeling ready. Problem was she lived in Croatia, and I live in Australia. We agreed to go long distance for a few months, meet in November, and work things out from there. I should have realised something was wrong from the fact that she never wanted to call. She never wanted to talk long term plans. I started talking to another girl in India, because of this. I was told by Croatian girl in June of 2017, that she had been seeing someone else the whole time, and the only reason she was talking to me is because I made her feel special. During our \"relationship\" my mum had a severe stroke to which she will never recover. She lives in a Nursing Home a fair drive away from where I live now. Just after Croatian girl and I ended, I entered a long distance relationship with the Indian girl, and for the first few months it was heaven, until the cracks started to show. She was very emotionally immature, which caused her to lash out in fits of anger, we tried for 2 years, (young, naive kids with no money) fighting nearly daily, before she just abruptly left. I had to come to grips with the fact she was gone, but my friends helped me get through it. Almost a year to the day after it ended, the girl reached out. She was apologetic, told me she was incredibly sorry for the pain she caused me, and that she had moved on and was happy. She also wanted to be friends. That hurt, but it was what it was, I had no interest in being her friend, because the feelings were still unresolved. Skip forward to my current issue. She reached out a few days ago telling me she needed my help. I, like the idiot I am, responded. She told me she wanted to do some stuff on YouTube and that was it. She called, we discussed it, and I told her that I have no interest in communicating any further. She told me she planned on moving here. For the last few days, I had been receiving mixed messages from her, one minute she loved me, and she wanted to try again, the next she was saying it would never happen. I allowed myself to get suckered in, allowed myself to believe that there was a chance I could get back with the woman I had always thought was my soulmate. We just had a big fight after I told her that I couldn't be her friend. Now here I am, broken AGAIN, and I just don't want to fight this anymore.","97":"I am in the US, originally from India. I am living here for more than a decade with a standard long hour work style to escape the isolation. I got married here. Due to the religious situations, our family, they are not interested in my intercaste marriage so no one from either family attended the wedding. Finally, they accepted and I am married for more than half-decade.  For work situations, my wife and I had to live apart and it's been close to a year. Meanwhile, my mom passed away abruptly from low blood pressure. I was not able to attend my mother's funeral and due to my current visa situation. I started doing some volunteer work. It helped me cope up with some of the depression. But one day I was hit by a car while walking. I broke my leg and was on bed rest for more than a month. It was a hit and run case. Meanwhile, lockdown made my depression unbearable. Most people around me just want to give professional courtesy support. I am isolated and could not function making me miserable. I could not continue to volunteer due to COVID-19. I lost interest in all my work activities. I feel like leaving the US and continue doing full-time social work. In doing so I will become a disgrace to my family. Even if I ignore everyone this social isolation is going to keep me in here locked up. I am a trapped frog in a well.","98":"Got laid off from my job of 5 years today. The owner said it's so I can realize my potential &amp; do more artistic things with my skillset, but I really loved my responsibilities getting people in to see their therapists when they needed to. I was the front office manager at a Psychological practice with a dozen providers, &amp; I scheduled appointments &amp; made sure everyone had all the copies\/paperwork they needed &amp; stocked our supply cabinets &amp; also as a side job cleaned the whole office building on the weekends. I'd never held a job for half a decade before. It was my favorite one I'd ever had &amp; by far the most rewarding. My life is about to be so different &amp; I'm trying not to be sad &amp; see it as an opportunity instead of grieving the loss of what I thought would be my career for quite a while. I know it's okay to feel the emotions right now &amp; then release them, I just hope I don't struggle too hard with the second half of that.I've struggled hard with depression on &amp; off since high school, particularly after an assault led to a dangerous &amp; damaging shift in my personality &amp; PTSD, but I thought I was holding it together fairly well this year considering all the misfortune &amp; misery apparent everywhere you look. I've cried for Australia &amp; India &amp; the rainforests &amp; Hong Kong &amp; Africa &amp; all those hit by the virus or the effects it has had on our society; now I'm crying for myself &amp; I feel so selfish. I was so happy this morning because it was my 10th Cake Day &amp; it felt kinda significant in a really informal &amp; random internetty way &amp; I was thinking about how some real, progressive changes might be enacted this year with society standing up for Justice, but now I'm just so very sad.Sorry this is kind of a ramblefest; I'm a bit out of sorts at the moment.","99":"Hi. I got diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and what the psychiatrist termed as obsessive morbid thoughts? three years ago. The psychiatrist put me on meds and I was on them for about a month before discontinuing them. The meds made me very hazy and I'd be tired, sleepy and stressed the entire day even after a good night's sleep. There is not much scope for therapy in my small town(I'm from India) and I'm not really sure about online therapy. I contacted my psychiatrist again but they just said to increase my dosage without really hearing what I had to say.I always have had extremely intrusive thoughts which occur almost randomly, without any trigger. They usually range from thoughts of self loathing and disgust towards myself to violent thoughts. I do not have violent tendencies but I get these thoughts sometimes where I just see red and imagine inflicting pain on somebody. It can be a friend, my pet cat, family members, some stranger I met at the grocery store. They're always unprovoked from what I've noted. I  should stress that in no way, shape or form do I want to harm any living being but these thoughts just freeze my brain and for those few minutes, I cannot think about anything else but that. And post these thoughts, my thoughts again go on a self loathing marathon, disgusted at how I could even think about them..it is a loop, one that I cannot seem to escape.I used to self harm right until a few years ago, but I don't anymore. This is something that I'm really proud of that I've managed to overcome the tendency to self harm without any sort of outside intervention.Do any of you go through these sort of intrusive thoughts? And if you do, how do you deal with it? I'd like some pointers from people who have\/are going through this and get some insight. Thanks.","100":"I'm 29, male. Living in India and I can't afford therapy.I've often been told that I have a victim-complex. It's true, and I'm not shirking responsibility anymore. But every time I heard this accusation from loved ones, it completely broke me. It's a hard thing to deal with.... I look back and see my own mistakes, my refusal to take responsibility and instead, just hide behind my difficult childhood.&amp;#x200B;I had suffered quite horribly as a child, repeatedly and consistently.But I do believe that once those terrible things ended, my own mistakes started, since I blamed everything I suffered on other people. I didn't - and still usually can't - care for myself properly, I didn't work hard on my education or my career. But all of that is my fault.&amp;#x200B;Now, when I try to put my life together, it's a horribly painful prospect. I can't write a few words (this post included) without breaking down crying.

How do you cope?","101":"In all honesty i just feel being in an endless cycle of sameshit every day. For more context i am 20(M) living in India. So i am on medication for depression and anxiety for pasty year. They keep me you know normal. But as more and more time passes and i just can't find a reason to live. I know i am young and will find my passion and all that but i just feel so how do i describe this umm lazy. I don't want to live for someone else's sake. All i do is watch anime,, play games, sleep, shit and repeat. People of reddit what are your reason to live.","102":"This is a long read so be prepared. Growing up in the world has been quite difficult for me but I suppose that's normal for everyone. Everyone struggles, fights, and try to do their best in life to keep living.........but for how long? Ever since I was a kid I have been outcasted by ever group and have been bullied and falsely accused of shit I have never done only to be punished for it with no evidence. I have been all alone growing up in this world and I am still alone today. My parents have been abusive verbally and physically since I was a kid and even now they still are. I will just give you a couple examples.I was falsely accused of hurting a kid when I was 13. There was only one witness his friend and my principle believed him and when my parents found out they never even questioned it and my father beat me with a belt and I was expelled for a week. There have been other instances of similar stuff happening later on.As a kid my parents would say that I am a stupid dog who can't get anything right when I couldn't understand something in school or homework and because I am slow and unable to do things quickly.My parents are also toxic to each other and I would have to try to sleep at night with them yelling at each other.Anything I enjoyed or was good at was considered pointless to my parents. Such as video games, reading books or comics, drawing, music and computers. My father would try to take these items away from me many periods in my life as a way to punish me for not doing well in school. It never worked.In my first year in high school freshman year I decided to change myself and do better in my studies. By the end of the year I was able to get a 3.4 gpa which was a big improvement from my middle school years because during those times I never even did my work or pay attention in class. I believe the only reason I even did well was because my cousin lived with me during that time and he would support me that year and be a good friend. Unfortunately he left next year as he realized how toxic my family was and couldn't deal with them anymore. In 10th grade I completely stopped trying. My homework was never done and any tests I did was always 10 percent or less. My teacher realizing something was wrong and told my parents. My parents then abused me even more by yelling and cussing at me. They would come in my room without even knocking. I would block the door sometimes with an object only for them to bang on the door for 10 minutes before giving up. My dad once kicked the door open and broke it so the door was always open and I could hear them downstairs saying how terrible and annoying I was. I failed 10th that year.My grandfather during this time had cancer so my dad forced everyone to leave everything In the US and go to India despite me not wanting to go. He convinced me that we would be back within a few months. This was a lie and he forced me to go to a boarding school there. If you're not familiar on what that is its when you live inside the school. They took me to the school to apparently go check it out and see if I liked it. Of course I didn't. My dad told me he was going to use the bathroom. He never came back apparently I was signed up for the school without my knowledge. You couldn't try to escape either as there were walls around the entire school and guards constantly patrolling during the day and night. The school had disgusting living conditions with bed bugs and rats living in the dorms. The food was all vegetarian which I didn't mind other then the fact it was disgusting with mosquito bugs in it. I had lost a lot of weight living there as I almost completely stopped eating only eating white bread with jam on it at time to time. During the summer the place was extremely hot. They wouldn't turn on the air conditioning even though they had it. They said it was because it was too expensive. Which was a complete lie as they were getting money from parents of kids each month. Way more then they should by the way. I have literally seen people pass out from heat stroke because of how hot it got. The worst part was the bullying. I was in fights almost everyday usually with me being by myself with 4 or 5 others ganging up on me. I used to get stuff stolen from my locker, they had broken the lock multiple times to get in to steal food I saved like chips and juice which was rare to find in our school as it was only given out in special occasions. At night they would kick open on my door on purpose or bang on it very loudly to wake me up. The teachers and staff never did anything as they felt that I was being too sensitive.Now comes the part of the story that gets worse. I have never shared this to anyone. I was sexually harassed a lot at that school. When I would use the bathroom they would kick the door open to peek. They would make sexual remarks and asking me to do sexual favors for them and in return they would leave me alone. They would literally show their private parts to me on purpose and when that didn't work well......they tried to force themselves on me and of course I resisted and fought back. This happened multiple times during that year. Things got so bad that they threatened to kill me. I would stay awake at night scared for me life that they would come to my room and actually do it. With no sleep at night I would sleep during the day during classes and would get yelled at by the teachers. I tried multiple attempts to kill myself in that school. There used to be a building that was usually empty during break. I would go there and lean on the edge of the roof of the building just looking down gathering the courage to actually do it. No one cared no one listened not even my parents. They would come visit me time to time or call me on one of the staff phones but every time I would tell them the terrible things that happened they just ignored it. I never really told them about the sexual abuse I faced I was to scared to tell them.......I didn't think they would believe me and to this day I still haven't. Later on during the end of the year I convinced one of my family members to let me come home and take the bus instead. This only pissed off the people who hated me even more. During break they would come to my classroom or outside and harass me constantly telling me that if I ever told anyone what happened that they would hurt me or kill me if I they had the chance. One time when I was in the bathroom I was put In a choke hold from behind, I honestly believe he was going to kill me as he was enraged and shouting random nonsense that I couldn't understand, something about God wanting this to happen. Luckily some other kid came in who saw the entire thing and he let go of me and ran off. I eventually passed my classes despite doing no work or doing any homework that was given as the studies their were completely different then what I learned. It was a couple grades above my level like advanced psychics, chemistry, and calculus. When the exams came I clearly flunked them but apparently my dad paid the school to have someone else take them for me. The day I was suppose to go take the exams I refused too. My dad called a friend and another family member to force me to go take me to school. I had locked the door to my room and of course they kicked it open. They grabbed me and said they would do whatever it takes for me to go. They would undress me and make me put on the school uniform if they had too......they did try to do that but I caved in and followed their orders as I didn't want anyone to get hurt especially me. When I did finish 10th there I was stuck in India for another 3 months. During that time I realized that my mom and my brother and gone back to the US a month after I was put into that school. They never even told me they left. Apparently my brother was put into school in India too but didn't like it and within the first week they took him out without question. During that time I had multiple panic attacks that would happen late at night no one really bothered to ask what the screaming was about and would tell me to go to sleep. One night I had a really bad one and it lasted for a while one of my Aunts started slapping me for being insane this didn't help and made it worse eventually they left me alone and I was able to calm down. After 3 months I was suppose to go home to the US by myself. I have flown and traveled alone a couple times before so I was familiar with what to do. Of course my dad made an excuse and said I wouldn't be able to do it and told me to go with my aunt to the Philippines. This was of course a lie as a way for me to live there instead. I went anyway and ended up living with my uncle for a short time.When I was there I remember an incident that happened. I was yelled at my uncle who I was living with for apparently refusing to accept money from a family member who was there as it is a cultural custom to give money to someone who is way younger then you. I refused it because I felt that I was not going to spend it on anything and even if I did I would get yelled at for spending it on something stupid. I ended up living with a different family member the next day. one month later I finally came home to the US.I barely passed high school after that and fast forward to today those days still haunt me today. I have tried getting help over the years from meeting doctors therapists psychiatrists and psychologists. Therapy never really helped and I decided to take medication which only made me worse and have more mental breakdowns. I ended up becoming completely numb only feeling my depression and anxiety and over the years I have grown angry towards myself and the people who have hurt me. I have tried to suppress it but bottling up your emotions doesn't really help. I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was given 5 medications that I would take every day. One for the mania, one for my depression and anxiety, one for sleep, another one for a side effect of constantly shaking and one for extreme nausea. I had gained a lot of weight because of this and I now weigh around 200 pounds to my previous 160. The medication has helped a lot but I eventually stopped taking it because of the many side effects. I went to India again recently and stayed there for 2 months which was a bad idea and the only reason I did was because of family issues that were needed to be dealt with. This caused old painful memories to come back. I finally asked my dad why he even put in that school when I was there. He said it was because he wanted to make me stronger and learn to grow up and teach me a lesson.I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I live in confusion everyday. Nothing feels right and the things I used to enjoy just don't anymore. Even video games which I thought I would never lose interest in just aren't fun anymore. Nothing feels real anymore not even myself. My dreams feel more real to me then life itself. I know the stuff that happened to me isn't my fault but what am I suppose to do. Ya I can go work out or find a job or do a hobby or go to collage but whats the point if there is no emotion behind it? If there is no feeling behind it? If I just had one person In my life who believed me who would listen to me who cared for me who actually loved me that would be enough. But there is no one not even family. At this point I am convinced there is really no hope for some people. Its funny how people say how they got out of depression or mental illness and that you can do it to. Are you really sure about that....you never hear about the people who gave up on life because most people never got to hear their stories its only those who survive that really get to tell theirs. Not everyone gets an opportunity and even if you do there is no grantee you will succeed. How long do I have to keep walking I am tired so tired. Maybe I am wrong about the way I am looking at this but this is all i know. Thank you for staying this long to listen to my story and the fact you came this far means a lot to me. I was able to get a lot off my chest and I really do appreciate you for helping me do that. I really hope for the best for all of you. There is an answer to all our problems its just difficult to find is all.","103":"I'm 20yo from India doing Engineering course in Instrumentation. Some info: From small age, I was interested in software tech than anything but my parents were ignorant and joined me in pre med but I failed and they joined me in a very strict Engineering college only in the thought of doing good to me. I was depressed for  3 years and now regained some strength to learn on my own to become a software developer and to get a job in a top tech company. So I started with my journey and I have almost done few courses, I was already quite comfortable with C, and also some leetcoding. but I can't go further I have this feeling that I am not going to succeed, seeing a lot of my classmates already equipped well in these technologies,I am insecured if I can't compete with them.

Every question at work that puts me on a spot triggers a strong reaction and right now I am spiralling because of one such triggers. Job is very demanding but I just had to take a few days off because I just cannot focus . Work is scaring the hell out of me.

It's hard to just lie around all day because you don't have the will and somehow explain it to your family who are worried but unaware of what it feels like ( I come from India, depression isn't really a thing there).

We had to leave our house because it belonged to the company my dad was working for. I felt sad and on the last day, leaving it all, I cried. Now fast forward to a few months later. It was inevitable that we had to come to India. I joined a new school and oh boy was it fun. Everyone was absolutely unfriendly to the \"new kid\". Also I all the new kids in my neighbourhood were friendly but not too much. School was a disaster. My dad was in depression. He talked about collective suicide in front of me. My mom once locked herself in a room with knife. Thus had a profound effect on me. Then everything slowly started to settle. Or so I thought. My dad picked himself up. I found new friends in school and the neighbourhood kids also started warming to me. Then the mid term exams came along. Me and my friends got average marks. This was devastating. My one friend blamed me for his marks and he stopped talking with me. That was rock bottom 1. You see I depended emotionally on my friends. I really don't know why. Also the neighbourhood kids now started treating me like shit. Everything was worse. Then some dude in school who I knew and was friendly with invited me to join his group of friends. And I thought it was a new start. It was all over. Again I was wrong. Slowly I established a good rapport with all of them. And at the end of 8th grade, I left school happily. Then 9th started and all of my friends at school now started to distance themselves. For some unknown reason. But slowly we again started showing the same signs of friendship. So it was all okay. I guess. But I didn't know that I was headed to something much worse. I became the butt of all jokes. At first it wasn't even that bad. But then they started getting much more personal. They weren't even jokes at that point. They were straight up insults. That was depressing. Also I had just recovered from low self esteem. I think I had it at least. So again this was a blow to my self confidence. My friends were completely insensitive to my condition. They knew by the way. I even showed self destructive tendencies. Yet they never even tried. Like I told I was emotionally dependent on my friends. You see 9th is an important year. So parental pressure was at an all time high. They would start pointing all the small mistakes, even if they weren't mistakes. The neighbourhood kids  started treating me like shit again because I couldn't play cricket well. That was the sport that all those guys played. So home wasn't a happy place . School wasn't a happy place. And anywhere else wasn't a happy place. Slowly I started descending into insanity or at least it felt like it. I was briefly suicidal in my 8th. But in my 9th it was much longer. I had a stupid ideology that I was talentless and useless. And if I am that, then I should just kill myself, right? So I tried that. Nobody ever told me that choking yourself doesn't kill you. So that is what I did. 3 different times. This was rock bottom 2. But things went on with their ups and downs. One day my friends at school took it too far. I was sad about it. My mom after some digging found out about the teasing. That is only because it would affect my studies and completely  ignored the mental effects. She told my dad. And then he called my friend and asked him never to talk to me again. This was devastating as I was emotionally dependent on my friends. And also everyone was like this guy's cronies. So if he stopped talking, everyone would. And that thought terrified me. My dad even swore at me for being such a wuss. But this was a blessing in disguise. As I regained my self esteem. And I found out about my dependency on my friends. So I was able to control it. After a few fights and setting boundaries with the neighbourhood kids, they finally started respected me. They understood I wouldn't take any shit. Now I'm in 10th. Most important year of school life. No parental pressure is almost unbearable. I still cry sometimes. I get average marks in my tests. I used to get good before. Whenever I get bad marks , I cry a lot. I even sometimes feel like killing myself. And also know these are small tests. What is wrong with me? Please someone tell me. My parents tell me counseling is useless. They think whatever they say is EXACTLY what the counsellet would say. I know they want the best for me. But their approach is dead wrong. For me, at least. They don't realize the impact their actions have on me. Am I the wrong one ? What should I change in myself ? Am I  just being melodramatic ? Am I being stupid ? Do I just want sympathy ? Please tell me. You can tell me anything that will help. Even if I am a whiny bitch, you can tell me. Thank you to anyone who considers to read this and help me.","107":"My brother is acting up weird these days. He talks to everyone in the family like he's boss and others are his slaves.

I was confused at that time so i talked with many and got to know that after giving mba exams in November and December i can join in some companies in January and if I get a good college i can go there or else work in my company so i liked the idea and go for the mba.Fast forward to that i gave many exams got some decent scores not upto my expectations but i didn't wanted to waste a year so thought should go for the options i have but even before i could do some things i had an accident and got my back and leg injured and couldn't attend the MBA interviews neither could work for any company and my whole year got wasted.And after some time i recovered partially and was told that lower back injuries take time but i can do normal works just should not lift heavy or do any such. Exercises so i was already much depressed and out of sync with any thing so i contacted my friends and everybody said that since a year has gone without experience no company would take me and it was another shock for me.I talked to almost everybody i could and nothing was in my favour.Then a friend suggested me that i already had interned in big data during college time so i should learn machine learning and data science and i could get a decent package job. So i started learning those things but i was utterly depressed and could not get my mind to learn much in simple words my productivity was very low and before i could apply to some companies this corona happened and now most companies have their hiring freezed and i am fucking lost and feel ashamed of myself that during such crisis i cant help my family financially and even though being the such a smartass i eventually became a disgrace.Seriously why such things happen with me  and  please tell me how could i get out of all this and  be like the person i used to be and get my life back on track","109":"Why do people care about my marks?Iam 17 but my weight is only 42 kg's, they never feed me the things I want.

Some say that its a Chinese bioweapon gone rogue , that's why chinese have denied access for the international probe.Some say that its the Chinese way of staying ahead of the US in terms of economy , because Chinese are far ahead in terms of covid timeline which gives them a jumpstart , as they resume operations when countries like India shuts down .Some say that its the US way of planting its own virus in china , in order to create a global hate , which in some sense has been achieved and inorder to disrupt the foreign economies , by taking advantage of other countries . Take for example : Facebook's investment in India , rise in Bezozs Wealth , Google domination , Microsoft pills. Some say that its a show of supremacy like if America shuts down , so will the entire world go down . Some say that Capitalism has brought this inorder to show that You are born and dead just to contribute your part in the overflated economy . Because we can see so many people telling how economies will kill more people than Covid .Some say that Modiji has a political motive behind national wide lockdown , while he could have given states the power to do as they pleased with centre's guidance because we can see his approval ratings has risen more than Uri effect . People are now lighting lamps , clapping hands if he tells. Well I guess that he is really Smart.Some experts say 60 million ICU beds would have been required if this lockdown wasn't imposed that will take atleast 15 normal years of medicial infrastructure growth to facilitate that . Because we know that India lacks in medical infrastructure .Some says that its the nature's way of reacting to man made pollutions , as we all  see now the ozone layer fixing itself and the pollution coming all down.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm....All of these thoughts were like from yesterday...Or is it my mistake that all these thoughts broke out. Yet I still don't know the truth , I was a simple guy then......After knowing this much , I continue to stare at the only mirror in my room , in which I have been locked down for 40 years. I don't smile , I don't cry , I don't have any emotions Its 2041 now , I guess , I don't knowIts just me and my face on the mirror , I don't know what is happening on the outside world , I don't know how are my parents are holding up physically , in the other rooms . They don't speak with each other too.. Probably they would also be staring at the mirror like me or they would have forgotten the fact that I still live . Because I myself don't know if they even exist.Its just a Photo that reminds me that I and my parents existed in this so called world i was born into, I still wonder why was I even born ? Is it to have the same thought process all these years.My cells have adopted , my body doesn't require as much as food , sleep or anything that I would have had 20 years back . I don't know how the food comes , it just comes . It was like yesterday when the first Covid patient died I used to be a 21 year old guy then , from a middle class family.With so many complex problems that I had to face Being single , girlfriend , sex , love , job , cooking, money, dad , sister, caste , reservations , marks , grades , professors , social acceptance , wanna be rich , powerful , famous ..........were all the obstacle I had at that time , which I still believe to have because all of that made me realise that I was either stupid or I was living life like how general audience would live theirs.But here I am, still looking at the only mirror in my room... as all these thoughts pass by daily . It started with my sister , she was Covid positive , and after that , we were put in quarrentine , but I had a connection with the world then . I got the newspapers, the nurses told me stuffs . But after Some months everything stopped . I don't see the nurses too. Hope she's doing well. Hope she's aliveI have never seen or heard anything since then .The last time I heard about something in a very long time ,  was in 2036 when they said that they were shifting me because the place where I stayed had been affected by the rising water level and that half of Antarctica had swallowed up most of the major cites of the world.I don't know how the world is now .I don't know if my sister is alive or dead , the last time I saw her was when she was holding my hands in fear , I kissed her and told her that you'll come back soon and healthy .I think Covid was just first of its kind and after that many more, with power more infinite than its earlier impact , has taken a stroll on this insane world , with different outcomes . I wonder if there's a America or India now?Guess what if our prime minister is even alive ? I still don't know \" How do I still remain sane.\" After all these madness and Illusions I have been through.Its probably the drug injected food . Here I am still emotionless , staring at the same only mirror , with the hope that I could give my body its peace but all I can see in this empty room is that there's no means to end my meaningless life , rotted by the selfishness of some people who run or think that they run this empty world . I guess I would have had a normal life or a better life if I just had the proper amount of money and power back then.I have accepted the reality that this is my new illusion which I should feel real just like those old days.Is it just me ? Or is it.............","111":"I\u2019ve been on both sides. Severely depressed, suicidal everyday and feeling completely and utterly disconnected from reality. Saw a fast car coming towards me and got excited.Hypomanic (off an antidepressant), dancing to silence and wanting to go on an adventure. Content, even though I was still in my dissociated state that made me depressed in the first place, and sociable even though I can barely hold a conversation while depressed. Conversations require interest, and I\u2019m barely interested in anything, much less generic people. This made me realize that life is literally brain chemistry. There are people who get abused and become serial killers and others who get abused and run a shelter or something. There are people living in a hut in India happier than our miserable 1st world asses. Nature vs. Nurture. I think Nature wins.","112":"I took up engineering when I was 16. I thought at the time that is what I wanted to do. After I graduated, I was pressurized by my family to study further. To make a quick decision. So I went ahead and applied for a Masters at Columbia University in NYC. I got through and decided to go, because come on I always dreamt of living In NYC. I graduated earlier than the rest of my classmates, got a good job, I worked at for 3 years. I was great at my job. But it didn\u2019t fulfill me. My father has a business in construction, I was forced by my mother to come back to India. \u201cDo this work for your dad instead for someone else\u201d Now because I am the only child, I thought it is my duty to stay close to my parents. Also it was a super attractive option for me to be working for my business (albeit my dad\u2019s but it wouldn\u2019t feel like a job) came back. In the last few months my father\u2019s business declined due to fall in economy in India. Now my mother is forcing me to take a job. I have dreams to start my own business. I have many plans. It is not going to be in my field, but because my masters course was half management, I feel confident to start my own business (I have done market study to see the feasibility and I am confident with some investment I will be able to make a profit in a year). I just want to make it happen, i know it will make me happy, I know that even if it fails, I will be happy in the future that I atleast tried and it wasn\u2019t just a \u201cwhat if\u201d.Now while I work on setting up my business (of course i can do the ground work only after all this quarantining is done) my mother has been extremely negative and demoralizes every single day. She tells me they wasted the money on me that they spent on my education. That I should work in a job. That I am a waste of education and space. It does hurt and mess with me a lot. It makes me doubt myself. Am i making a mistake by choosing a diff career that what I studied? Will I regret doing this later? I don\u2019t know. I only feel a bit cheated that I left my fairly comfortable life back in NYC to come back and now am being forced into a very competitive low paying market just because my mother wants so. I have been getting some suicidal thoughts but I know I need to power through these dark times. Anyway, sorry for the long ass post. I am sure no one had the time to go through all this but damn it feels good to vent. Thank you.","113":"There is so much to say I actually don't know where to start. I am 19 years old(20 in September),in 1st year of engineering in India. Since 2016(11th grade),somehow I have done just nothing. I had been an above average student,  but somehow I just started procrastinating,being completely shy, introvert and turned into a complete daydreamer.My grades started getting worse, started failing subjects, started having hair loss, getting fat, no personal life or relationships.2016 and 2017 just went by procrastinating, academically failure, and simply just blank. I used to just sit with an open book and just couldn't study, used to play football, used to read novels, but just wouldn't felt like doing, the only I wanted was to just sit in my room and do nothing. So by 2018 I finished  school with low grades,  failed all entrance exams, for the universities I wanted to go. So In 2018 I decided to just take a gap, and to get out of the the mental hell I have put myself into. I realised I was depressed  .Being 18 with no aim,no specific talent, academically failure, from a financially mediocre family so nothing like ever I have spend money on myself and father also retired, and shy person I was,  forget girlfriend,i don't think I even Know a girl whom I can call a friend.Many times I have cried myself to sleep. Realising what a person I have become,  I just felt suicidal. The only reason I didnt do it probably was, all the things I was going through were my own fucking problems.Like I never gone through any physical or mental abuse, never have done drugs, smoking or alcohol, and have decent loving parents.Just a normal guy,but somehow over thinking I turned myself into a loser.But I just accepted the fact that I am depressed,  but suicide is just isn't options.I just accepted that I am not going to have the best life I thought of,  but the least now I wanted was to get financially get stable,  to support me and family. I accepted that being with a girl or having a relationship is just not my cup of tea and just decided that from now on I just focus on studies and go through university,  get a job and live on my own. In 2019 I joined a mediocre college(engineering), and somehow accepting what I can have,  what I cannot has helped a lot,  but It just becomes difficult to study things which you actually don't like but u just have to do,  cuz you have failed earthing others. Somehow 2019 went by passing semester somehow, at least one thing to get pleased,but if I'll be true to myself,  I myself know that I am not happy. I wake up sulking knowing another day of doing things which I don't want to,  but somehow I have to. But by March 2020 I have felt really interested in studing computer science, and with that the start of lock down,  I decided to do online courses so as to get my appropriate skills and improve my resume.But because old habits don't go so easily,  today it's April 26 and I haven't studied single line the whole time,  just have procrastinated everything.I don't know how to say but I just feel so bad of myself. Right now,  I want to just forget all the past and  focus all my time for studying and probably in 2-3 years get a job,  and that's reason I wrote all of this, I want to start fresh.Hope writing this helps me.","114":"This is long. I am sorry. If you read through this and leave me a comment, I will make a donation to a mental health charity, clinic or research facility. I have some spare money and this might help someone. This long mindvomit is not urgent. I just felt like I needed to 'diary' it. I have been diagnosed with a depression and anxiety disorder.  Depression runs in my family, even my great grandma was in an institution. I had my first incident with depression in my childhood, around 12 years old. 12 years old life was good. Had friends, played guitar, rode skateboard , read books, started learning computers. But suddenly it all stopped. Didn't bring a notepad to school. no pen. no bag. stopped caring. Stopped everything, became empty. Went to a psych ward, where I was diagnosed with the above.Then trying to hide the reality of me being 'insane' and trying to forget, fit in and never to repeat, please.Second bout od hardcore depression came two years ago, after I burned out from work. Afterwards, me and my girlfriend have traveled the world. Trips of a lifetime for most. Asia, America, Europe. Amazing experiences for most . And I only had like 5 seconds of hapiness after all the experinces and achievments we had. (ie. we trekked 15 days to see a specific vista in Himalayas). My mind just doesn't care. I have lost the light taht keeps people going. I just smile and nod to make my gf happy. She is ecstatic. I don't want to destroy her hapiness. I fake my emotions, because I am empty inside.I am now medicated by cipralex. It took away some  of my anxiety and left me kinda without the everlasting pressure in my chest and left me emptier than I thought it would. It left me scared and tired.Previous medication left me impotent and tired.Work is good, they know my condition. They understand it. I am a software developer. I can work when I feel like it and make enough to keep me going.Love of my life is with me for 13 years and we are planning a wedding and children.I just came back from my friend's flat, where I kidnapped all of the possible conversation and just twisted it to talk about my depression. I am sorry I destroyed a pottentianly fun evening. Every topic I kidnapped and destroyed. In the end I had to beg them to stop me. My gf is getting overworked and because of my melancholic passivity, she's showing signs of depression too. (depressed feelings, not clincal) I am sure she got it from me.. She cries, nothing excites her. I can't make a fun schedule I'd be able to follow and make her happy. Our relationship, which is basically the only thing that is worth something in my life is slipping through my fingers.I tried everything I could find about making your life better. I joined a gym, I went to therapy. I talked to my family. I am on my third psychiatrist and fifth medication. I ran every day. I tried interminent fasting. I went to India to practice yoga and also meditation. All of these things I forced myself to stick with for atleast three months. Most of the time it stressed me so much I coulndn't sleep the night before whatever I was supposed to the next day rendering it useless.Lately, I wake up every day with a vivid image of me with a noose around my neck, rope swung around a tree branch, the other end hanging in front of me. I am trying to climb the other end. This situation comes up before me brain boots up. It is buried in my subconscience. I never realistically thought of killing myself. But the image is there every day. It doesn't even physically work. You can't lift yourself trying to climb the other end. Still I wake up and it is burned into my mind. I am laying in bed kinda paralyzed, my limbs heavy in a meditative state which I didn't attempt. I lay there, kinda sleeping , kinda awake, contemplating the physical paradox of trying to climb the other end and somehow maybe hanging myself. If I am not forced from bed, I do that for 2 or more hours until I need to pee. I'm not gonna kill myself , never thought I would. It's gonna get better. Life can be fun.I started drinking heavily, just to feel something. I started smoking for whatever stupid reason. I got introduced to cocaine, which I never thought I would come into contact with.I stopped being able to do even the minimal amount of work I am supposed to do. I go to my personal office, I freak out, that I should be doing something. I smoke a shitton of cancersticks, drink rum, get angry at myself for wrecking my productive day, do cocaine to start working... aaaand repeat all of the above. This became my daily schedule. I am not yet addicted heavily. If I leave this routine, I don't have to smoke, drink or do drugs. But when left with my own devices, I numb myself, trying to get an emotion, which would be fake anyway. But I just fuck myself up, knowing I shouldn't, before, knowing I shouldn't have after. Then do the same the next day. This might look regular to some, but I am abusing everything right now, puking at 3pm in my own office.  Worst is, the next day, I try destroy myself again. I am on a trajectory to hell. I am gonna wreck myself.But weirdly, when I thought of all the destructive shit I am doing, I found solace and hope in the final result.I am gonna destroy myself into nothing. Place, from which is no other way than up.I am gonna drink until I puke. I am gonna smoke until I am sick. I am gonna do the line and hate myself. I will become the worst bundle of shit the world has ever seen. And then I will start anew.And then appreciate everything but the above .-------I showered - good, atleast you didnt drink all day, masking problems, trying to find an emotion.I cooked - good, atleast I did something productive and didn't smoke a pack trying to kill myself with cancer.I went for a walk - good, atleast I didn't do hard drugs, lying to myself I need it just to do my job.--------I know this is a wrong, bad idea, but it is where I am heading. I just need to hang onto something real before I get there. But will I? What do I want to hear from you? Is there anything that can possibly enlighten or help me here? I am probably just spilling my story here, just to be heard.EDIT: bunch of typos, am on mobile.","115":"I have abusive parents, they fight with each other, my family is fucked up all are selfish and we are divided due to family conflicts, i haven't seen my cousin sister 5 years younger to me for 1 year I really miss her this is due to family conflicts again. I am preparing for IIT-JEE its an competitive exam in india to get selected in prestigious universities in India but my preparation is almost fucked up and this is due to lack of concentration , depression, low confidence and most importantly PROCASTINATION.....My teachers say i have potential to crack the exam and also i have 1 year more to prepare for it nicely but i have no energy and motivation left My parents keep on demotivating me by saying  How can you crack this tough exam you are so dumb and all. I agree I haven't given my best and its all my fault that i have ruined my life I am tired pleaseee motivate me i dont wanna die i get suicidal thoughts every now and then and also I have Porn Addiction (i have recently joined r\/NoFap and i am on day 8 today)  i googled my problems but i dont think they have provided me a good idea ......finally i just want to become more productive and motivatedAlso my parents are abusive and they just dont care much about me they are just ready to provide my cash for education and all but dont care about my feelings at all i guess this is because of illiteracy","116":"Hi everyone! My name is Mike (22 yo) and I am one of those who find it extremely difficult and depressing to study alone at home during quarantine. I tried to create a group for anyone who wants to work\/study with other people because I personally find it easier and more motivating. I want to ask you to help me with studying and I will help you in return. I bought a premium on zoom so that we can have 24\/7 study meetings non-stop, join and leave whenever you want (not gonna charge anything for this at all, never-ever). This zoom study room was created just a few days ago and it already had 2 meetings with wonderful and positive people from around the world: Australia, United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, India, France, Italy, United States and more. Right now there are more than 130 participants which join meetings using video at convenient for them time, so someone is always online and working.In addition, I know how hard this can be in times of complete lockdown... I couldn't properly study for last 3 weeks, since the beginning of the quarantine. During my university times I used to go to the library all the time, and now this, without seeing friends, family, loved ones for weeks (I am an international student). Honestly speaking, so far zoom helped me a bit, at least when I seat and turn my video on - I actually start working by seeing that other people are also working. Feel free to add me to your contacts using the link below and I will add you to our group as soon as I see.

Also been told I have BPD. Also I'm suicidal even when  I'm not depressed. Meds and psychotherapy have had not stopped me from trying to kill myself. I dropped out of college and most of my friends have cut ties with me. I'm trying to find help here cause I don't I have anything to lose.","118":"I was born in a little town off the coast of India, a wee little lad, I was always happy, and playful, until I made it into preschool, where for the first few months the teachers here told me that I was pretty bright, and intelligent and will succeed in all my endeavours. Fast forward to a few months later, then the crap started. I was bullied, a lot, A LOT, everyday it was for a new reason. We have a small race here in India called the Tamilians, and I lived in a city where people from the same heritage were hated ( for this and many other reasons I did not know), and every single day I was bullied to death, beaten up, verbally abused for absolutely no reason at all. Every single day in school was hell to me. Some people miss their school, i am afraid of mine. Nobody was ever friends with me, so one day I made up a story about having visited and resided in the USA, for some reason everybody suddenly wanted to talk to me, asked me about how it was, for once I had people who wanted to talk to me. So I continued forging story after story, filled end to end with lies, and never stopped. To this day people know me as someone who's partially American. I was never really good at anything, at all, no sports, I play video games with a few friends, but I'm always made fun of because I suck. Everytime I try to soul my guys about why I'm sad I get labelled as an attention seeker or sympathy seeker and get made fun of and ignored again. Until today I haven't done a single thing that makes my parents proud to state the fact that I am their son, I've always ended up disappointing my father, who worked very very hard to bring us to the comfort we have now. You don't even have to ask me about my love life, topping this all off with around 12-14 rejections all from various diff girls. All I ever want is for people to like me and consider me as a friend. I have never had someone who I can call my best friend, and he or she the same. Havent had anyone except family show any sort of concern about me. I'm 19 now, and I am still made fun of all the time, still lonely, still powerless, still, a loser. I've always had dreams or goals, but I could never achieve them, my mother thought I was messed up in the head and took me through a psych analysis. People always roast me or make fun of me for trying to live off pity. So I've decided that I don't need pity if I am frickin dead. I'm almost rock solid about my decision to kill myself.If you were in such a situation, what would you do ? Honestly, after seeing my own dad cry  twice in front of my own eyes, I've decided that I have nothing to live for. Just waiting for the opportunity...","119":"Hii myself ABISHEK I am 24yr old from...I am under depression since 8yrs ...anyone from India","120":"My girlfiend, who I have to marry this year (her family's pressure, mostly) knows that I'm depressed, and I have some horribly severe episodes. She doesn't quite understand it though. I don't fault her for that, because I don't think anyone other than a depressed person or a mental health professional has any idea about it at all.&amp;#x200B;She's also a wonderful, honest and conscientious person...... believes in hard work and pulling your weight. I made the mistake of talking to her about my issues... only at a surface level, like how I'm feeling hopeless and anxious over my career. Bad Idea. The moment she said \"you'll never get better if you think like this\", I told her that her honesty is nice, but I'd appreciate it if she doesn't talk like that. She didn't take it well, and just unloaded on me (she's a hot-head, and winds up saying things she sometimes regrets). Long story short, she just said she's \"sorry for trying to help\", and that I should see a professional, because she can't talk to me. I guess she was offended when I asked her not to say things like that...I totally understand my own fault here, I knew she wouldn't understand some things..... and I maybe I should have spoken differently. This has happened before, so I guess I should've seen it coming.&amp;#x200B;Now, I'm lost wondering as to what I should do about all this. She's a good woman, so are her parents (this matters in India people, trust me!). My family loves her, and we have had a relationship of several years. I'm not too happy about where I am in life - career wise - in fact, I feel my career is dead and I can't do anything about it. I'm also severely depressed, and no medication seems to work. Venlafaxine works, but makes me completely emotionless and apathetic. I don't know what to do about this relationship now. It's all just too much to bear.Even if I marry this girl, what will I do? I just feel like I'll spend my days going through the motions of whatever is expected of a son, a worker, a husband....... and I'll need to constantly seek help for all of this, without feeling any connection anywhere.What can I do?","121":"I am 18 years old from India. From a long time, especially the last 2 months, i have been really depressed and anxious about the future. I have a 16 y\/o sister, whom i really love and care about. From last 1.5 year, she has been in a relationship with a boy who is 1 year older than me. My mother knows about this relationship, and she had no option, but to support it. My father, however, is completely unaware of this, and thinks that his daughter is very \"good\" in that sense. Both my father and my sister's boyfriend are complete bigots and full on narcissists. If my father got cognizant of the hidden relationship, he will do things, that even upon thinking, i hyperventilate and get anxious. On the other hand, my sister's bf constantly blackmails her into keeping up the relationship, that she is now REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN. However, i don't think that he blackmails for other more private stuff.  The basis of his blackmail is that he will tell my father about the whole relationship thing. Which, consequently, will make us all (me, my mother, my sister) liars in his eyes, which is BAD, SERIOUSLY BAD. My anxiety is crippling me, i am all the time tired, no motivations and no will to fight. It's like i am imploding, not exploding: i don't cry at all, i just sit and my body feels like it's getting more and more hollow. We run a pharmaceutical business, so after some research, i self prescribed a dose of pregabalin to reduce anxiety, without the need of acquiring a prescription. I have been taking it for like 5 days and it is showing lil effects. In January, most probably, her bf will go to Canada for study purposes, which will subside this whole mess. As of now, he has made attempts to call my father to tell him about all that, but he never said anything on phone, and just hanged up the call. There are less chances of him actually calling my father, cos he knows that it will certainly end the relationship. My sister is not at all interested in the relationship. She never ever complaints thought, thinking that it would make my mother and me anxious. She is very brave. Truly. My mother, who has suffered all her life from my ass father, also gets anxious and worried about the future. She also suffers from migraines, so more stress causes real bad headaches. Both of them are very brave and they are fighting for what could happen. But, I am not, I get super scared and anxious when all this happens. I don't know how to normalize, and feel ok. It's like eating me. Sometimes i think of real bad stuff happening to both the bigots, and sometimes i feel as cuffed and restrained. I know it's not life and death matter, but it's certainly not comfortable also. There is this fear that always lingers, about what would happen. Sorry, if this situation is not worthy of being with all of the other horrible situations, that people here go through.I am not even reading this, so sorry if there are some mistakes.","122":"Tl;dr : I don't have anyone with have with whome I can share this. So I'm posting it here.Hi,I want to share a secret which is killing me. I don't have anyone right now.... So I'm posting it here.6Years ago I met this girl who later became my best best friend. We were inseparable. People often taught that we were a couple. When I met her she told me that she was out of a \"bad and controlling relationship\". Other than that everything was normal.3 Years after that we were even more close. I started developing feelings for her,at first it was really confusing and I had to keep quiet because she is from an orthodox bramin(cast) family. If they ever find out that she is dating a non bramin they would kick her out. I just suppressed my feelings untill we both were about to graduate.Just few months before our graduation. The way she spoke felt like signals... Anybody would say thay they were signals.\" I like you, I love you, I hope I can stay with you, I really feel safe with you\". So I tought that she really likes me too and  I told her that I like her and I would like to take her out on a date. She abruptly rejected me and told me that \" Sorry if you have taken my friendship the wrong way, it's on me...I'm really sorry\".Because of everything that happened before... the way we were... Idiot me didn't understand the situation and tought that she is just afraid of her family(This situation often happens in India). So after a lot of discussion we came to a conclusion. The idea was something like \"if I can get into an IIT (India's best tech school) I would get to ask her on a date.\" ~ Which roughly translates to, get successful and you might get me.That day was the happiest day of my life. I tough thay she is afraid of her family... and guess what she is !!! Why else would she say thay I'll get a date if I get into an IIT.Fast forward, I'm still working hard everyday just so that I can be with her. I truly loved her \ud83e\udd7a. She was my one true love. I spent most of my time with her chatting.Just days before my exam I figured out something really gruesome. She still loves her EX. She had to break up with him because her parents didn't accept his cast.But still she loves him and is waiting for him. I FELT BROKEN... EVERYTHING WAS A LIE.... She could have told me that she likes someone else. Insted she gave me a fake promise. THAT MOMENT I REALISED THAT I WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMOTIONAL REPLACEMENT.She apologized to me and told me that she didn't tell it to anyone and it is a secret. It felt like the person I loved doesn't exist in this reality all of this just was just a drama. I didn't have anyone... I can't tell my mom because she is already messed up. And friends... She is my best friend \ud83d\ude22. Exam was done I messed it up, I joined one of the best colleges in my country but. Unsatisfied I just moved what I had.About her, I just accepted the fact that it happened and still wanted her in my life. We were still talking and I was getting over her... I went on some dates met some awesome people. It was all nice. UNTILL one day I got a call from her.... She happily told me \"I got back with my boy friend \". She didn't even care about my feelings. Shit stared happening I got into depressed and often get panic attacks...  Dropped out of college. All of a sudden the successful smart guy became nothing.I recently told her not to contact me anymore... I do not feel good. I am hollow. I want to hurt myself for being an idiot. I cry everynight thinking about this.I have no friends, no girl friend , I lost my career. While she is happy... She is really happy. I wanted to say this to someone. I know it will get better with time... But I feel betrayed. I just die and haunt her forever \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dEdit : Hey, People !! it's been few weeks and I am really fine and happy now. I am working on myself, I'm sure that I'll be even more happy in future.Thank you for all your love.Edit 2: Oct 2020Hey people... I was at the lowest point of my life when I wrote this post.it has been few months since I wrote it  so I just wanted to come back and write what is going on with my life... it might help someone who is going through the same situation.In my previous edit I mentioned that I am working on myself, guess what !!! It worked out, I got into one of India's top 10 tech Institute [fyi the previous college that I dropped out of had a national ranking below 50]. I am soo happy that strangers online help me get out of my shitty depression. Now I am kind of scared of girls\/relationship..  I have a hard time trusting them... But I'm sure that things will get better with time. I am also planing for migration to another country. I am really happy now.... ***The one who is reading this right now, if you are sad and your life is fucked up, don't worry things will get better.... just work hard***","123":"hi this is my first post here . I'm 19 from India , I'd like to ask why do undeserving people seem happier than those who deserve . I often find myself asking this question over and over again and tbh this makes me feel like doing good to the world gives you nothing not even happiness and then it makes me think that if I'd be bad then it'd give me happiness , i have been raised well i know what morals are and how it gives you happiness deep within but still I find myself confused thinking would it all even matter in the end , who's keeping check of whom here after all .","124":"I am Legally Blind in one eye (Amblyopia) so I denied Driving license in my Country India. So I feel like I am not normal like others, I am not worthy like others, I should not Mingle with others, I feel Inferior to others. So I don't Deserve to Eat Food too.I want to End my Life by Not Eating Anything and Drinking Water.","125":"I suffer from clinical depression. I don't know if you could empathize with me but I often feel severely depressed reading about Islam and its growth in this world. Islam has caused so much harm to humankind and it continues to do so. This is highly depressing.Every day, there are Muslim fanatics either trying to convert non-Muslims (they call them __Kaafirs__) to Islam or kill them in the name of jihad. Muslims do not integrate into the country they migrate to; instead, they try to take over and convert it into an Islamic state. This is why the situation in Europe is so worrying. Angela Merkel started the madness of bringing in hundreds of thousands of 'rapefugees' into the EU and is single-handedly responsible for starting the obliteration of European cultural values. What's even worse is that Muslims outbreed the native population significantly. They don't believe in condoms (supposedly unholy) nor family planning.Britain especially is seriously screwed. There's a jihadist attack almost every other day, Muslim rape gangs molest and rape young white girls and extremists want to introduce Sharia law. They even held a protest in favor of Sharia and displayed a huge banner with the words \"Jesus was a Muslim\".In my home country of India, Muslims are a minority comprising 14% of the population. Many of them are anti-India and pro-Pakistan. They do not tolerate any other religion. It's not safe anymore to practice your religion in or near Muslim-majority neighborhoods. Our government is trying to introduce a law that would grant citizenship to minorities fleeing religious persecution in the Islamic states of Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Indian Muslims are going berserk, vandalizing property and hurting innocent civilians.The purpose of religion is to make good human beings out of us all. In that regard, Islam is failing. I would argue that Islam is a regressive political ideology masquerading as a religion.I have stopped consuming the news. It was degrading my mental health reading and watching all those Muslim atrocities. But even now, memories come back to haunt me. I feel helpless like I can't do anything about it. Politically correct leaders around the world are failing us.So, have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you get out of it and move on? How did you find inner peace?","126":"I feel like I'm close to another little 'break down', it's the kind where I just scream and cry, curl up and just lie on the floor for a while. I have no idea if this is common for people (I'm still new to talking about this shit O.O). Anyhow, I've been depressed for as long as I remember and I was cutting myself for a long time but haven't in a little over 4 years or so. But lately the urge has been a bit too much, I won't lie, it's gotten easier over the years, because I really didn't want to add more scars (I FINALLY started wearing short sleeves and stuff out in public, maybe a year and a half ago).. It doesn't help I don't have any ganja, I live in the Netherlands and the 'coffeeshops' (I still don't know why they call it that, I probably looked it up once but forgot) have been forced to close down due to the pandemic, but ganja was working pretty well for me. Some strains made my anxiety or paranoia worse, or sometimes when I'd smoke too much, but at least 75% of the time it made me feel much calmer and helped me to enjoy my day at least a little, make things bearable.. I also have back pains and other random little pains that I can shrug off when I'm slightly stoned (I rarely get completely stoned, think I might have a high tolerance or something). So anyhow, that sucks. I quit drinking beer a few months ago because it became a problem and so now I'm down to only chocolate which is soooooort of comforting but I can eat an entire bar and then just feel like I'm ready to cry while also jumping all the way to the moon from the sugar rush (I eat very healthy stuff most of the time, so when I eat something chocolaty or sugary it's like.. WOOOOOSHHH!!). &amp;#x200B;And don't get me started on the corona thing T\\_T (don't worry, I got myself started anyway, this is a weird statement why do people make this.. why am I doing it?!) ... anyhow, all those damn idiots hoarding food and toilet paper, my boyfriend finally managed to find some toilet paper today and some dried red lentils (which is one of our staple foods) and it stresses me out so much.. and I worry one of these days we're going to be out of something and we have very little, we've been very low on money these past few months especially (we've never had a lot to spare anyway) and I'm always craving comfort foods and stuff that I can't have and to then run out of basic things is really unpleasant :( &amp;#x200B;Also I just moved from Scotland (my boyfriend and I moved there initially and I was super hopeful and he got a cool job but then he quit and we quickly ran into money problems again and now we had to go back again because things weren't working out and blablabla) and my friends, the only real friends I've made in YEARS, are now all far away.. Two of them are still in the UK (one was going to India but now she couldn't because of virus stuff) and the other is somewhere super remote in Norway (good for him though, I think) and I really miss them every day and I'm not on any social media, I don't have a phone, I only use email (I just recently started posting here on Reddit out of sheer desperation, hi...) to talk to my mom (I don't call my parents cus I rrrrrreeeeaaaally hate phones and especially talking on a phone) so I've been extra lonely.. my boyfriend has to work a lot, especially now because co-workers are getting sick and taking extra measures not to infect people.. because he works with sick kids and nobody can risk infecting them which is another worry of mine! I'm so scared he's gonna catch the virus from some random person in the supermarket or something and then spread it to the kids without knowing it and they could die from it and I honestly don't know if I could live with that..On the bright side, he won't get it from me.. I haven't left the house in weeks, months(?) I don't even know.. I went outside with him, a few weeks ago, to go to the stores.. and I think we went for a walk in the woods once.. Today I stood out in the garden for a few minutes.. but sometimes I get so nervous or scared or both for no good reason that I don't even like being near the windows where people could possibly see me. &amp;#x200B;I'm turning 31 next month... I thought my last birthday was somewhat of a miracle because I used to say I wouldn't make it past 30.. But also.. we arrived in Scotland on my birthday (I even had cake, yay!) and I was so hopeful and optimistic about everything.. Before we left I made some good changes, I was eating well, lifting weights, I was growing my hair and my beard (yeah, I'm a boy, lemme know if I surprised you, cus that might make me smile) both of which were very bushy and full and then I got sick, a week (maybe two at most) after we arrived and was stuck in bed for a whole week or something and it was awful and I fell back into my old habits soon after that. It all went downhill from there. I shaved my beard because it became very annoying while I was sick and struggled to eat, later that year I also cut my long hair after my boyfriend's mother commented on my grey hairs (why do people insist on pointing that out?!) and while I used the excuse of ''I wanted to try short hair'' and told everyone that I would have regretted not cutting it also (which is partly true).. I miss my long hair so much.. it was almost at the longest length I've had before and I really wanted to go beyond that.. &amp;#x200B;Another random annoying thing; my twitchy eye has returned, it started a few years ago and came and went, but it's back now and it really bugs me.. always my right eye, feels like it's the lower right corner but I'm not entirely sure (haven't really bothered looking in the mirror, cus I don't like looking in the mirror half the time ofc).. &amp;#x200B;Anyhow, I gotta eat dinner now and this is probably not a ''little'' rant and I might delete it or whatever later if that's possible.. but I expect it to be buried below the other posts and that's fine with me.. honestly, even if people comment (hi again), what exactly is that going to do for me? I'm too much of a hermit, maybe I'll leave it on as a form of exposure therapy.","127":"So essentially about 6 months or so back I moved from india to usa. I'm in a midwest state. I moved cause I got a green card and everyone told me not to give that up. I got my first job (fresh outta college) and I moved. My parents are back home, all my friends are back, the person i love is also back home. I feel alone most of the time. I spent today evening crying thinking what did i do to end up here and be in this situation. Also to add to this, my family back home is really going through financial hardship (indian economy is screwed and the middle class - upper middle to lower middle took the worst hit). I dont want to tell my parents anything cause they themselves have way too much to deal with. Also I think pretty soon they're gonna loose the house I spent 22 years of my life in. I dont know what to do. I feel so trapped. All I do is run my body on autopilot and just do the minimal to exist and do my job. I want to take steps go gain more skills and improve my situation but all I do is fucking cry and feel like shit. These feelings peaked today. I was mainly suppressing these feelings so that I could function but I couldn't today. Nothing really triggered it. All I did was take a nap and wake up crying. I usually wake up feeling fucked up.Sometimes I go to sleep hopin I wouldn't wake up. Or wake up back home and this is all an emotional nightmare. I think I surely missed out on some other details but I hope this paints a picture of my situation. Any advice on this would be appreciated. Thank you for reading! Hope everyone gets through whatever they're going through.","128":"I have been troubled since my teens but it was never anything serious as in it never had any effect on my ongoing life, or so i thought. I am from India so like most of Indian kids the problem for me began after i completed my high school (10th standard). I was always interested in arts. Most of it was due to the fact that my mother reads a lot and was a very good painter (stopped after she married). I was an average painter but pretty good with pencil art and cartoons particularly. I also spent a lot of time reading classical literature mainly horror and Oscar Wilde. So, naturally i wanted to take arts as my stream in senior secondary and study English literature. I was good in sports and won a few school tournaments. My results were above average too as i scored 90% so my father decided I must take science and be an engineer. I resisted and try to explain him but he got all fired up and things got physical. Just as i was about to punch him my mom stopped me and told me not to and I couldn't say no. I took science and in a few months decided to prepare for several entrance exams for some architecture schools as it was the closest to being in the creative field since i was never gonna score enough marks to enter a literature school. I cleared the exam too with and all India rank of 4k something which was decent to get me a good private college or the low tier govt institutes. So again it was denied by my father and i was forced to take up engineering in computer science as i was good in programming. It's all been downhill from there. I smoke heavily and drink more than i should. It was worse while i was in college where I had my first meal in a bar before i drank to the point i felt nothing. I could walk easily to room no matter how much i drank and sleep in peace. I stopped that and switched to weed. Till then I had performed horribly but managed to perform well in my major project and even presented it in a conference. After that I've felt nothing. I don't have a job. I don't feel like studying, I don't read anymore,  Whenever i pick up a pencil i feel like my hands are gone. I can't draw shit anymore. I used to draw a line and then another and it used to fall together into a picture but now i can't even draw a decent landscape anymore. My hands start shaking and i can't feel the picture in my head anymore. I used to have a journal which I've stopped updating around 2 years ago so i don't write anymore too. My Les Paul has been lying in a corner and i noticed today that the frets have been completely damaged by fungus. I wake up everyday, cook my breakfast (my only meal), take a bath, smoke weed till midnight while listening to some punk, grunge and motorhead.  I'm tired of  telling myself that you're a man, deal with it. I pushed all my friends who tried to help me away from my life, broke up after school and never felt sexually anything after that. I feel like all my feelings are dead except the anger. I close my eyes and all i see is red which feels darker than black and feel this constant stream of rage and all i want is to break things or whip myself with a belt. I hate everyone around me and now I don't even go to birthdays or any occasion as I'm sick of trying to act normal and fit in. I just sit in my room and stare into my laptop screen playing games like a zombie, some days drunk and mostly stoned. Now even these two don't work for me and I'm thinking of getting into going heavier stuff. I know this is wrong but I can't help myself and have no one to talk to as i don't even talk to my parents anymore. I don't need any charity I just wanted to get these things out of my brain to people who have no idea who i am. So, thank you if you took the time to read this. Have a good day.","129":"20 M final year computer engineering student,India.Everyone says that \"you matter\" but I don't believe what it means and I don't believe that at all.is really literally everyone matters?I am not talking about universe's some scientific theory way or god's great plan way but from the point of that person's living through satisfied life way.Because I have first hand experienced that if you don't have knowledge,money,love,power, beauty [physical appearance],sense of humour or even people pleasing qualities nobody have any business with you.I have been a people pleaser and attention seeker a for my whole life and now I simply just can't do it.since I have dropped people pleasing here and there I don't do any thing.i realized and came as incompetent and looked down guy in every aspect of life.say it such friendship,career, family, values.everything.I don't play good with people in group like sport team or my college project team.keep them hanging and being dead weight not finishing my part of work,being late ,not contributing.And don't forget the deadly combination of complexes and bad habits(no addictions aside from mobile phone and constant need of entertainment).It's living hell.i can't tell every detail here but it's pretty bad.i not suicidal per se because that requires certain degree of courage and will power.Am I fixable?

My best friend and her boyfriend as well as one other guy are living with me, and that\u2019s why I am able to afford to live here.Despite it helping me for a while I inevitably started struggling with the usual stuff again after a few months, and that\u2019s when her boyfriend really started to show his colors in terms of what he thought of me.Her boyfriend is an extremely practical, very numbers-kind of guy, and also, according to the way he talks to me, never forgets anything or makes honest mistakes.I do understand that I need to be better about things, remember to do them on time and such, but the way he talks to me makes me almost not want to do them because I feel even less motivation or drive to get the fuck up and do them. It takes all of the VERY little energy I have and crushes it.Sometimes it even happens that I am doing a task and accomplishing something well for once and he messages telling me to do it NOW and it just undermines my whole feeling good that I\u2019m out of bed, doing something and being healthy.He has,in the past,said things to me like:\u201cThe great lindsey manages to mess up again!\u201d\u201cHow do you not remember to do this thing? Are you stupid?\u201d\u201cYOU FORGOT TO TAKE YOUR LAUNDRY OUT AGAIN???\u201d*yes in all capsThis happens in a group chat that everyone sees.I\u2019ve told my best friend how I feel and while she says she understands, she obviously sticks up for him a bit because she sleeps with him, spends every day with him, has feelings for him, etc.She chalks a lot of it up to his cultural background (he\u2019s from India) and says that he\u2019s just like that, but I often feel as if she dismisses the fact that I don\u2019t even like being around him because I feel he despises me and thinks I\u2019m a lazy idiot, despite knowing that I have mental health issues.A lot of the things have been more minor, too. Putting mail on the table instead of the mail basket he bought for us.Putting either too many or too little dishes in the dishwasher. (I still don\u2019t know which I am guilty of, he\u2019s said I do both all the time)Accidentally nudging the little handle on the bathtub once.Idk, maybe I am really a shitty person to live around and be with, but i feel like I\u2019ve put more effort in the last year than I was before, with having real jobs and paying bills and such, but it\u2019s still a daily struggle to even exist, and I just want to not wake up to someone berating me in all caps.","132":"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years. My mom and I often take a journey (5 AM in the morning) by train of 3 hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. The doctor fixes the day for us to visit him. It causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in India. Not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line (in the hospital) just to see the psychiatrist. My mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. Instead she does it herself. You won't believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy (maybe because it's a famous hospital around here). When I visited him, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti-depressant named, BUPOZEN 150mg tablets. I have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for 3 years. My parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. They aren't even aware that this tablet is a anti-depressant. The doctor never tells us about it. Just expects us to believe him and take the doses daily. I never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.All these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it  after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them? Many times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.I even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist.  Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24\/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you  don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.Now coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them. I think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants? I'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds. I'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? What do you guys think I should do?","133":"Hey guys I am in 18 year old Indian who suffer from depression social anxiety ADHD (I don't know I have ADHD or not but I definitely have lack of concentration) got beaten by poverty I am also a college student and doing really shit job to for 8 hours to earn rs 300 (4$ maybe) per day support my family because my father dies when I was 5 year old and now you are thinking I am a boy with severe depression no friends (forget about girlfriends I suffer from anxiety even I stand near the girls) Never got good marks in school and now you will advice me to meet psychiatrist. But in India if you go to a psychiatrist people will call you idiot mad retarded and you know I am extremely sensitive to rejection due to all this shit in my life I decided to do a suicide but can't do that because my mother made a lot of sacrifices for me if I will die who will take care of them. But I can't tolerate depression and then I ask doctor Google to solve my problem initially I got really confused because there is lot of antidepressant but in end I decided to take fluoxetine modafinil and atomoxetine for my shit brain. In India you can get medication without prescription except drugs with abuse risk. just go and tell pharmacist you are in emergency.thats an only upside of living here. in the next morning I decided to take fluoxetine 60 mg modafinil 200 mg and atomoxetine 60 mg.

This seems to spiral out of control despite things on paper looking good.  I'm a male in mid 40's, have a wife, two teenage kids, steady and well above average paying job with a lot of freedom to set my own hours, routines and focus areas. I'm healthy and fit, not good looking but not ugly either, have a few long-time friends that I actively communicate with electronically and every few months we get together to hit the bars and shoot the shit. I live in a nice spacious house, have very manageable mortgage and leftover money for travel and stuff.Sounds great, right? Then why do I feel like shit and that this is a pointless struggle of a life that has seen it's apex and this decaying body and mind on it's way towards the inevitable nothingness. That I guess could sounds like an average middle age crisis that ppl I fix by buying a motorcycle or whatnot. I might just as well find my fix by killing myself to be done with the dark thoughts and existential crisis that seem to just get worse by the year.Don't take this as a suicide watch thingy, we're not there yet. But for the first time in my life last night I started evaluating that as one potential solution. I'm a long way from it as I feel a lot of responsibility not to cause misery for my family but since things escalated like this I thought it's time to do something which triggered me to write here.I'm a long time reddit lurker but never had an account until now. Guess that's kinda selfish to only contribute when in need of a community that might be going through similar thoughts. I could talk to my SO and friends about this but I don't want to be a drag. And once I voice out such deep shit there is no taking it back and I'm afraid of getting branded as that \"sad and depressed\" guy. Have shared some thoughts with my SO but as this kind of shit is not something she can relate to I don't want to get her concerned. And I do know my friends go through some deep shit every now and then, but prefer to keep our interaction as something fun instead of it turning into suicide \/ depression hotline.Thinking about the potential reasons that might drive this decline towards the abyss I have self-analyzed a few potential reasons and characteristics that might play a part:I am quite an introvert and the older I get the more social anxiety I seem to experience. I can do just fine in a social setting with colleagues and such and I think I could even be considered funny and good company. But that's a role I play that consumes a lot of energy and I would rather just mope out of the way. I seem to also have a tendency to over-analyze the perception others have of me and how my behavior and verbal output affects it. This makes interactions a chore I need to pay attention to and has kept me totally out of social media as it's all about keeping appearances.Secondly I drink and smoke weed on recurring basis. Have done so more or less since my mid 20's. I try to keep to weekends for the most part, but then I do get toasted (while keeping it under control in a sense that I'm still presentable in front of the family). I think this might have had a detrimental effect on my mental health and reinforce my social anxiety, but it's hard to quantify as this shit is not an exact science. But at the same time this combo has brought me such an amount of pure joy and the absence of the depression and existential crisis haunting in the background. And the thought of stopping it gives an outlook of a life so bland that might just not be worth living.Thirdly I'm a 'fake'. I have always found it hard to share what I 'truly feel or think' which probably comes from over-analyzing of others perception I mentioned earlier. I actually am not sure myself what I truly feel, think or want at this point. I'm not sure who the fuck I actually am. It's just noise of million things bouncing in my head. Have done some meditation to overcome this and get pretty decent experiences out of it, but for some reason I struggle to persist on that. I have used bunch psychedelics and MDMA back in my 20's and with that the fundamental self reflections, reconstruction and feelings of universal love are quite familiar. This seem to make meditation pretty easy with some help from waking up app and such. But still it's hard to stick to it. Maybe I'm afraid of discovering things I don't want to and finding myself in a cave somewhere in India with just a cane and rags on my back.Surprised if some one made it this far through this wall of text and what I to easily tend to characterize as a big man whining and first world problems. And interestingly enough it seems that suicide rates of well-of countries go up with age while in developed countries the trend is the other way around.Would be great to find people to reflect thoughts on this. Perhaps in this thread but also through private messages.Even as I am about to submit this I wonder what will people think.. LOL.. sad.","136":"hi sir\/madam please help me , I am 18 years old male from India.

I have been feeling too much stress and pressure from my work because of unrealistic quotas and overtimes. This Job pays above average and I can't get this kind of pay anywhere right now and I cannot continue working my current Job due to the stress. This has put me into depression, anxiety and I'm feeling no emotions at all lately. Moreover my family's (Me, My brother and my Mom) financial burden is on me, although I have an elder brother who works just as hard doesn't really get paid enough, so 80% of my family's finances are dependent on me. If I quit this Job or switch, we won't be able to pay our bills and debts. I'm in a trap and don't know how to get out, I don't know if I have a question, I'm just venting it out. There's literally no work life balance, My work is basically between life and death :( And I have my own personal problems to top it off.These days I just wanna give up and just do nothing for few days. But I can't afford it. I'm trapped!","138":"Hello everyone of this community. Been a long time lurker, first time poster.I would like to start by saying that I feel like I've been depressed for the last 5 years or so. Currently 20, hitting 21 in May. Honestly speaking, I don't even imagine reaching the year 2020. I'm not suicidal, just to let everyone know, though like almost everyone on Earth, I have had lots of suicidal thoughts. I have been just going through life on autopilot for the last few years, so anticipating the mere concept of a future has been far from my most recent thoughts.I feel so emotionally numb and yet also feel like I might break down crying every waking moment. Sleep, video games and junk food have been my drugs of choice for the past few years, so as you can imagine, I am not physically in great shape. Sorry to be going off on such a huge tangent, but I would like to give some background information about me.I live with my parents in the USA for about one year now. We immigrated from a third world country close to India. Grew up in an extremely religious Muslim background, though I am an atheist now as of 2 years ago. My parents do not know this, and to keep the peace, I go along with their requests regarding religion for the most part. Both of them have M.Sc in Psychology and yet do not understand the concept of depression properly. I have tried talking to them quite a few times about my current condition, but all they do is compare my upbringing to those of people in worse countries. Since coming here, most of my time is divided between going to classes and work, so I have had no time for social activities. Also, the social activities people partake in all over the US is forbidden in Islam, so essentially I am completely alienated from these kinds of activities. My mother is always worried that American influence will 'corrupt' me, so I have to stay away from most social occasions in general. I have no one to talk to, and no one to describe my state to. This subreddit is the closest thing I have ever had to bring able to relate my experiences. All of you people who comment on these posts to support people, I salute you. To me personally though, not trying to offend anyone here, it feels kind of patronising. What I am trying to say is that I am emotionally vacant and bordering on the side of insanity, though I do not take that lightly. I know I am in a great place of living, living a life far better than a lot of people around the world, and so it always feels like my problems are no big deal compared to other people.I have self-sabataged so much that it is not even funny. I am a huge failure in life, social, physically, mentally, academically as well as in being a good son. My parents work their asses off so that I can lead a good life, and yet all that goes through my head are my stupid small problems. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Everytime I get motivated to be better, it is almost always immediately followed by a surge of demotivation from my mother's comments. I wanna be a good son and human being who is able to help people, and not an emotional b***h who can't do anything but whine. But, I just wanna be held in someone's arms and be told that it is ok to cry my heart out and that my problems are not dumb or miniscule. I think we all want that. Thank you to anyone for listening to my rant.","139":"Hi, I'm a 25 y\/o guy from India.For the last 5-ish years now, I've suspected that I might be depressed. I am doing okay for the most part. I don't have any suicidal or self-harm thoughts. The thing I am most stressed about is the loss of control over my life. I feel like every so often, I spiral into a really bad place. It becomes really hard to get out of bed and do basically anything. Sometimes I stay in that bad place for weeks feeling helpless. And there's a voice inside my head that I've kind of... trained (??) to yell at me things like, \"GET UP!\", \"JUST GET OUT OF BED FOR ONCE!\", \"TAKE A BATH AND IT WILL BE 100% BETTER I SWEAR\", \"PLEASE JUST TAKE ANY ACTION... ANYTHING! BRUSH YOUR TEETH! RIGHT NOW!\"But even that has stopped working for the most part. I feel an immense loss of control over my actions and habits. I think I might be addicted to passive content consumption, porn and masturbation as well. Sometimes I set rules for myself like, \"I'll watch Netflix only on Sundays\" or \"I'll sleep by 11pm at all costs and wake up before 7am\", but after a while, I slip up and fail at those too. And there's a lot of such failures. I don't even know whether it's depression or something else. But whatever it is, it's affecting every sphere of my life. My health, my work, my social life, my self-confidence, everything.When things are going well for me and I'm in a good place mentally, I try to take screenshots in my mind and save the good moments. I keep hoping they will help me when the next bad phase hits, but they seldom do.After struggling with this for so long, I'm getting tired and I have no money to see a therapist. No idea how to deal with this. Please help.","140":"I gave everything for an exam. I didn't take any job after graduation, I decide to prepare and take a exam through which you can get job in some  government of India regulated sector . I gave everything. I changed my number. I left my friends. Studied 10hour+ everyday. Didn't party, didn't go out any day. Everything was going great and somehow I got nervous in the exam. Flunked it.Now I feel no will to live. I constantly think about suicide. I really don't wanna do it, I know I can do better. Fortunately my parents are very supporting, they didn't get angry but I can feel their disappointment , and they should be disappointed after all. This failure reminded of every failure I had in life. I took many exams, for University entraces, for jobs, and managed to flunk each one of them. I always regarded myself as good in studies, I  was one of the school toppers. I scored one of the highest marks in whole india in 10th grade. All my other topper friends are going well in life and here I am jobless. I didn't go to school reunion because I couldn't look them in the eye. I have good social skills, started one of the most active public speaking community, literally had thousands of contacts in my phone. Then I decided to focus on this exam and killed the community myself. Changed number. And here I am , flunked it.I am not jealous of anyone's success. I am just disappointed with myself. I wish I was never good in studies , I had never scored good in 10th grade, I would have never even thought of preparing for such exams and might have been doing some nice regular job. I wish I could just wake up from this sad dream. I feel like crying, screaming.","141":"my name is af. Don't wanna disclose everything. I want to tell you a small story. I live in India. I study in India. I left my home country xxxxx Arxxx after completing high school. Then I joined computer science engineering. I love engineering. I love computers. Usually, I am a very outgoing kinda guy. you know the extrovert in the group. it was august 2019 when my 2nd year engineering results came in. I failed. I was detained for 1 year. and all my friends were gonna go away, I don't come from a very rich background. The higher middle class, my dad works in xxxx.  We live paycheck to paycheck. But I was happy. My mom is an angel of a woman. I love her more than anything in the world, I also have a little sister which I love. My family had gone through a lot of depression. anyways, We tried to live happily.  got admitted into a good college, Failed.  I was broken, I didn't sleep for months, I applied for re-evaluation for the papers. I used to look into the eyes of my mom. And used to cry every day, I never slept with peace. I was going to college but was just hanging around the cafe, I never went to class, people we were demotivating me, There were some of my friends who tried to help. But all things used to go apart everything. I was gonna have my mom's dream broken, I have to earn money. I have to keep her happy.  October 19, 2019, my results came in I passed!  I was crying and laughing at the same time. you know that scene from ford v Ferrari when henry ford 2nd cries and laughs at the same time when he sits in the ford gt. I wasn't talking to anyone for hours I was not stopping I was crying and laughing. My mom and sis cried with me they didn't even know why I was crying. when I told she broke. she hugged me. told me why I didn't tell her. I said I didn't want to disappoint her. I love you mom, I love you, sis and dad. this semester I had an idea of a product for a hackathon(competition) statewide. I and my team worked hard. and we won. Now I am working with Microsoft and state traffic control, participating in a nationwide competition. My mom was proud of me.  I am not an engineering kinda guy. I love solving stuff. I love building stuff.  You know what I am joking. I love engineering. I hate my board of education. rant aside. My motive was to help my fellow people of planet earth. Don't feel alone, Pain is temporary. never give up.","142":"Hi, Its my first time posting here and prolly the last timeI been going to depression since the last 7 years when my dad died due to heart problems. I tried many ways to get help, talked to my parents, my school counselor (I am 16), talked to my friends but its of no help.4 years ago I moved to the US from India. Naturally people think that indians are smarter than americans but I am the complete opposite, I averaged around 60-70 percent on my grades which was really bad for my family. I thought it was ok since I am at-least passing my classes but this semester I have failed 3\/4 classes because of anxiety and stress. I tried explaining this to my mom but she thinks its an excuse and everyone thinks I am a failure. I dont know what to do with my life no more, I am going to end it all, I cant take this shit no more. I am sorry mom, I love you and I am going to miss you","143":"Met the girl of my life 3,5 years ago. She's from another country and in that culture men don't show weakness and talk about feelings. This girl is not like the vast majority of women there (because she simply doesn't like these old gender roles) and even said to me early that she love that I am a guy who can show emotions, cry if I have to and not as most guys who try to be macho. But of course her being raised in this culture, even though she doesn't like this cut off emotions\/play tough attitude that's how she's borned and raised.I have been suffering from recurring depressions since I was young (now almost 40). Tried all kinds of medications and therapy but nothing has really helped. My previous girlfriend wanted me to talk about how I feel so I'm used to that, but still doing it on this level I've done I will never ever do if I fall into depression again. A problem is that the depressions has led me into severe self hate, and I read out old conversations and it was painful to see how pathetic I acted. Even the smallest things I reacted to like the world was going under. I told her how my life sucks, how I am bad in this and that way. Really stupid and the last thing you should tell your girlfriend, especially early in the relationship.She had never experienced depression and because she had a tough childhood in a poor country I can really understand how pathetic this must have looked. Anyway, my dream is a house on the countryside and I had the chance of my life with this girl. She wanted to move with me to a house and I found a dream house for a very good price. But my fear and doubts made me hesitate and when I finally made a bid it was too late. She later changed her mind and wanted to stay in the city were we live but later I got a second chance because she was up for it again. But I was too picky with house after missing out the dream house and she got fed up with this.Things went worse and worse, I got on sick leave by the time she moved to me. She is super social and positive and this is exactly the kind of girl I want, and especially her. But my negativity, criticism and judgemental behavour made her move further and further away from me. I was never bad to her but depression can get you self absorbed so I overlook her needs and didn't do the things I should. I am a very kind and caring person otherwize (many even say that I'm too kind), but again the depression made me self centered. I only visited her home country once, I didn't help her out that much as I should with learning my language and other things. She didn't know people (obviously) when she moved here and even though we did a lot of things like travel, partying, creative things etc I understand she was feeling alone. Now she has a circle of friends through her job.She did bad things too, like going behind my back, ignoring\/rejecting me a lot. She's not a talker and I think she suffers from some problems herself (she can cut off her emotions completely, she has a huge fear of abandonment etc). It was very hard to talk about issues because she basically always saw it as me \"fighting\" even though I was calm and just tried to solve things. She had trouble with understanding why I didn't want to join on all these parties - because when I did I was always social. She called me insecure for not wanting to join and that made me feel insecure and it came to a point when I isolated myself, even at work.Otherwize I am actually a confident as a person. I have mental strength from coping with depressions for so long but overworking just made me fall into the rabbit whole before I could see it coming and stop it. Before I was suffering from severe OCD but I beat it myself with mindfulness and exposure. I am not scared of exposure and always want to improve myself and get better and better.8 months I got diagnosed with ADD which was the reason for depressions and anxiety all the time - hence no other medication worked. I have become better and better - more and more social. But it was too late. A lot of trust issues led to this led to that. And she broke up 2 days before Christmas after me talking her into trying again 3 times during 1,5 month when she said it was no idea because it won't work. We're fine now but it's hard to see her date guys while we still are living under the same roof (only for one more week though).But, she told me that if I only got that house all had been different. If I only had proposed to her. If I only this and that. I was angry at her for some time because how cold hearted she acted post breakup but when I read our old conversations I understand how difficult it must have been for her. And reading her messages when SHE was the one that really pushed us into buying that house (which today I regret I didn't do and can't help but continue dwelling) is painful. I won't do it again but cannot forgive myself that I did it. That I lost the chance of my life to be with this amazing, loving and worry free girl.Also before the breakup I booked an appointment for couple therapy. I hoped that she could get perspective and see her faults too, and see that we actually could fix this. Unfortunately the session was very unfair. It was mostly about my depression and it all made it sound like we were so different persons and she believed it so much that she told me after coming out from the building: \"Thank you for taking me here. Now I know I made the right decision!\". And she wasn't angry at me or anything, she just said it because she was happy to \"finally understand it.\" She even told her workmates this and I hate that I took her there because again it was unfair. I am not the person I used to be, I have changed to much and continue to do so day by day even though it's hard as hell all this.And the thing is when I am not depressed (and now after I got the right medication) we are a super great couple. We are like soul mates and we said it before. And now I am even more a person that fits even better with her than before, but I know she only thinks of the bad times because it makes it easier for her to move on. Fuck, it's hard. I even remember her telling me that she told her mom when meeting me that \"this is the man I am going to marry\". And that night we kissed and continued to say \"I love you, I love you\" to each other the whole night while looking in each other's eyes. It's so hard to think about this, it's true pain.I have changed a lot and she told me that too. Since I got the medication for ADD I haven't been depressed a single second and no pathetic things like how I hate myself, how I suck, how I have no friends (shit, can't believe I sad\/wrote this). I have become more worry free thanks to her but there are still a lot to work on and I will become the best I can be. I will go on a trip to India for a month now to expose myself for my fears and become even more worry free (trust me, it's not because I want her back - I want to become more like that for myself). The thing is that she's into law of attraction, meditation, yoga and so on. I have been into meditation and mindfulness a lot before and like these things and will now try to dive even deeper into it. But it' hard with this trip because being honest. The reason I first decided to do it is to prove to her that I am independent and can follow through something like this, not just being something I say I will do. And the reason I choose India was partly also because it's her dream country and I wanted to impress her I think (being in love make you do crazy stuff).aI know the probabilities that we get back together is low even though we said only a couple of days ago that we will see later on. She said that maybe we can start dating again in the future and in that case just skip the past and start all over. But I can't stop dwelling the past, how I lost this chance. How I could be so stupid, scared of change. How I couldn't see what I had.How do I forgive myself for loosing this one in a million girl? How to I stop dwelling? I really need help.Thank you &lt;3","144":"Just spent a month in India. I went initially for a friend's wedding and decided to stay for a bit. I learned a lot there.

I have no courage to see my result, as always. Not even once since I came to this college, my result has not left me broken from inside. I spend days, weeks and months every time the result releases, to accept it and try to analyse my mistake and motivate myself to do better next time. Because I can still make up for it. But can I?For the semester 4 exams, I was determined to do my best. I decided that this is going to be my final attempt in trying to do well in exams. Because this time I was performing to win. I was even enjoying the subjects. But what did I get? only passing marks. I was left shattered, broken and wanted to give everything up and live the rest of my life in anonymity. But giving up on anything is never an option. I wish it could be. But we always have to finish if we have decided to do something. So I still had to face the next exams. I was under depression by then. It's been over 2 months. And I still am. I  tried to get better. But I can't. Because I can't get rid of the root. A  part of thinks that I am giving an excuse to myself, just to get a  break in life. But the rest of me knows the reason. I haven't been able to achieve anything in these five semesters. I consider myself a loser. I  have wasted lakhs of my parent's money. I don't want to tell them this because I don't want them to react by pitying me or because they care about my mental health. I can get better only when I can make them proud at least once.It's not that I don't like what I'm doing. I love it.  But the exam pressure doesn't let me enjoy. It evaluates me on how much  I can recall and on how big answers can I write within the given time constraint. I want to ask India, \"Is this the right way to judge a  future engineer? By seeing how much they can reproduce under pressure?\".","148":"&amp;#x200B;**You:** wait**Stranger:** ???**You:** im in depression**Stranger:** oh why**You:** dont say anything**You:** just let me vent**You:** if you have the timw**Stranger:** go ahead**You:** jee mains is like the make or break exam in india**You:** either you get a rank anf go to a really good college**You:** or you fuck up and enter a viscious cycle**You:** bad college**You:** bad job**You:** and an entirely fuckall**You:** life**You:** and ive made a glorious entrance into the latter**You:** now.**You:** im 17**You:** i literally ahve one friend in school**You:** my class has all the studious people of my school**You:** i try my best to talk to them**You:** they NEVER respond**You:** so**You:** i have to study well to be worthy for them**You:** but i need friends to keep focus**You:** im totally fucked**You:** it wasnt always like this**You:** till grade 8. i had really good friends**You:** i was quite intelligent and smart for my age.**You:** i had interest in astronomy and all the other geeeky shit.**You:** highly advanced for my age**You:** i really dont know what happend**You:** since them ny grades have deteriorated**You:** my friends changed schools**You:** and my parents being the orthodox south indians,**You:** made me focus on getting my grades fixed**You:** no dont get me wrong**You:** my parents are the nicest bunch of people ever**You:** they were always supportive**You:** they tried their bbest to provide everything i needed and most of what i wanted**You:** but i subconsiously feel that ive letthem down completely**You:** thats all**Stranger:** oh thats long**You:** thanks a lot for listening**Stranger:** well its the same here in singapore**Stranger:** i hope you feel better**Stranger:** :)  cheers**Stranger has disconnected.**&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**ps- thanks a lot to the person on the other end for listening. i never got your name but i pray for your well being, health and happiness. bless you**","149":"Hey, I'm an 18 year old boy from India...

I am now 38 years old and 1 year ago after mental breakdown due to stress they finally took my case seriously. I've tried all medications in the book; SSRI\/SNRI\/TCA etc. Nothing really helped, and these depressive episodes has really fucked up my life in so many ways.Friends that got tired of me, missing out on stuff and broken relationships. The last one broke up with me 3 weeks ago after 3 years. We had a LDR for 1,5 years before she sold here apartment in her home country and moved to me. She is the opposite and has no problem of letting go, making decisions, dealing with possible bad outcomes from them. She is a genuine happy and positive person.We had a sessions today with a couple therapist and everthing was so clear. The reason for the relationship with this wonderful lovely woman broke apart because of my damn depressions. I hate them and they made me loose this gem. After finding out that it was actually ADD I suffered from I got ADD medication (amphetamines) and since then life has changed a lot. It took me maybe 6 months to really adapt, but my now ex girlfriends positive mindset and this medication has changed me to become so much better.However the depressions has shaped me in many ways, and even if I'm not depressed anymore the mindset of the depressed me is still there. The dwellings, the doubts, the fears, the \"what if's\". It was so obvious today at the meeting and especially after. I can't stop blaming myself for letting this happen. My dream is a house on the country side and I even bought a house but changed my mind in the last second, lost 15.000$. I should just have gotten that damn house and I would have lived there now with this wonderful girl.I hate who I was and even if I'm not the same person I can't help feeling pathetic because I was like that. Afraid of everything. And I need to be able to let go. Let go of what has been and start moving forward without looking back. I HAVE to stop the dwellings, they are haunting me. I close my eyes and see this house and us living there, every fucking day. I dream about it and I can't distract me from it. It's was the same with my ex girlfriend, in that case not have the guts to get kids with her. Now, I am happy that didn't happen because we were not a good couple. But that's also the thing, it took me 4 years (out of 10 years together) to finally realize we were not a good couple. Even so I dwelled afterwards for such a long time.I get stuck in my fantasy world and even if the medication helps it doesn't help enough. Nor do therapy or anything else. I have tried mindfulness and it helped me with anxiety, but not with this. And I am serious now, if this won't stop I will kill myself sooner or later.I will leave now for a solo trip to India. I wanted to show my ex that I am capable of making spontanous desicions and be an independent guy (travel alone). India is the country she's always wanted to go to and I think that's one of the reasons I choose that. Now I feel terrible due to the breakup and I really don't wanna go, but I will do it. 4 weeks from now and be away for a month.But I need to change, fundamentally. I have a potential that is masked by all these emotions and fantasies that won't stop. Please, any advice whatever it may be and I will listen.Blessings.","152":"The other day my partner and I wanted to watch the Irishman at home and we started it a little late in the evening. I started watching enthusiastically but got distracted midway with a battle with mosquitoes that were waging a war (yup, urban Hyderabad, India) and I didn't catch some parts in the movie. We only got through half as it got quite late with food orders (we'd not had dinner and he was hungry), eating. He doesn't like watching movies with interruptions. He told me if he had known I was going to be so disinterested, he'd have watched it alone.How's it like watching movies on depression? I've been diagnosed with severe depression. Anyone have such experiences where you're not fully into it even though you want to be?Edit: Added the 'he was hungry' bit.","153":"I'm from India and I've tried all kind of anti-depressants and none of them helped me.

Its a quote by Mahatma Ghandi of India, a beautiful nation with a rich culture (though I've never been)   I'm curios if anyone here has done anything that would be considered weird\/against the norms of society \/not advised for the reason they felt it was the right thing to do and if so how it turned out.

So sorry if anyone feels disgusted at my language.Iam an Indian, we have an examination called JEE Mains, every student who has finished his 12th class (engineering), must write it. Being an Asian my parents had high hopes on me, because society here is entirely different. People value you by your marks, literally everyone asks about your rank.So let me just tell you about JEE MAINS real quick : Over 1.2 Million people write it every year. You can get into prestigious college's through these examinations. The people who get below 10,000 ranks can opt for which ever course they want in any college (National Level). (And yes it's a highly competitive exam). The people who get above 89 percentile of the average score, can be qualified to the next level. It's JEE ADVANCED, about 250,000 people qualify for this exam, and people who get a rank below 5000 in this exam can go to the top most colleges in India.There are 75 questions, in which 60 questions contain negative marking (meaning if you choose a wrong option, your final score will be reduced), and the other 15 questions are integer based. The answer can range from [-99.99 to +99.99].   I have this exam in 10 days from now. Many people prepare for this exam from their 6th grade. (trust me they go through hell everyday) So when they reach this stage they are a little bit different from every one.These ranks define what you are \"in India\".  Nothing else, society here is soo interested in their neighbours kids ranks because now they can laugh at us. You either get a good rank or you spoil your life. That's it. My mom and dad, pay money for my studies, and I feel like I'm not doing justice to them.I know that all my relatives will laugh at me, they discuss about how bad Iam in their homes (100% real). It's like reducing your parents self-esteem, to literal zero.Iam upto no good in this competition, and I feel like I can't do it. (2 years of information in 10 days is not possible). I don't want people saying \"you can still do it stay positive\". Let me tell you it's not possible. No no. I'm just asking for help because I feel like I might kill my self for this stuff.Yes, many students commit suicide for not getting ranks, about 12 people from every state, every year commit suicide due to this exam.Please help meIam not accusing my country, but Iam just reflecting my thoughts on Indian Education System.  That's why I always wanted to live in foreign countries, because atleast there society will appreciate my presence.","156":"I am 18 and I get the same feeling everyday for past 2 years.

I had an older friend, she stopped talking to me because I called her when I was suicidal.I'm the bad guy. I went to these people with my depression and with my suicide... And with my *TWISTED* mind... And I just hurt them. They became hollow. Not overall, but for me as in, in front of me, they became hollow.I killed them. And they killed me.And everyone says I blame needlessly.And I just feel like I'm crazy like Arthur in Joker. I feel like I'm him... Waiting before my show, with a gun in hand, joking about suicide.But I mean it. I do wanna die. I am unhinged. But at the same time, I know I want to live.I know if I had a friend, a real life friend, I'd share so much... But my sharing is not welcome. My mom says... People don't like to hear bad things.And I keep thinking that she's wrong, that people are not so cruel... But, these days, I'm on the last thread.And no, I'm not in need of suicide watch... I want to live. I want to be happy.But I have no one. I need someone to be happy. I need friends. I need support groups. I need support.My psychiatrist does not keep my medical history private... Or I'm paranoid. My psychologist says I should just hide &amp; bury my sexuality till I move to another country. My parents just say the same line \"just be happy\" over and over.My friends are either too scared of me... Or they are so... Dried up... Because of me.I don't have new friends.India does not have \"AA\" type of meetings... Or I would go. In my city, depression is a taboo. Suicide is a hush hush word.I'm alone. I'm a noticeable person where if they find out \"u\/abcdef32 is suicidal AGAIN\" they'll gossip the hell out of it.My ex taunts me. She embarrasses me and shames me. My ears are red just typing this.And if she reads this now, she'll say \"you're always complaining, BE HAPPY\".And I can't be happy. I can't complain apparently. Reddit... Any social media... Is too anxiety inducing for me. I can't find MEDICAL help... I called a suicide helpline for my country, just to see if it could help... And it actually made things worse. I lost the only friend I had made. And my ex keeps playing with my heart.And I just don't know what to do.I want to cut, I want to drink floor cleaner, I want to go to the 10th floor and jump... But if I live through the night, I'll regret it all. Rinse and repeat each night.I want to find a support group but I'm genuinely sure that you can't have those in Gujarat.I'm actually alone.And I don't know how to express my sadness. I don't know how to let it out except by getting angry at myself.And I just want to hit myself, punch and slap.I don't know why I'm so fragile... Somehow I'm broken and cellotaped and broken again.Help me. Give me ideas... Ideas to take out... Express... Show.. Whatever... My sadness.","158":"I\u2019m 19. I have no interests.

I was 10 back then. I had no friends, and the fact that everything was so different didn't help. A couple of people befriended me along the way. I hardly stepped out at all, and being socially awkward, I never made good friends or approached anyone. Heck, the first time I actually had a proper conversation with a girl was when I reached high school. I was clinging on to my only friend at the time, not realising how toxic he was. A few years passed. In grade 11(I was 16) of school, I changed my stream and got shifted into a class with all girls, with just a handful other boys except me.It was the first time I stepped out of my comfort zone, and made a handful of close friends, most of which were girls. Two years have passed since, and it's almost the end of my school life. A lot happened in these two years. I lost all motivation and had breakdowns every night. My grades fell to the lowest, and I failed in every test. My parents were worried sick. I had friends but I never talked. Only listened.I don't know why I wrote all that,sorry.I feel empty and down every day and always make these scenarios in my head where I try to gain attention by taking drastic measures. I just want people to know how I'm feeling, but now in doubting my own thoughts. Am I making myself sad and secluded just for attention? It seems that all I want is a friend to comfort and hug me as I weep.It's almost 3:00am now and I have an exam tomorrow, for which I haven't studied one bit.I know I have lost all drive, but I think that I dumped myself here just so that people notice me. But no one has noticed me yet. Sorry for the rant, I'll probably delete this post as soon as I feel better. I would love it if someone would comment.(Ah why does it seem like I'm just trying to get attention again?)","163":" Hi,I am an introvert. I live in south India, where extroversion is valued and introversion is treated almost as mental illness. This is actually not a big problem for me, I can fake extroversion and just blend in to some extent. But lately I have been feeling depressed\/sad, this gets worse after attending family functions or events where there are lot of people I know around, interestingly it is not a problem at all if I am around people I don't know at all. I guess I am kinda comparing ,measuring up myself with the rest. I am the kinda person who thinks and advocates to not compare with others, because it gets you nowhere. It's easy to think and be like that for a day or two or maybe a month, but I guess, in the longer run, it is hard to actually implement it. The biggest problem is that I find that I am very different from the world around me, not just because of introversion, but a lot of other reasons too. I like a simple life(i am not being dramatic :), I really do and prefer it that way), just a home, food, clothes and whatever little pleasure I like. But the world around me is not so and as I interact with it (especially people I know), for longer durations, I kind of get depressed\/sad, I guess it is because - as you become an adult (I am male 29 now), you would be expected to meet some expectations (i.e getting married, leading a better lifestyle etc.. ), these are the kind of expectations I am not interested in, I would even take off the whole day next to get back to my normal self.\u00a0**Are there people like me? or am I just the weird\/abnormal one?** (I would be happy to know that I am not alone in this). Do you think distancing myself from others is a good idea, not like - going to the desert\/woods and living away from society, or completely cutting off from family\/relatives, but maybe like relocating to a different country. I don't really like to do that, but if this is a problem of life time, then I guess it is a viable option. And I don't want to change myself, I am proud of way I am(I really am). I am scared about future(how it is going to turn out), life before adulthood is a lot easier. Thank you.\u00a0","164":"tl-dr; I have lost all motivation and intent in life.

I\u2019m kinda undecided with what I want to major in, so I just am finishing up some general Ed classes. This past 2 years have been absolutely hell mentally. I\u2019ve been sad, and I keep on getting sadder and sadder every single month. My senior year of highschool, I made so many mistakes that made me a chill and made me extremely insecure. When I was applying to college, I was too afraid of even living with a roommate, cause I was riddled with anxiety and I feared living with a bad roommate. So I decided to live with my sister in her apartment. I was expecting for my first semester to be extremely fun, and I would figure out what I wanted to do, but that didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve been more alone than I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life, my anxiety and depression has gone through the roof, and it continues to get worse everyday. I\u2019ve joined clubs and went to some events on campus, but I feel worse every single time I go to them. I regret not stepping out of my comfort zone and dorm, because I could\u2019ve met a bunch of people. Every time I come to my sisters apartment after classes, I feel so depressed. I feel terrible and alone every time I come back here, and I don\u2019t know what to do. Even when my sister comes back I don\u2019t feel better. I\u2019ve tried new skills to get my motivation up, but nothing is working. All my friends are having a great time at their university, and I just want to as well. I also started catching feelings for this girl I used to see back in highschool, and now I feel even worse. Everyday I wake up with chest pains, dreading going to school every single day. Finals week is coming up, and immediately afterwards I\u2019m going to India, and for some reason I\u2019m not even excited to do that. I was looking forward to next semester, but I\u2019m so lost I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019ll be good or just as bad as this semester. I\u2019m constantly worried about the future and I hate it, I just wanna enjoy and live life and I cannot do it, it\u2019s driving me insane.I keep blaming myself because I could\u2019ve made this semester better, and I wanna move past this regret but I keep thinking about it every time. My passions don\u2019t even make me happy, and I feel so lost and sad I don\u2019t think I can carry on anymore. I feel like I\u2019m trapped in this apartment for the rest of my college years, and I really don\u2019t want too. I\u2019d tell my parents I\u2019d like to move on campus, but it\u2019s just too much Money. I have enough to do it for one semester tho, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it.I know it\u2019s best to tell yourself it\u2019ll get better, but for some reason nothing has been getting better. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be able to do this. I never thought about actually killing myself, but the thought of dying doesn\u2019t scare me. I don\u2019t think I have a purpose anymore.I\u2019ve been going to the gym every now and then, but I can\u2019t even eat anymore, and I\u2019m slowly losing motivation to attend the gym. I also wanted to start talking to the girl I like, but I don\u2019t know if I can, and if I do, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll lead to anything.I\u2019ve been stressing about my future so much and I don\u2019t want too. I want to just relax and enjoy life, but I cannot even do it for one minute, I always feel like I\u2019m not doing enough. It\u2019s driving me insane.I\u2019ve been through these moments before, but I don\u2019t think I can carry on anymore, thus has been the worst point in my life.If anyone has some advice, please give it to me, I want to enjoy life again and I want to have a purpose.","166":"I literally don't know, where did I go wrong in my life.

So, it all started when I was in school in 9th grade and here in India parents wants their children to become doctors or engineers, if it were a middle class family. I was good in maths, so started studying for JEE (Entrance Exam for Engineering in India), but I was not that good. Made it through the examination but my marks and rank were not that good because you see I was kind of distracted in heart. Always chasing the one who never did love me back. After passing through exam. I got a college but it was not good enough. I made friends whom I live very much. I must say, I have group of 18 friends. Although none of them are my best friend. Meanwhile, my relationship with school friends starts breaking apart. Now it's like they don't even remember me. I have tried very much in the beginning but it all fall apart. And now when I need a job. I'm not at all capable of getting one. I apply in job posting online on LinkedIn, their websites but nothing works. Besides this, now I feel like I'm worthless and I'm the only one left in the crowd to get a job. It's stressful. And wait I did not tell you guys one more thing. After I passed the exams, that girl and I started dating but it ended after 2 years because it was long distance and eventually admiration fades with distance. If it was love then it would not have faded. Those were the exact words. \"I don't know but it feels like the love that I used to have for you....just faded with time.\" And then I just started playing 10-11 hours a day to fill the void she created.So this was me, last 5 years of my life.

I have been bullied when I was a child. So, didn't make a lot of friends. I was bullied because I had crush on a guy and to him I looked ugly (I had acne at that time). So, I got threats such as 'I will pour acid on your face. Nevermind, your face already looks like that', 'I will beat you up with my friends near the school gate.' I could not tell at my home because if I did, I would get punished for having crush on a guy. An orthodox Hindu family living in South of India. My mother did not allow me to play outside either. As a result, on my 17th birthday, I had only one girl wishing me. I wanted to become an actress when I was in my 8th grade. My parents found that out and beat me up. Seriously, they did raise both my sisters beating them up too. I recognized their lack of love towards us. They think that spending money on our education and sending us to schools was love. I could never share anything with them. I could never see friends in them. I became very sensitive. I took anything anyone said that was not an insult also as an insult. I developed sleep issues. I went to do master's at one of the IIT's, India's pemier school. At that time, my parents were apparently cheated by my dad's parents. My dad had worked hard for them and is the main reason they are well off financially. They made him sign off his portion of the property to his brother. Just as I was finishing my bachelor's in a useless school and started master's in a premier league school, she kept feeding these thoughts in me about how they are bad, kept on repeating. At that time, I had problems with my advisor and this tied with that lead me to a suicide attempt. After the first week, she would bring up the suicide every once in a while and made my life a living hell. Somehow, I managed with everything and finished my Master's. I got admission to a good shool and an ivy league school in the US. My parents refused to send me until I got married. They even hit me. By that time, I was already in a relationship with a guy from IIT. So, I refused to marry. I said I would leave with the help of my friends even if they don't send me. Eventually, they yielded because they were scared of their image in the society (mainly my extended family). I went to US. My boyfriend stayed in India. I had problems with my advisor again. Then, problems started with my boyfriend We had already slept together by then. He said he didn't want to be with me because I was whining about my advisor all the time. I was at a point in my life where I could not make friends, I seemed to be running into problems with my bosses andy relationship was failing. After begging with him, he reconciled. I visited India in the December of that year. He treated me so well. Again, after returning, I was having problems with my advisor. My boyfriend's mom would call me and make plans about cleaning her house if I were married. This led to fights between me and him. He went to his ex. I got to know about it. I asked him to repay some money he borrowed from me and then move on. His dad picked the call and verbally abused me. Unable to bear these, I told my parents. I took a break and came to India for six months. I was depressed. My parents taunted me everyday saying my depression was self-made. That I chose to be in a relationship etc. They didn't know that I went physical with him at that point. My boyfriend reconciled again. After my leave of absence, both of us went to US (even he got an admission in my school). This time, the wounds we're deep. I couldn't let go. I used to bring up the past. I even said that he would have slept with his mother. He finally hit me, physically abused me. I locked myself in the bathroom. He threatened something and made me come out and he hit me so much. He apologized to me a lot the next day. After a few months, it became hitting me became a regular thing. He would choke my neck etc. Then, I started hitting him. He was talking to his ex again and I asked him to be honest and to split decently if he wants her. He didn't leave the house. He didn't let me leave the house. He would be gone outside for hours with his phone to talk to his ex who was still in India. I got really mad. Once I got drunk and told him that he would go to jail for hitting me and I started hitting him. He recorded it. After that, he hit me black and blue, poured cold water on me, pushed me, didn't let me leave the house. I left the house when he was not watching. I didn't take my specs (can't see without them), no keys, no purse, no phone. He followed me to the nearby park and called cops. The cops initially said they would take him but because I still had so much feelings for him, I somehow, changed things and made them take me instead. My biggest mistake. He did bail me out and all that. He paid the lawyer fees too. Anyway, the hell I was living in only got worse. I forced him to leave the house after that. He would come to my house everyday, used my spare key. I asked him many times to not come and to return my key. He then would call ally friends. After a few months of going through such  events and severe depression, eventually I decided to leave US and he left too. We are from the same city. I still had feelings for him. Up until we returned to India, he said we would get married. As soon as he came here, he dumped, didn't take my calls and everything. Apparently, he was lying about getting married because he was scared I would turn him to cops. I attempted suicide. As he said he didn't want to have anything to do with me. My parents were forcing me to get married and they were calling guys home. I kept telling them that I had a problem. They asked me to think of them as their friends and tell them things. After the suicide attempt, my life became a hell again. Tauntinge of having slept with my ex everyday, spoiling their name in the society, etc. After a few months, my ex reconciled after a lot of begging and everything. The reason I beg him is I don't want to marry another Indian or date another as they take 'not being a virgin' seriously. I didn't want to make the rest of my life a hellhole. A known devil is better than an unknown angel. Even while I was in the US, I tried to move on with an American. However, I remember my dad calling me a prostitute in the past when I had told him that if my relationship with my ex didn't work out, I would find another guy. Currently, I like my job but I don't have good reviews at work. I like what I am doing. I got a chance to go back to US to finish my PhD which I dropped amidst all this chaos and also due to lack of interest in the subject matter. I am torn between whether I should stay in India in a job that I like doing or go back to US and run away from my parents and my ex. I wish to go on dates in the US and get over my ex. Honestly, I want someone who would love me. I don't know if a stranger would accept me and love me. Relationships start with both people being in a good state of mind. I don't really know what to do. I feel like I am going to kill myself in about a month or so. My boyfriend said he would be better off with me being dead. My parents said that it's up to me if I wanted to commit suicide. They said they would lose respect amongst their family members if I died. But, they said it's up to me. What should I do? Should I run away and do a PhD I don't like and find someone who might love me or should I stay in this hellhole and work at a job that I like while having no one to love me?","170":"I feel like I am spiralling down a black hole. It feels like I am trapped. I can't breathe, my heart is beating against my chest. Like it's thumping really fast out of it and I can't breathe. I haven't experienced pain like it before. It feels like a heart attack. I have felt depressed before after being abused.When I went for treatment in hospital, I was sleeping, I was under the care of a doctor who hailed from India. Nice man to begin with. I was sleeping when he pulled the curtain around ng bed, and put his finger into my butt hole. It was painful and humiliating. I woke up and questioned him. He said that he didn't and it must be the hallucinations from the fever. I could feel pain and  quite frankly I couldn't poop for a few days. So I know I didn't imagine it.Every time I am granted permission for medical purposes I get fear and back out. The memory of this doctor replays in my mind and I just bail. I'm extremely depressed because my church is not really helping. They have assigned me a Councillor but they tell me that depression is a weakness from the devil. I don't understand. I am really beginning to feel like death will be a welcome for me.","171":"22,Male, India. 2019 was the worst year of my life, not sure if things can get worse. This year I lost a very close family member to a long illness and then I got confirmed diagnosis of Crohns Disease and got started on steroids for a while which brought on a storm of its own, fast forward to 4 months later, my days became a constant battle of one kind or another with my condition, also while fighting recurring urinary infections for months, After much pain and many different hospital beds got diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder and irreversible damage to the bladder wall, as I was dealing with that, doctors accidentally found somehow I had only 6% kidney function for my left kidney also irreversible, right is okay( for now) and requires serious painstaking changes in medications and lifestyle to keep the right kidney healthy. Thus, begins the most screwed up period of my life, because of everything that happened I had to give up on two dream job offers because I was in a hospital bed on the day I was supposed to start(yes, both times). Couldn\u2019t give exams required for higher studies because 10 days before they started I broke my wrist.All of this has culminated in a very fragile mental state where I am having breakdowns every week, total loss of energy or motivation, not eating enough, bouts of insomnia or excessive sleeping for days,spending most of my time in bed and still losing weight, sudden bursts of anger, uncontrollable leg shaking and all the stuff that comes along with all of that, having very negative thoughts about my life in general and wondering is it even worth it at this point, and to what extent am I ready or am I strong enough to get through this, where does it stop? When does it get better, if it ever does?Finally decided to get some professional help,Been through various blogs and forums and mental health websites and confused withIf I should see a psychologist or psychiatrist?Really in need of dire help?Any suggestions or help is appreciated","172":"Little bit of background, I was born abroad (in India) and we moved here after I was legit 4 weeks old. Chill right? America is my home and I honestly don't consider myself any different than anyone who was born here\/ lived here forever.But... recently, on *my official bios for work &amp; Wiki page* (I'm an editor in media\/tv), it *shows my birthplace* and introduces me as **\"Indian-born American\"** and for whatever reason it's making me insecure. I feel more foreign, less American, and feel like people will view me inferiorly for immediately seeing **\"Born: India\"** &amp; not take my work\/art as seriously. I feel like I'll be called out for being an \"immigrant\" or some shit - at the end of the day I don't really identify as an immigrant; maybe it's from a place of insecurity but that's just how I feel. I just wish I was born here, and was seen as 'American as possible' - maybe I'm just insecure about my heritage or see it as *inferior* compared to the American-ness and I'm putting it up on some pedestal. Maybe I see immigrants \/ people from Asia as 'lesser' or something and I'm overcompensating for it? I dunnoAll I know is that it bothers me, and not sure how to process this shit + get over it. I'm just curious what y'all think of if you have words of wisdom to help me out with this stupid identity bullshit. I've always identified as Asian-American or just straight up a normal  American dude - am I hateful\/resentful of my heritage? What can I do to get over thisAppreciate you reading this---**TLDR:** Came to America when I was super super young, didn't care until recently my Wikis\/Bios say \"Born in India\" and it makes me feel insecure \/ less American. I don't *feel* like an \"immigrant\" per say, and I feel like my birthplace makes me viewed as lesser.

I instantly got respect and recognition but the only friend i had was jealous of me now he used to point out tiny things to demean me, but i never minded that but eventually i distanced myself from him.Then for 4 straight years i tried to become as socially accepted as possible but forgot about Carrer..i got some real friends who value and help me whenever needed ..and got love of my life.But during this time i lost grip of reality i used excuses instead of action, making fake incidents playing victim and taking approval from everyone.So now basically here i am depressed with all the bundle of lies with me, having a mindset that i know better not trusting anyone and slowing becoming socially awkward.Day after tomorrow is my test that will determine my life's course it is dream of my mother who sold everything valuable to make me study and my father who is bipolar and on brink of stroke. I just want to be normal be happy be a person of action instead of just dreams and talks. I want to be truthful and accepting reality.I have sucidal thoughts even in happy moments and to me ending my life seems a better option than facing my problems .HELPP.S.

I've tried all the major medicines available for ADHD. None of them worked. Some of them caused terrible side effects. I became depressed after a while and then my psychiatrist made me take antidepressants so that I could concentrate and get through college. They also caused horrible side effects. Idk if all the meds I took fucked up my brain because I'm not able to do anything these days. It feels worse than when I didn't take anything and was unaware of my ADHD. My attention span is like 2 minutes and I have no motivation to even do simple day to day tasks. I just want to be able to finish college with bare minimum grades. If only I could sit and read a few lines from a book and get it in my head.I'm feeling hopeless. How is that not a single medicine helped? I just feel like crying.","175":"I've not been functional for the past few months and I'm struggling to get by each day in college. I have ADHD and depression so concentration has taken a huge hit. My attention span is like 2min max. I'm taking meds but they're not helping much.I'm not even able to read simple stuff on reddit. How can I study? I have exams coming up and I'm going to fail all of them. ALL of them. I'm redoing 4 courses already and way behind a my peers. I might not end up finishing college in 4 years and it makes me feel miserable. I see all these posts about people taking a break from college and continuing a year later but I guess that sorta thing is possible only in western countries. I live in India and I don't think my college will allow it. Even if they do there's no assurance that I will recover during the break. I don't want to study an extra year while my friends graduate.  I'll be alone. I can't afford to pay for another year. I feel like crying. I don't know what to do.","176":"I don't want to burden my parents as they are already under huge financial constraints and at the same time , I feel really miserable months by months , I feel that it is getting too heavy to live and I want to heal myself .

My depression and anxiety has taken a toll on my health, especially digestive health  - binge eating disorder. I have zero confidence left in me. And if this goes on for a longer time, they're definitely gonna get me married (arranged marriage - India). I just don't know how to help myself. My narcissistic father controls all my finances, social life, basically my entire life. I just don't know what to do. I keep on telling myself this just the \"before\" part of your life. The \"after\" is going to be so much better and totally worth the \"before\" part. I'm fooling myself. I'm slowly decaying away. I'm dying. I can't actually take my life because 1) I'm a fucking coward. 2) My mother's entire life would be a waste. So yeah.

And I figure I need a place to talk about things, I've been delaying this post for a long time now.Shit just keeps getting harder. Im in school still, I don't feel like going to school, I don't know what I'm gonna do in my life, I haven't decided what colleges I wanna go to, I just dont know anything.My family sucks. They don't understand anything I say, always keep poking me about things, when they're angry they tell me im a failure and at times, i feel like one too. I don't like talking to anyone. I sit alone in school, alone in my room at home, don't go out cause there's no one to go with and if there was, what would I do, where would I go?I've lost all my friends in the past year. Literally all. None left. No one for me to share things with. There isn't anyone I like romantically. Even if there was I doubt I'd have a chance. Self confidence is all over the place.And the worst part is - I'm not properly diagnosed with depression? Like, all the symptoms add up and I study psychology so at a very small scale I can tell I am depressed but I dont know the extent of it. I can't go and see any therapist cause I dont have money and also cause that would mean me being away from the house and the family can't have that, it's like they wanna keep me locked up.I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. In the past 1-2 months, their frequency and quantity have increased by a ton. I started having them when this year began, then it reduced around June or July and ever since August its been bad again. I see myself dead, hanging in my room or something.Even during normal conversations with my mum or dad, or with a teacher or a classmate, I just zone out in the middle of saying something cause I start wondering what it would be like if I just wasn't here. If I was dead. It's fucked up, everything would be going great, I'd be watching a video or a movie and I'd be laughing all of a sudden I'd stop cause I just don't wanna be in this world anymore.I dont wanna work. I dont wanna study, go to college, have a \"great life\". I didnt ask to be born. I feel like I dont belong with every group of people, in every situation.Is there any help that I can get? It's the first time since I'm explicitly asking for it. I dont need pity or grief, I need help, I know that. Any kind of help is appreciated. Please note that I'm from India, the culture and the system here is a bit different and... yeah. :(","181":"I have depression and get anxiety attacks and cant fucking stop crying. I think I went to a traumatic childhood but I dont know what can be considered normal. Children in India get beat up all the time. Is it okay to get beat up for spelling mistakes? I\u2019m not sure.I have googled the symptoms and they seem to match, but I\u2019m not a doctor. It just sucks. I wish I could be sure that I\u2019m fucked up coz of how my parents treated me. My parents tell me that they\u2019ve sacrificed their lives for me, spent their retirement funds in my education so that I could succeed. They say I\u2019ll always be indebted to them. I dont feel that way though. They are also the people who didnt let me pursue the course that I wanted and refused to pay for it. I hate myself for that. I hate myself for letting them bully me into it and now I\u2019m stuck in a field that I have to keep on working in to pay my student loans and my family coz they have spent their funds on me and have nothing left. I feel so alone. I feel detached from this world. I feel so unloved. I remember being poor and so we would all sleep in the same king sized bed, all 4 of us. And I\u2019d get pushed out and would sleep half on the bed and half of my body falling out. And I would cry silently every night. And all I could think was of getting away. My parents didnt let go of any opportunity to scold me, beat me, show me how dumb and stupid I was, but barely can I remember them encouraging me. The times they did, seem formal and detached at best. I was expected to function normally no matter what. My brother was born autistic and so he was loved. And I loved him too. But when I would tell them that they were partial to him and loved him more they would tell me that I was jealous of an autistic child and that was bad. That I wanted him to be mental. That I wished he stayed crazy. I stopped complaining after that.I had no friends. Nobody in my class would speak to me mostly. When they did, it was to make fun of me, taunt me, or to just annoy me. I really didnt mind that. It didnt affect me. I liked to read a lot and so I would just keep reading the stories in my english book or get something from the library. I surrounded myself with stories. My parents hated each other and my dad seemingly beat me when he was mad at my mom or they had fought. I would get beat up for talking coz he didn\u2019t feel like it. I got beat up for hugging him coz he had come out of the shower and wanted to pray and me touching him had made him \u201cunclean\u201d and so he couldn\u2019t pray.Several times I got beat up for not studying throughout the day. If my father was pissed  and found me without a book in my hand, I was definitely going to get beat up. When I bring it up now, my mom says thats normal and that every child gets beaten. She says that he spent his retirement fund on my education and that even if I pay him back, I\u2019ll be forever indebted to him. It pisses me off that I will always be indebted to him. It feels like he was wrong and they messed me up and so I dont want to owe him anything. Worst of all, I feel all this talk of me being jealous of my brother turned him against me. We used to be so close. Now he barely talks to me. He started beating me up too a couple of years ago until I moved out. I have always thought that all of this was the reason for my depression. But what if its not? What if I am actually a horrible and self involved person that small things that my parents did for my good, I concocted as negative in my head and am making them evil? I am just not ready to get a verdict from a therapist. Coz I know I am too unhinged. I cant be right when the entire world hates on me right? I mean I dont get along with most of the people, dont like to talk to many, and have speakable friends that I can count on one hand. I feel that I have just made a huge issue out of this in my head and if thats true, what the fuck do I do?","182":"It's stared when I was 15.Like I got depression because of school (and had anxiety) then after 2years of locking myself at home, and just avoided seeing therapist (cause I felt like a victim or I was too young).

I see so many people everywhere and I cannot help but imagine them in nice, comfortable lives with atleast one person in their lives whom they can turn to. I know this is a bullshit thought. Millions of people in this cursed country are living way worse lives, but I can't help feeling alone about it all.I sometimes wonder if it's the presence of a girlfriend or any relationship in my life that would make me feel more attached to something in life.

But I need to say this.I've been stalling and stalling and stalling the fact that I need to accept this. I'll never ever be truly happy. Because I don't want to be. The only thing I've ever wanted is to be the best. Which I most certainly will never be at anything because I can feel nothing but frustration and dissatisfaction and disappointment because I'm not already the best at it, irrespective of what it is or how long or how many times I've tried it. This movie, \"Good Will Hunting\" has this dialogue that I'm paraphrasing, I don't try anything because I'm scared I'll be disappointed, that's why I don't try anything. I'm afraid people will leave me and that's why I leave them first. Though I know most people aren't rude enough to just outright ghost me, I do know the sort of person I am. A narcissistic piece of shit. Don't get me wrong, but I know for a fact that I'll never ever actually make friends ever because I just lie and lie and lie. Believe me, I've tried to  not lie. Really tried. But I believe my own lies so yeah. I wouldn't know when I did lie. Or maybe I'm lying to myself right now too. Doesn't matter. What I do know is   I'll always be alone and it's me who's decided that. I don't know what I want. What I do know is that I just can't try anything. Right now, I've dropped a semester on top of not appearing for my last semester's examinations and flunking even after cheating through the semester's before. I don't mean to boast, but I am not stupid. I am studying ,or supposed to be studying engineering in one of India's premier institutions of engineering, and I know for a fact that at the very least I'm in the top half of the IQ pool in the college. But as I said. Not the best and hence I've just never tried. Sometimes I just wish I would have just chosen to join a local college, that way, I'd at least have a bubble in which I was the 'smartest'.Before you ask, no I'm not particularly interested in engineering I just chose it because I was relatively good at it and it was also what I was suggested. And no, I don't enjoy anything. All I do need\/want is to be the best. For fucks sake, I can't even play an offline PC game without cheats or a competitive one without getting more and more upset every minute I play. But as I'm at home doing nothing, I need to do something to not want to continually bang my head on the wall, so I just do it. Day in day out getting more and more numb to the prospect of living everyday. I just wish I had the guts to do all that I want to do to myself.","187":"If you're going to read this, please read all of it, because there's no TLDR in the end. And I'd really appreciate it.I wanna let it all out and be honest for once, with random strangers on the internet as my audience.This is gonna be long post, you don't have to read it if you aren't fond of \"oh woe is me\" threads, like no one is.You'll see why I put this on the depression subreddit, just please have enough patience to read all of it.It's been around three years since I actually studied. I don't know when it started, when I completely fell off the hook, and stopped understanding anything that went on at my tuitions, which were, for an examination known as JEE, being an Indian student from the lower middle class, I started preparing for it officially since 9th grade, which is, the start of middle school. Unofficially, I've been preparing for it my whole life, without knowing I was doing so, and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed doing so. My father, a college professor brought me up free of any \"distractions\" like television and movies, lest I fall off the path and become like the other kids were. I read a lot, in the absence of any other form of entertainment, played on my 3DS, which was a birthday present, which I'd get for a few weeks after my annual examinations and then it'd be confiscated, following which I'd steal it back and play on it all day. Being brought up in a household where every hobby could be monetised and be used to benefit my career, where I'd solve textbooks that were two grades above of me, just to get attention from my father, which is yet an unresolved complex for me, why I'd do all of that willingly only to be thrashed if he caught me with my 3DS or with a comic book behind the textbook I was supposed to be doing. He'd enroll me in courses, I'd excel at them, I'd get rewarded, and I'd be punished if I didn't perform. Upon developing an interest in music, he enrolled me in an academy, and when I scored 80\/100 in the initial grade examinations by the trinity board, failing to achieve distinction, he made me clean the car and wash the dishes because that's all I was fit for, in conclusion to those grades. It was just the way it was. Amongst all this, I won awards for debating, quizzing and being actually good at it. I was, an edge above everyone, a peg above all of my peers whom I'd see as dumb and shallow for wasting their lives on going to birthday parties and trying to solve simple linear equations, knowing deep down that I wanted to be a part of it, I wanted to have friends, I wanted to be invited. All this time, I'd whore for attention, I'd be the class clown, I'd fight for no reason just so people would notice me and they did, and not in a good way. All this carried on, after which I dropped out of a public school at the behest of my father and joined what they call an open school, where I'd only give the examinations and for the rest of the time, I'd go for coaching and tuitions. My grades started slipping towards the end of 10th grade, it wasn't as if I was slowing down, I still knew more than anyone around me but I couldn't study for some reason, I'd just play on my stolen 3ds all day, and attempt to write a novel on wattpad. I genuinely craved for a childhood friend, which I still do, someone who's been with me through thick and thin, someone who'd call me up and ask me how things were but that was something that my father didn't allow, guys from class calling at home to talk about anything except studies. He still gives me shit about how my then-friends didn't talk about anything academic on the way to the mall, where he took me for my 14th birthday. I dropped out of a school where I had to attend among other kids and thought, \"oh well, I have all the time in the world now, I can finally start studying and get into what, IIT Delhi!\"Forward to two years and a few months and I'm at the bottom of everything, I failed to score on every single avenue I was presented, the boards, JEE, grade 5 piano, everywhere.This journey, which I'm retracing as I write this, went from me not understanding shit in class, to me bunking classes to smoke or just fuck around for five hours and then telling myself at night that I'd study tomorrow and make up for it. So I didn't understand shit in my coaching classes, big deal, not a lot of people did, this was a peg above the standard board examinations too. But that was all I had, and to my misfortune, I was in the top batch which I secured through my former prodigal self, to whom my school teachers would say that I'll definitely get into IIT, or even MIT, and I wish I hadn't believed them, cause believing that I could sail through without knowing the syllabus or even the name of the chapter that was coming in the monthly test the coaching would hold was a huge mistake, obviously. I wasn't getting shit as to what went on in that classroom, that premier batch of the best coaching institute of that city where a lot of kids, like me, had dropped out of normal school. I couldn't study at home, I don't know why, just found it difficult to look at the book without feeling sleepy or just being out of it in general, and I'd waste 23 hours of my 24 hour day doing nothing, sleeping, listening to music, trying to look good, but hey, I didn't go to school, who was looking anyway? As it should've been, I just rolled downhill, carrying my grades with me, realising that I wasn't that smart after all, there were 40 other kids like me in that 50 student batch, but they were studying and they were scoring, I wasn't, I was pretending to understand and act smart so I could live up to my previous reputation as a fucking prodigy which I slowly realised, I wasn't. I wasn't anything of that sort, I was on my way to be one of those kids I used to laugh at, who would find regular curriculum difficult, which I'd breeze through. This carried on, 11th grade passed, I started dating someone from my batch, cheating my way through every test they held so my father won't turn my life upside down, for which I needed to remain in the top batch, where the founders of the coaching taugfht. 12th grade started, I was still where I started, at 0, with an year left, and the teachers would say that it was enough to score well, if you studied for 10-12 hours a day, but hey, I wasn't studying for 10 minutes! Every night, I'd think that I'd study the next day, fix everything, and go where I wanted to, which was, IIT, and even that dream escalated downwards, from the best, to the second best, to the third best, and finally, any above average engineering college because fuck, I was nothing, nada, I had no idea what they taught me in those two years, and it was all gonna come in that dreaded examination, which was, in January 2019. In August 2018, I made a post on Reddit asking for help in studying, asking for someone who would sit me down and make me study with them, and the most sane advice I received was to throw my phone away, which is, again, stolen from confiscation, cause hell, I wasn't allowed a small Nokia, lest I talk to me friends when I'm supposed to be studying. To throw my phone away and spend every waking hour studying, which I didn't do. I'd still watch movies all day, sleep, or cry because I wasn't studying and everyone was and my future was in flames. All the while, I was dating her, and I must say that her presence was extremely needed, she studied all day, talked to me at night, made time for me since like me, she didn't have school either and helped me study. Not wanting to disappoint her like I was disappointing everyone around me, I'd lie to her about how I was studying and how everything was good, and it carried on. I didn't know when and why, the pressure of seeing my future burning down before my eyes got too much and I started to cut. I had self harmed before, in 9th or 10th grade but this was unlike it, I loved the feeling of making cuts on my thighs with a box cutter and feeling my wounds burning as blood dripped down. Once, trying to explain why I found it so hard to study, why I couldn't pay attention to anything study related, I went on Google, and like any self diagnosis, it was errored, pointing me towards ADHD. I told my mom, she asked her brother who's a child specialist at some private hospital, who said that if I had ADHD, the symptoms would've shown themselves sooner, and not in high school. Some time later, again, I googled the reason as to why I slept so much, when I'd always been a light sleeper, why I never felt happy, why I couldn't focus, and there it was, depression. I didn't give a shit, I dismissed it completely, being surrounded by people on social media who would talk about depression as if it was a statement, and I thought to myself that this wasn't shit and I wasn't supposed to blame my inability on something I don't have, hypochondria is not something that befits a student. I had a friend, he was somehow going through the same, with exactly the same premise as me, we'd hang out, he got me smoking until I couldn't stop, we'd talk about how shitty everything was late into the night, he'd cut way more than I did, and time passed. He visited a therapist, somehow convincing his parents, came back and showed me a prescription for Toficalm and Bupron, his diagnosis reading \"depression, ADHD symptoms and NSSI\". He studied a little towards the last few months, got into a below average college, and is now out of state. We don't talk anymore, and no one around me, including my then-girlfriend liked his presence.In March or so, I begged my mom to let me see a therapeutic presence so I could ask, or confirm, because I hadn't yet started believing that I was depressed, because as of now, almost everyone I know is supposedly depressed, no one has friends, everyone has a therapist, even 13 and 14 year old girls, I don't believe them, the same way I didn't believe myself either. She took me to see her friend, who, after everything, told me to drop the whole engineering dream. I told her I didn't want to, she told me that I didn't want it. When everything was over, in May, my father sat down in front of me and cried about how seeing me fail hurts him too, as much as it hurt me. Obviously, in the absence of my passable grades, I was offered two choices, to drop an year, and reattempt the next, in 2020, or to pursue English honours in his college, under the Ward Quota, which still isn't an option, which never was, even though her friend encouraged me to take it and go out there and enjoy. I willingly accepted the drop, seeing it as a chance to turn things around and fulfil my IIT dream, and join my then-girlfriend where I wanted to go, IIT, where she went, with all her insane dedication towards studying and being successful. This was, in May, my birthday month, the lowest point I've had, with the absence of friends, surrounded by the people I disappointed, with no one to call me except relatives, who'd ask me how I scored. My father's friends, who had seen him bring me up, strongly disapproving all along, convinced him to take me to a counsellor, or a therapist. It happened, I told her about me cutting, smoking, and everything bad in my life, and how I still wanted to study and do engineering. She, from there, recommended us to jointly see her and a psychiatrist, because, as per her, after 8 sessions, I was, clinically depressed. My father refused, firmly believing in a no drug approach, yelling at me as to why I can't talk to him about it, why I couldn't just study, why highschool was such a big fucking deal. This carried on until my mom begged me to stop destroying the family, because supposedly my father felt betrayed and hurt due to my inability to open up to him or spend time with him, or even be alone in a room with him for five minutes, and he was taking it out on her and my sister, while I'd stay in my room all day, sleeping or watching Bojack or some other show. The psychiatry never happened, the counsellor told my parents about my cutting since I was 6 days away from being 18, technically being 17 and posing a danger to myself. They cried outside the hospital, made me promise that I'll never cut again while my therapist told me to start off small, by studying thirty minutes a day, she made my dad enroll me in a couple tuitions, where I'd be forced to study and so he did. I still didn't study, I lied to her about doing so, and she admitted that I can't be put on any kind of medication due to my father being firmly against that. After this was over, she told us that our next appointment was in two weeks, which never happened, because the first question that my father asked me when I asked to go was why I still needed it, why I still couldn't talk to him about about whatever problem I was facing, and again, why highschool is so difficult. Once or twice, he'd bring up my self harm, telling me that it's the sign of a weak man, following which I'd go to my room and let my anger out by sleeping, which I did after every stressful situation, sleep it off, smoke, repeat. Things got better with time, I stopped cutting, I started to understand what went on in the classroom, filled with the same kids I looked down upon a few years ago, who struggled with the same curriculum as I did. I still couldn't study at home, unless it was homework, and I couldn't stop smoking, though I lessened it significantly. What still ate me up, and still does was the fact that I wasn't self studying. Even an hour a day. I'm no longer anywhere near intelligent like I was, I'm slow and dumb, I can't make do without self studying. I'm cheating on the weekly tests they hold, I'm failing at the test series my father has made me join for JEE, thankfully, due to which he has accepted that it's way out of my league and he shouldn't expect results over on that avenue. Anyway, June-August, this carried on, I wasn't really happy, as, again, time was running out and still is but at least I wasn't in that phase, the cutting-smoking-repeating-never feeling happy tirade. Come September, the pressure builts in with about three months to go, during which I need, need to study and finish the stack of unopened textbooks lying in front of me. I need, to stop cheating, I need, to start, fucking, studying. And then she breaks up with me, citing the absence of time to talk, because even though we were in the same city, it was more of a long distance relationship as I wasn't allowed to go out for anything except my tuitions. My one and a half year, stable and happy relationship, ended, because it wasn't fulfilling. She couldn't find time to call me for days on end, being in one of the best colleges in India and studying and excelling, while trying to live the life she missed out on in highschool, with proms and parties rightfully taking priority over me, leading to fights and guilt and eventually, her telling me that she's not in the headspace for a relationship, with no time to date.I'm scared, I'm scared that this will all end up as a repeat of the last year, I'm scared sick that I'll fall back into that phase and yet, yet I can't study. Yet, I'm lying in bed all day, calling her up, with her screaming at me to move on and let her do so too, to get on with my life and study, instead of throwing it all away. Eventually, I convinced her to let this be a break for the relationship and not a complete end, because God knows I can't let her go, the shitty fucking person that I am, I don't want her to move on, I want her to stay. But I know that she'll leave soon enough, as we're still fighting like we did, about how she could spend 5 hours at a party but how an hour is a lot for her, when it comes to calling me, because I'm just there on a screen. I understand how selfish I'm being, how much guilt I'm putting her through with her thinking that I'm not studying because of this, but I couldn't study before and I can't study now and I don't know what to do. The relationship is beyond saving, with her developing into something she never was once college started, acquiring anger issues and a tendency to be a prick and tell me that she's sorry later, after she's told me to stop acting like a kid and study for fucks sake, and get on with my life. She doesn't know that I wasn't studying while she was there, and I can't tell her that either, like I couldn't tell my therapist. The relationship is over and I'd love to move on but hey, she had friends who took her out the day she broke up with me, I don't have a single person who texts me first. The ones I've talked to, about the break-up have told me to move on, which I know is what I should do, but again, I can't. I'm slipping back, I purchased a new box cutter, like the one I used to cut my thighs with, I can feel my day just being wasted, I can't cry, I just can't, I can just be a sad piece of shit and watch the sun rise and fall and I watch Netflix and live on a diet of unhealthy proprietary food, with Instagram and Reddit sprinkled in between amidst me running my hand over my thigh, feeling the marks I made some time back. There's a well of guilt in me, eating me up, for all the sacrifices my parents have made for me, and how I've done nothing but disappoint them, which I shall do again, in a few months. And yet, yet, I can't study, I can't pick myself up and sit at my desk and try to study without getting distracted, and then doing anything, anything, except studying. I miss her so much it hurts, I can't let her go, I'm just wasting my life doing nothing, not even being happy about anything. I'm just this sedentary sad piece of shit who sits in bed all day and holds his head in his hands at night, not knowing what to think, missing his ex girlfriend, not wanting to admit that his happiness did indeed rest on her presence. I can feel myself going back here, and I don't want to. I don't wanna fail again, I can't fail again. I need to move on from her, and I need to do something about my life, and I need to be happy as I do it. When she was sad, she'd study furiously, she'd engage herself in productivity, slowly not feeling my absence and then being fine a few days later, surrounded by friends. I wanna be like her, I wanna study 15 hours a day, and I don't wanna be sad and most of all, I don't wanna slip back into that hell. I've already cut on my thigh with a blunt pair of scissors, I don't know if I'm depressed, but I'm acting just like I was then, and the sadness has increased exponentially with her leaving. It's dumb, it's so fucking dumb, I'm 18, it was just a teen relationship that didn't carry through and yet it's breaking me, but who am I kidding, I wasn't studying before her, now that she's not here anymore, I'm becoming more and more depressed, like a normal person does after a break up, coupled with loneliness, guilt, and the crippling knowledge that I'm going nowhere and that I serve on purpose to anyone, even myself.I don't wanna start cutting again like I used toI don't wanna smoke everyday I don't wanna be sad all the time I don't wanna waste my life like this, at a crucial point like this, my last chance at a good engineering collegeI'm tired and I don't wanna kill myself, which sounds like a great option, but I know I can't do that.Please help, tell me what I should do, anything, to just get out of this and move on and do something with my pathetic existence.","188":"To be better than before And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019mSucceeding. It is super difficult thinking I\u2019ll never find a romantic partner that fits, that I won\u2019t be financially stable ever, and I won\u2019t ever have kids. Being part of a family business and helped it grow to a size we didn\u2019t think we would before hand. Raised hundreds of thousands for educating underprivileged kids in India. Lead teams of volunteers. And I\u2019m right now considering transitioning careers and it is just super difficult to think about the future in any hopeful way. My parents are getting older. My little sister is going to grad school. And I feel so guilty and horrible that I haven\u2019t done more. Feel like a complete loser. And nothing will ever get better. And maybe folks would be better off not having to worry about me? I don\u2019t know maybe mourning might be better than worrying. I know that doesn\u2019t make sense - it just feels super difficult to think it\u2019s not too late for me to change. It\u2019s a brick wall of a thought I keep hitting.","189":"CW: depression, sexual violence    The past is currently affecting my mental health. I feel so useless and pointless and don't know where to go with my life anymore.When my father started showing signs of dementia, I was a junior in high school. The reality of the situation didn\u2019t hit me until freshman year in college. At the same time, my grandfather in India was ill, and my mother spent most of her time outside the country. In terms of paying tuition, I was set. When it came to living expenses and emotional support, I had no one.I didn\u2019t think it was physically possible for the human body to shut down. I didn\u2019t know that a human was capable of crying for hours without calming down. I was surprised that I could lie in bed for hours, wide awake, without having any will to move.After conversations with my therapist at the time, I speculated that my growing isolation was my fault. I didn\u2019t reach out to people. I decided to change that. I reached out to acquaintances, people I just met, everyone. Many of them took advantage of my emotional vulnerability. And one night, someone took advantage of me physically. My school was under Title IX investigation. Our disabilities services was inefficient and unhelpful. Professors and classes were known to give students zeroes on exams, even in the event of an ER visit. I would have no institutional support.In the process, mutual friends either cut me off or refused to stand up for me. All my relationships became strained, as individuals who claimed to support me were suddenly \u201ctoo busy\u201d to help. The one thing folks don\u2019t tell you about sexual violence is that the event itself isn\u2019t the most traumatizing part--it\u2019s the aftermath: the victim-blaming, the shame, everything.I was traumatized for years. I can count on one hand the number of people who stood by me in undergrad. My brain shut down. I skipped classes out of fear that *he* would be there. I avoided libraries out of fear of running into *him* I chose isolated spots just to cry myself to calm. It\u2019s astonishing how much time one can spend in front of a book only to absorb nothing when the mind is repeating a bad memory. I was surprised that I didn\u2019t fail out of school.I couldn\u2019t tell my parents. But when they asked me why I wasn\u2019t applying for medical school straight out of undergrad, I could only open my mouth and say nothing. I could not say that sexual violence had resulted in multiple Cs on my transcript.I said I needed some time. But that\u2019s when I started to fall apart bit by bit. I took pills hoping to go to sleep and never wake up. I shaved so heavily into my skin I drew blood. I sent rants to my friends, pleading for an escape. None of what I did worked. I knew I had to pursue more education if I wished to go to medical school. A master\u2019s degree posed more financial use over a post baccalaureate program. I went to graduate school, got straight As, and applied again.But every single time I applied, every time I was denied an application due to my academic record, every time I was asked why I had academic difficulties only to burst into tears...I remembered that night and what followed. While I can work on healing, medical schools will never forgive me for what happened.  And now, I can't either.","190":"For the past few years I've constantly struggled through anxiety and episodes of depression. Getting through college without dropping out was one of the hardest things I've accomplished. And in the past year, my self-sabotaging behavior has almost shattered my blooming career.I've cried over nothing and everything, isolated myself from basically everyone, I've no friends, I've distanced myself from my social group. I rarely go out. Crippling social anxiety and body dysmorphia has made it impossible for me to go out. Explaining how I feel everyday is difficult. It's dark, spiraling, gloomy and heavy. I want to run away and start afresh. But I've zero self esteem or confidence to materialize it. I know I have some unresolved issues from the past, childhood. Neglect and being a witness to brutal domestic violence takes a toll on you even when you're a grown up.But the most painful fact is that I'm not where I expected to be by this age. Not being able to even give a fight anymore is eating me alive. I can't get myself to start any new projects or finish up old ones, I'm too scared I'm gonna fuck it up again. I'm living my life with the Pause button on. I know I'm not happy. But I haven't been clinically diagnosed with depression yet. Mental health is still a taboo topic here, in India. This retired \"psychiatrist\" whom I visited with my father the other day - without any having learned any history of his patient - bluntly said I'm \"not mentally ill, just running away from responsibilities\" and that I should \"learn to control my five senses\". Well, he also told my father that he didn't have OCD, when my father has been under treatment for the same for almost two decades now. I know the \"doc\" didn't know what he was talking about. But I'm still scared as hell because what if I'm playing tricks on myself and may be I'm just lazy and a procrastinator and not sincere towards my goals? What if these mental health issues are just excuse to get out of getting the job done? A small voice in my head has always whispered \"you're faking it\". And this incident has volumed it up.I know I should consult a good therapist but they are hard to find in this part of the country. Till I find myself a therapists, can someone please help me sort my thoughts out before my brain explodes?","191":"I am a 30 year old male and I am trying to put one foot in front of the other each day.

I was preparing for government job exam(thats what we do here in India) and wasn't able to focus on her for a month.she blocked me from everywhere and now I started to crave for her I tried to contact her but she won't listen to me. I was so depressed and it became part of my life I stalked her from different account everyfuckenday and keep going on with my life 27x7 depressed.I also noticed  sad posts on her profile then somehow I found that there is no other guy,  after 9 months (december 2018) she messeged me and we started talking again as a friend (I started to feel great).on Fifth day I told her I still have feelings for her and boom I was blocked again.Everything fell apart. It was like I came back 9 months in a time machine. Again same feelings same depression and anxiety.I joined gym in January and keep going on with my life, slowly depression became sadness and stalking was there too.In February 2019 her best friend J added me on Instagram and we started talking day &amp; night, but I convinced her that her friend was wrong in this and she has mental tortured me.In May V unblocked me and wished me happy birthday, this time I blocked her I don't know why (I was not over her tho).On a good day june 29th 2019 I messaged her and we started to talk and we met same day as she was in my area.  It was not good as those glorious times but I was glad that we are friends. meanwhile I sometimes talk with her friend J too, she asked me how is it going betweet me and V and me, I told her that she don't talk with me that much and is there another guy, she told me there isn't. On August 5th It was V's birthday and my first day at college for masters we met and had a good time and in the evening when I reached home she messaged what was I asking to J. I said \"didn't she tell you what was I asking her\"?and boom I was blocked again. I checked insta facebook, phonecall was blocked too. J SHOWED MY MESSAGES TO V. I was not able to sleep so I sent 1 SMS \"just talk to me for a minute\" and emailed her that you forgot to block me here.At 2 am she unblocked me and messaged me to talk.I literally begged her to stay and explained her what happens to me when she is not talking to me. I can't go through all this again and again. She said \"so I should talk to you just because you become sad when I don't talk to you. What kind of excuse is this?\" I said don't talk to me just don't block me. That's what happened.She blocked me on whatsapp after some days maybe my DP was hurting her eye.But this last month became really hard for me this time its worse than last 2 times, I'm getting anxiety attacks. I read old chats I'm am not able to delete them coz what if she comes back and everything became like good like it used to be ?Instead of helping me J told me to forget V. My friends also say that. But how do I do that ?its not that easy to forget.I check her profile every hour and I'm definitely failing this semester. also I was not able to crack those goverment job exams,duh.What should I do guys ? I can't explain what I'm going through. Therapists are not common in India even if I get one, sessions will be so expensive that I'll not be able to afford.","193":"I don't know how to talk to my family about how I feel. It's hard enough to understand myself. Ever since I was a kid it's like I've been spectating my own life. Things always seemed to happen around me and I never seem to have any control. I was diagnosed with ADHD but my family didn't really believe in the diagnosis, and so I've never received treatment for it or anything.My parents are from a small village in India, even though I was raised abroad. My schooling was British, but when I got home I lived in a traditional Indian household. My sister assimilated pretty well but I never quite did. My sister was younger so every time my parents made a mistake with me, they could fix it by the time it came to her. Like when I was in Year 2 and our school held a 70s disco for the grade. I told my parents about it and they made me go in a costume from a South Indian 70s movie. I got bullied like crazy for that, because most kids just wore normal clothes. My parents had gotten an arranged marriage when they were young, and they always resented each other since they had nothing in common. My dad expected my mom to act like a regular Indian housewife, and my mom was always bored and lonely since there were no native Indian people living nearby. My dad usually expressed his anger by smashing things, although he never laid a hand on my mother. The bulk of my problems began when I started my GCSE's. It's the exam we do at the end of the Year 11 with the preparation beginning at Year 10. My parent's told me there was an issue with my dad's job and as a result we would be relocating to India at the end of the year. Unfortunately, due to the way the school systems work, I'd be pushed back 2 years. They said the best thing would be for me to do my GCSEs all in 1 year. It was a pretty bad year as I had to work twice as hard and my teachers made comments about me, claiming I was crazy for the attempt. Some made comments to my face, others behind my back.Without their support I lucked out and my grades were great. However, my parents revealed that the job stuff wasn't as big an issue as they had made it seem. And suddenly I was pushed up a grade and in a class with people who were 2 or 3 years older than me (I also started school a year early). My parents even went into school and chose my subjects without my permission. I only found out because a friend sent me a picture asking why my parents had come into school (I was sick and my mom claimed she was going to the doctor). The next 2 years of school was hell, as I was emotionally manipulated by a crush, my teachers treated me like a joke since I was the \"baby\" of the year group and I hated half my subjects. I spent those years arguing with teachers and my parents, and I always felt isolated. I also did terrible in class. I got accepted into medical school and have been here for the past year, but I'm only here because my parents want more than anything for me to become a doctor. I turned 17 a week before I got here. I was not prepared for any part of all this, and I've been severely depressed for the past year. I gained 16 kilograms in the past year, and I spent days on end alone in my dorm. I've been staying in university all summer to make up for all my setbacks this last year. I've tried, but I just hate my classes and I think I'm gonna fail my final exams next week. I'm torn because I hate it here but I also think my parents will make my life even more miserable if I fail. I feel terrible yet I feel no compulsion to study.I apologize for the rant but I've needed an outlet for a few years now. Thanks for reading.","194":"Danny, formely of www.depressionisnotdestiny.com, has compiled a list of suicide hotlines from around the world:Argentina: +5402234930430Australia: 131114Austria: 142; for children and young people, 147Belgium: 106Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina: 080 05 03 05Botswana: 3911270Brazil: 188 for the CVV National AssociationCanada: 1.833.456.4566, 5147234000 (Montreal); 18662773553 (outside Montreal)Croatia: 014833888Denmark: +4570201201Egypt: 7621602Estonia: 3726558088; in Russian 3726555688Finland: 010 195 202France: 0145394000Germany: 08001810771Holland: 09000767Hong Kong: +852 2382 0000Hungary: 116123India: 8888817666Ireland: +4408457909090Italy: 800860022Japan: +810352869090Mexico: 5255102550New Zealand: 0800543354Norway: +4781533300Philippines: 028969191Poland: 5270000Portugal: 21 854 07 40\/8 . 96 898 21 50Russia: 0078202577577Spain: 914590050South Africa: 0514445691Sweden: 46317112400Switzerland: 143United Kingdom: 08457909090USA: 18002738255Veterans' Crisis Line: 1 800 273 8255\/ text 838255","195":"I am 23 years old male from India. A little bit background about myself:1. I never had many friends in my life. I console myself by saying that friendships are temporary,we should rely upon ourselves,but deep inside I long friendship.I had 1-2 friends during my college days but they are all busy now after getting jobs.2. I am fat and unhealthy.When I was 18 years old I picked up the habit of eating junk food,cheesy pizzas whenever I felt depressed. It gave me a feeling of satisfaction and even after so many days I still feel the same.Eating is an hobby to me. I don't have any other addictions like drinking,smoking or playing video games.3.Since I am fat,I don't have any confidence for socializing. I feel that everyone will judge me and will laugh at me after seeing my protruding belly.That is another reason why I am not able to talk with people - irrespective of gender. I become so anxious when I am in public that in my workplace I don't go to canteen for having lunch rather I eat at the desk only.I feel that people will laugh at me if they see me eating.If I hear people chuckling,I think that they are probably laughing at me.I am 172 cm in height and my weight is 190 lbs.In my workplace,no one generally talks with me. I just sit in one corner and see my colleagues making plans.They are so happy while I am suffering. I feel bad that no one even asked me to join with them for lunch.Nor did they invite me for team lunch and outings.I had one girlfriend when I was 17.But she left me after one year when she got into medical schools saying that an engineer and a doctor will never understand each other. ( I am a Comp Science graduate btw).All this things revolves around my head everyday and the situation becomes more grave at night. I even tried to cut myself several times.I feel very bad when I think that I am unworthy of being friends with people.I would like some friends with whom I can have meaningful conversations.But alas! I don't have any. I fear that one day I will be consumed by my loneliness.Is there any way I can survive and end this suffering?","196":"North America\u2019s US is in a constitutional crisis over someone who publicly told Russia to hack emails resulting in his election and is playing Hokey Pokey with...Chinese trade war who in a semi Civil war with Hong Kong.Speaking of trade, Britain is leaving the EU with no plans other than free trade with South Korea.South Korea is having trouble getting along with Japan.

I'm an Indian who lived in Botswana for most of his life. I came to India by myself for a short visit but decided to complete my education here. That was the worst decision of my life. I scored an average grade at the end of school and got into a uni for a B.Tech degree. I fucked that up due to my mistakes and changed colleges halfway. Was going to complete it this year when my college fucked up. They told me I had an exam to clear which they hadn't told me about before even though I confirmed with the exam dept. about which courses I have left to complete. I might have to drop out of the college soon since my time limit is almost over. My parents are decent financially, they funded my brother's entire education (Undergrad and mba) in a foreign country. I do not want to live in India anymore but starting over from start seems bleak as I doubt I will get admission anywhere else outside of India. I really have no idea what to do with my life now. I'm turning 25 next month. If anyone has any advice at all please help.","199":"If you have kids, this might resonate with you a bit more. This a article I wrote to ' Fight the New Drug', an porn awareness organization and I hope you can read it all the way through. Here goes:From age 10-16, my dad came home every single day and watched pornography in his sinister locked room. This was in the early 90's, before the universal prevalence of the internet. I would return home from school and watch my favorite show, Oprah, and every day, he'd rush home before my mom returned from work with that unforgettable VHS shaped paper bag filled with a VHS porno video. My dad in general thinks everyone is stupid except him. Sometimes, he would drive with me to the actual video stores where he would buy the videos while I waited in the car. He was simply in his own world and so ignorant, never thinking how a child could react to such experiences.These years are a humans most critical and formative years neurologically, hormonally and physically. We were an immigrant family, me being the only one born in the US. My sister is 8 years older than me and she had left the house when I was 10. My brother is 5 years older than me and was never home as he was involved in all sorts of leadership activities, eventually becoming a huge entrepreneur. He was always callous and uncaring, especially lately. It all started with my dad.On a normal day, my dad would finish his business and come out of his locked room and want to hug me, but I was totally repulsed by him. I felt he was a scary nasty pervert. Daily, I would sit in the living room armchair feeling frozen and stuck, fully conscious of what he was doing, conjuring up instinctually horrific imagination, and this resulted in me boiling in my own fumes of hatred and contempt towards this man (and the world). I viewed him as a monster, along with his unhinged angry verbal abuse wherein he instigated brutal screaming matches with me and everyone. He would constantly call me retarded, sometimes in public and so loudly and viciously, that people called the police. As I grew up, I tended to refer to him as a psychological terrorist. Everyone in the family endured his temper, but only I endured the psychological destruction of him masturbating in the nearby room to me for 6 years.This had a lot of repercussions, definitely leading up to today.At that time, I didn't speak to anyone about it. I didn't know what to do. I figured no one would care or do anything about it (and I was right, my family knew this was going on). Because I never wanted to ever be in any close proximity, being alone in the car with him was like catatonic anxiety, or go on any family trips, plus I was very cold toward him, I was constantly scolded and resented by everyone. I was deemed an ungrateful brat. It appeared like I was a young teenager with extreme teenage angst and took it out on him. My family were all angry at me. My brother in particular.At age 10, my dad moved into my sisters' room with his giant size desktop, watching the beginning stages of internet porn. I was in the adjacent room and could never sleep, unable to stop thinking about what he was doing and I developed insomnia. For 18 years, I've never slept without sleeping pills.I didn't get my period until I was 16, a cause for concern by any doctor. For the rest of my life, I would get my period about 3-4 times in a year, and that has abundant unhealthy implications. The stress had caused hormonal damage as well.At age 13, I started pulling out my hair (seems like a reasonable response for a girl literally going crazy every day, not knowing what to do, having nowhere to escape to and no one to talk to). As my mom discovered my hair pulling, I explained it to her and she accused me of lying (i.e. that I had really shaved my head). Later, as it became undeniable, her reaction was to call me disgusting. There was no talk about what could have caused this and the idea of getting psychological help was nonexistent. Them being immigrants is not an excuse for ignorance. At the age of 17, I discovered my hair pulling was a condition that had a name... Trichotillomania (TTM) and now I know it is pretty common and it is a kind of self-harm or OCD (similar to cutting or a nervous habit like nail-biting). I\u2019ll have this OCD for the rest of my life. I would clearly choose TTM over depression.I developed depression at the age of 10. As soon as possible, I got a job at 16 so I was able to be out of the house. I made a plan to graduate one year early from high school (by going to night school and summer school) because I was so unhappy, not good at making or keeping friends, anti-social, etc. I wanted to just escape... so I left the country. I saved my money and travelled to India and some other countries for 6 months. No one in my family asked me about university. However, after getting good grades during a year of community college, I was accepted to UC Berkeley and got a degree in cognitive neuroscience. Like a lot of others, I wanted to understand my own mind on a neurological level. After graduating, I moved to Israel alone (another escape from family). But a few years later, they all moved to Israel too.Cut to today, I'm more depressed than ever. My 'leadership' brother is now a CEO of a large company and has refused to use his connections help find me a job for the last 5 years. I believe he still sees me as that 'spoiled brat'. A few years ago, I tried to commit suicide, was in a coma for 2 weeks\u2026..and later, made another attempt to 'escape family' by moving to Italy for 2 years.I confronted my dad around age 27 about his porn addiction once while we were in the car, and because he is so incredibly weird, he responded and said 'empires have fallen and risen over sex.' Whatever that means, it was just a bizarre, sad attempt at an excuse. He and my family think that his porn addiction had no effect on me (or that it shouldn\u2019t have and I should have been stronger) and even when the head of a psych ward said so, they brushed it off as bullshit.I confronted my mom at age 30, asking about what she knew or if she knew (and she did) and tried to explain how it affected my whole life. She simply responded with ' but did he touch you?' From my studies in neuroscience and just from a basic understanding of human development, I know my dad's porn addiction triggered my depression. In my 20's and early 30's, I lived with mild depression but managed it well enough, living a pretty satisfying life. Later, life had hit me with a ton of bricks and it was all downhill from there, where I am suicidal again, my relationship with my family couldn\u2019t be worse and I can barely function. I'm on disability and have social worker(s).My dad has calmed down a lot and has spent significant effort connecting me with all my social benefits for psychological services (to fix what he broke). But there will never be anything as healing as getting the validation from my family that something harmful and, dare I say, abusive was actually done to me by him and I will never get that validation. It is nearly impossible for me to come to terms with that.","200":"9pm sitting at a chicken bbq at the side of the road in india. A very warm and busy part of the city, the air filled with carbon dioxide as I was eating my last peice of rice and chicken, a very malnourished dog comes up to me. his eye missing and tail looks burnt but still wagging and damn guys it has the cutest eyes and i just couldnt say no.so i gave him the chicken and it happily went to its corner and started chowing down.i did not expect this but after a gruelling day in university i felt really happy something i havent felt in quite awhile now just pure happiness that i was able to bring happiness to this dog.thanks for reading","201":"Hey depressos. Wanted to bounce this idea off yall and see what comes back. I\u2019m at a low spot and not sure what next steps to take. Disappearing in another country and never coming back to my home country sounds appealing to me atm. Like India or Thailand or Peru. Im really not sure. I quit my job a few days ago with no replacement lined up. I\u2019m not in love with my field.  I will not be able to realize that salary in my next job because I will not be able to get references from the place I just quit. It also looks like the relationship I\u2019ve been pursuing will not be going anywhere. So I could sell my stuff or put it in storage and just go on a very long vacation and potentially not return. Nothing is right","202":"I don't know why I want to kill myself, I just do. I had a good upbringing. I was born in India to two hardworking parents and they always put food in my plate and made me feel comfortable throughout life. I was excited and happy about life until the beginning of the university. My parents pay a shitload of money for me to be here and I am extremely grateful. But I have wanted to kill myself ever since I almost failed out of school in the first semester. I don't have any reason to hate myself, I just do. Most people that are depressed have real reasons or have a fucked up past. I just don't see the point in living. I am in whatever rabbit hole I am in and I don't know how to get out. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this. I don't go to my classes and gave up on getting good grades. I just make sure I pass my courses because I wouldn't want my parents to be even more disappointed than they already are. I don't have any interests or hobbies. Last year, I tried to cut myself with a razor (stopped almost halfway through) and recently I wanted to kill myself by just spraying a can of pesticide in my mouth but I couldn't do it. Every time I look at a tall building, all I want to do and think of is to jump from it. I have even tried punching glass to break it and jump from the tallest floor in the building but that only gave me a sprained wrist. So yeah, I don't know why I want to kill myself. And I hate the fact that I'm too pussy to just do it. I also hate the fact that I'm the most fragile motherfucker around.&amp;#x200B;So here I am, in the middle of searching for Oxazepam, writing this hoping that I am not the only one who wants to kill myself for no reason.","203":"In having trouble renewing prescriptions here due to a prevalent doctors biases against medication. I have a friend in the USA who has a very similar history and symptoms and her doctor duly renews her prescriptions and in fact advises the exact opposite of what doctors here suggest - Once you find an optimal dose and since your condition is chronic, stick to it plz.Here docs once they find the med is working, they hurry to taper to a lower dose and eventually taper off. I've relapsed twice after tapering and the getting back on my feet has been an ordeal to say the least. They seem unmoved by this fact and it's FRUSTRATING.Can I have a doctor in the US review my case and pass on a valid prescription I can use to procure the medicines I desperately need here at home ?","204":"TL;DR: Travelling can give you a new experience and help with loneliness. It can help you feel more confident and see what truly is beautiful in life. If you're short of money, don't worry. Do your best and if you have the cash to spare travel to a closeby location where you may not have been.I don't know you. I don't how depressed you are and how much you can function. But if you are someone who is financially secure with enough vacation days, consider travelling if you haven't. It's very depressing to wake up with nothing to live for. At least for me, I don't sleep ok or perform at all because I'm completely in a rut. But I don't see life as not worth living for. I've had terrible days where I've wanted to end it all too but while I'm here let me see what treasures life has to offer. For me, travelling is an invigorating experience that makes me forget everything else that crushes me in life. You don't have to go far. You don't need to go halfway across the world. If you're in a huge country like the US, India or Brazil you have plenty of options in your own country. The experience of another culture, cuisine, arts, music and so many other things keep me alive and make me want to hang in there.If you have no friends, don't worry. Travelling alone can be perfectly safe if you do your research.  Another beautiful thing about travel is meeting other people. They don't ask you about your job or anything else that doesn't really matter. You can be completely open to someone who you may or may not meet again. If you're lonely, travelling can really help you by meeting all kinds of unique, beautiful people.Another bonus from this is that you have things to talk about with people after you're back home. You could feel less shy or anxious because you have a story to tell from your experience. If you're someone who's short of money and struggling to make ends meet, it's ok. I am too but I manage to make it work whenever possible. I do it in a very solid budget usually within my state. Whoever you are, best of luck and I hope can find a happy life.","205":"Hi. I am new to Reddit and this is the first subreddit that I joined. I am a 23 y\/o female living in India and I've been here all my life. I'm writing this because this feeling sometimes gets so overwhelming that it is hard to function properly sometimes. The fear of judgement. I have always been a rather submissive woman, obeying my parents, doing things properly and I also have this clinical need to please others. I want everyone to like me. My friends, family, everyone. Sometimes it gets super hard. I have always wanted to do something creative in life. But that was suppressed by my need to please my parents and impress my relatives. I finished school, scored well, got into one of the best colleges in my city and I am currently pursuing my masters in economics which I really really don't want to do. I'm doing this because of how people call me smart because I took this subject. Doing this because of how my dad's face brightens up because of this. But the sad reality is that I just don't fit in. I want to travel, make music, edit videos and make a living out of it. I know that I'm good at it. I've worked with various popular artists in my country but I get credit under a false name because I feel like I'd let my parents know about my double life. I wore a top in a music video that showed a bit of cleavage. My shot was of 2 seconds. The video was viral in my family and everyone was talking shit about me. It fucked up my self esteem real bad. Everyone judged me for my clothes and everyone thought the worst of my character. But the clothes that I wore that's ME. I LIKE DRESSING UP. I like showing skin and it makes me feel confident but it's such a taboo here in India. My family is going on a vacation to Malaysia in 3 days and I'm packing a bikini. I want to get some pics clicked without my parents knowing and I really do want to post them on my Instagram. My account is public because people like my style and my posts and I like the appreciation that I get for my creative posts. But THE FEAR OF BEING JUDGED COMES BACK. what if someone takes a screenshot and sends it to someone from my family? What if people say shit to my parents? What if I don't become the ideal wife for someone because of wearing a bikini on a beach?I'm so so tired of this. My anxiety is through the roof. Why does being true to yourself comes with so many terms and conditions?","206":"I\u2019ve dealt shitty thoughts and general mistrust since I was a teenager I guess from being bullied or whatever it was.  I managed to get through college and was doing pretty good in my career until I decided to move back to my hometown to be closer to family a little over a year ago.  I took a remote position and worked it for a year before I was let go because of the company outsourcing the position to India.So I\u2019ve been living off of my savings for the last four months and yet to find a job.  I\u2019ve been single since I was 24, without even a friends with benefits situation.  I\u2019m turning 29 tomorrow.  I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life alone and feeling like I\u2019ve wasted my prime sexual years you know.  I\u2019ve been pretty numb the last year but I feel like the weight of everything is crushing more recently with the thought of being almost 30.  \/rant I\u2019ll get back to my bourbon now \ud83e\udd43.","207":"Hey y'all, hope you're doing okay or at least just getting byI wanted to share here the extreme emotional distress I experience whenever I am out in public. Especially when I am working in a high public environment like my new (and second) job as an event security guard.I am 19M. Never had a girlfriend or many friends. The one time a girl was interested in me, I blew it up.Whenever I am out, and I see all these beautiful girls, either by themselves or with other people, my heart sinks 50 feet in my chest. I end up feeling hollow and as if a dagger has been stabbed in my chest. The pain is so bad, that I want to put a knife in there myself and end it all. I start thinking about suicide and self-harm and how my relationship situation (either friends or romantic) is completely hopeless.This is one of the few situations which can make me feel so bad that I want to end it all.As a cherry on the top, it doesn't help that I have moved to a new country. Honestly, this is where I wanted to live all my life, it's awesome and I am grateful for it. BUT thinking about my relationships I start to feel alienated. As if no matter how much I wanted to be here and how well suited I think I am for this country compared to my own, I will never truly belong with the people here. Extreme alienation, cuz if I don't belong here, then will I ever belong anywhere? (India to Canada for those wondering)I guess I feel so terrible because I know I have what it takes to be social, to start and maintain relationships. But my depression gets the better of me. I may not be as socially skilled as I would like to be, but I know how to get better. The problem is, getting better involves rejection and failure, and as okay as I am with that fact, depression makes every setback feel like the end.I understand that in time these feelings will pass and hopefully soon I will be able to deal better with them.But for now, it hurts. Hurts too bad. And it always has.Thank you","208":"I turned 30 in October last year.I had gone through a rough breakup, and decided I needed to turn things around:* I lost 50 pounds and gained a lot of muscle.

Early mornings, on your feet for hours in rounds, doctors chewing you out in front of the entire ward if you can't answer a question, practical exams, having to study when you get home in the evening but still leaving enough time to sleep to prepare for more of the same the next day.I failed a rotation so I'm on break until the next opportunity to redo it comes around. The break started out okay. I got to catch up on sleep and pick up things I always wanted to try like programming and graphic art but these days my brain just can't stop hyperanalyzing my situation.

Mainly directed towards those dealing with depression that somewhat concerns our shitty societal system, not being able to see a future, and hell-bent attitudes against change...I know this looks long, but I found it so fascinating I ate it right up\"In the middle of the 1970s, a group of Canadian government officials chose 1 \u2014apparently at random\u2014a small town called Dauphin in the rural province of Manitoba. It was, they knew, nothing special to look at. The nearest city, Winnipeg, was a four-hour drive away. It lay in the middle of the prairies, and most of the people living there were farmers growing a crop called canola. Its seventeen thousand people worked as hard as they could, but they were still struggling. When the canola crop was good, everyone did well\u2014the local car dealership sold cars, and the bar sold booze. When the canola crop was bad, everyone suffered.And then one day the people of Dauphin were told they had been chosen to be part of an experiment, due to a bold decision by the country\u2019s Liberal government. For a long time, Canadians had been wondering if the welfare state they had been developing, in fits and starts over the years, was too clunky and inefficient and didn\u2019t cover enough people. The point of a welfare state is to establish a safety net below which nobody should ever be allowed to fall: a baseline of security that would prevent people from becoming poor and prevent anxiety. But it turned out there was still a lot of poverty, and a lot of insecurity, in Canada. Something wasn\u2019t working. So somebody had what seemed like an almost stupidly simple idea. Up to now, the welfare state had worked by trying to plug gaps\u2014by catching the people who fell below a certain level and nudging them back up. But if insecurity is about not having enough money to live on, they wondered, what would happen if we just gave everyone enough, with no strings attached? What if we simply mailed every single Canadian citizen\u2014young, old, all of them\u2014a check every year that was enough for them to live on?It would be set at a carefully chosen rate. You\u2019d get enough to survive, but not enough to have luxuries. They called it a universal basic income. Instead of using a net to catch people when they fall, they proposed to raise the floor on which everyone stands. This idea had even been mooted by right-wing politicians like Richard Nixon, but it had never been tried before. So the Canadians decided to do it, in one place. That\u2019s how for several years, the people of Dauphin were given a guarantee: Each of you will be unconditionally given the equivalent of $19,000 U.S. (in today\u2019s money) by the government. You don\u2019t have to worry. There\u2019s nothing you can do that will take away this basic income.At that time, over in Toronto, there was a young economics student named Evelyn Forget, and one day, one of her professors told the class about this experiment. She was fascinated. But then, three years into the experiment, power in Canada was transferred to a Conservative government, and the program was abruptly shut down. The guaranteed income vanished. To everyone except the people who got the checks\u2014and one other person\u2014it was quickly forgotten. Thirty years later, that young economics student, Evelyn, had become a professor at the medical school of the University of Manitoba, and she kept bumping up against some disturbing evidence. It is a well-established fact that the poorer you are, the more likely you are to become depressed or anxious\u2014and the more likely you are to become sick in almost every way. In the United States, if you have an income below $20,000, 2 you are more than twice as likely to become depressed as somebody who makes $70,000 or more. And if you receive a regular income from property you own, you are ten times less likely to develop an anxiety disorder than if you don\u2019t get any income from property.\u201cOne of the things I find just astonishing,\u201d she told me, \u201cis the direct relationship between poverty and the number of moodaltering drugs that people take\u2014the antidepressants they take just to get through the day.\u201d If you want to really treat these problems, Evelyn believed, you need to deal with these questions. And so Evelyn found herself wondering about that old experiment that had taken place decades earlier. What were the results? Did the people who were given that guaranteed income get healthier? What else might have changed in their lives? She began to search for academic studies written back then. She found nothing. So she began to write letters and make calls. She knew that the experiment was being studied carefully at the time\u2014that mountains of data were gathered. That was the whole point: it was a study. Where did it go? After a lot of detective work, stretching over five years, she finally got an answer. She was told that the data gathered during the experiment was hidden away in the National Archives, on the verge of being thrown in the trash. \u201cI got there\u2014and found most of it in paper. It was actually sitting in boxes,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere were eighteen hundred cubic feet. That\u2019s eighteen hundred bankers\u2019 boxes, full of paper.\u201dNobody had ever added up the results. When the Conservatives came to power, they didn\u2019t want anyone to look further\u2014 they believed the experiment was a waste of time and contrary to their moral values. So Evelyn and a team of researchers began the long task of figuring out what the basic income experiment had actually achieved, all those years before. At the same time, they started to track down the people who had lived through it, to discover the long-term effects. The first thing that struck Evelyn, as she spoke to the people who\u2019d been through the program, was how vividly they remembered it. Everyone had a story about how it had affected their lives. They told her that, primarily, \u201cthe money acted as an insurance policy. It just sort of removed the stress of worrying about whether or not you can afford to keep your kids in school for another year, whether or not you could afford to pay for the things that you had to pay for.\u201dThis had been a conservative farming community, and one of the biggest changes was how women saw themselves. Evelyn met with one woman who had taken her check and used it to become the first female in her family to get a postsecondary education. She trained to be a librarian and rose to be one of the most respected people in the community. She showed Evelyn pictures of her two daughters graduating, and she talked about how proud she was she had been able to become a role model for them. Other people talked about how it lifted their heads above constant insecurity for the first time in their lives. One woman had a disabled husband and six kids, and she made a living by cutting people\u2019s hair in her front room. She explained that the universal income meant for the first time the family had \u201csome cream in the coffee\u201d\u2014small things that made life a little better.These were moving stories\u2014but the hard facts lay in the number crunching. After years of compiling the data, here are some of the key effects Evelyn discovered. 3 Students stayed at school longer, and performed better there. The number of low-birth-weight babies declined, as more women delayed having children until they were ready. Parents with newborn babies stayed at home longer to care for them, and didn\u2019t hurry back to work. Overall work hours fell modestly, as people spent more time with their kids, or learning.But there was one result that struck me as particularly important. Evelyn went through the medical records of the people taking part\u2014and she found that, as she explained to me, there were \u201cfewer people showing up at their doctor\u2019s \\[office\\] complaining about mood disorders.\u201d Depression and anxiety in the community fell significantly. When it came to severe depression and other mental health disorders that were so bad the patient had to be hospitalized, there was a drop of 9 percent in just three years. Why was that? \u201cIt just removed the stress\u2014or reduced the stress\u2014that people dealt with in their everyday lives,\u201d Evelyn concludes. You knew you\u2019d have a secure income next month, and next year, so you could create a picture of yourself in the future that was stable. It had another unanticipated effect, she told me. If you know you have enough money to live on securely, no matter what happens, you can turn down a job that treats you badly, or that you find humiliating. \u201cIt makes you less of a hostage to the job you have, and some of the jobs that people work just in order to survive are terrible, demeaning jobs,\u201d she says. It gave you \u201cthat little bit of power to say\u2014I don\u2019t need to stay here.\u201d That meant that employers had to make work more appealing. And over time, it was poised to reduce inequality in the town\u2014which we would expect to reduce the depression caused by extreme status differences.For Evelyn, all this tells us something fundamental about the nature of depression. \u201cIf it were just a brain disorder,\u201d she told me, \u201cif it was just a physical ailment, you wouldn\u2019t expect to see such a strong correlation with poverty,\u201d and you wouldn\u2019t see such a significant reduction from granting a guaranteed basic income. \u201cCertainly,\u201d she said, \u201cit makes the lives of individuals who receive it more comfortable\u2014which works as an antidepressant.\u201d As Evelyn looks out over the world today, and how it has changed from the Dauphin of the mid-1970s, she thinks the need for a program like this\u2014 across all societies\u2014has only grown.Back then, \u201cpeople still expected to graduate from high school and to go get a job and work at the same company \\[or\\] at least in the same industry until they\u2019d be sixty-five, and then they\u2019d be retired with a nice gold watch and a nice pension.\u201d But \u201cpeople are struggling to find that kind of stability in labor today \u2026 I don\u2019t think those days are ever coming back. We live in a globalized world. The world has changed, fundamentally.\u201d We won\u2019t regain security by going backward, especially as robots and technology render more and more jobs obsolete\u2014but we can go forward, to a basic income for everyone.As Barack Obama suggested in an interview late in his presidency, a universal income may be the best tool we have for recreating security, not with bogus promises to rebuild a lost world, but by doing something distinctively new. Buried in those dusty boxes of data in the Canadian national archives, Evelyn might have found one of the most important antidepressants for the twenty-first century. I wanted to understand the implications of this more, and to explore my own concerns and questions about it, so I went to see a brilliant Dutch economic historian named Rutger Bregman. He is the leading European champion of the idea of a universal basic income. 4 We ate burgers and inhaled caffeinated drinks and ended up talking late into the night, discussing the implications of all this. \u201cTime and again,\u201d he said, \u201cwe blame a collective problem on the individual. So you\u2019re depressed? You should get a pill. You don\u2019t have a job? Go to a job coach\u2014we\u2019ll teach you how to write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or \\[to join\\] LinkedIn. But obviously, that doesn\u2019t go to the root of the problem \u2026 Not many people are thinking about what\u2019s actually happened to our labor market, and our society, that these \\[forms of despair\\] are popping up everywhere.\u201d Even middle-class people are living with a chronic \u201clack of certainty\u201d about what their lives will be like in even a few months\u2019 time, he says.The alternative approach\u2014a guaranteed income\u2014is partly about removing this humiliation and replacing it with security. It has now been tried in many places on a small scale, as he documents in his book Utopia for Realists. There\u2019s always a pattern, he shows. When it\u2019s first proposed, people say\u2014 what, just give out money? That will destroy the work ethic. People will just spend it on alcohol and drugs and watching TV. And then the results come in. For example, in the Great Smoky Mountains, there\u2019s a Native American tribal group of eight thousand people who decided to open a casino. But they did it a little differently. They decided they were going to split the profits equally among everyone in the group\u2014they\u2019d all get a check for (as it turned out) $6,000 a year, rising to $9,000 later. It was, in effect, a universal basic income for everyone. Outsiders told them they were crazy. But when the program was studied in detail by social scientists, it turned out that this guaranteed income triggered one big change. Parents chose to spend a lot more time with their children, and because they were less stressed, they were more able to be present with their kids. The result? Behavioral problems like ADHD and childhood depression fell by 40 percent. 5 I couldn\u2019t find any other instance of a reduction in psychiatric problems in children by that amount in a comparable period of time. They did it by freeing up the space for parents to connect with their kids. All over the world\u2014from Brazil to India\u2014these experiments keep finding the same result. Rutger told me: \u201cWhen I ask people\u2014\u2018What would you \\[personally\\] do with a basic income?\u2019 about 99 percent of people say\u2014\u2018I have dreams, I have ambitions, I\u2019m going to do something ambitious and useful.\u2019 \u201d But when he asks them what they think other people would do with a basic income, they say\u2014oh, they\u2019ll become lifeless zombies, they\u2019ll bingewatch Netflix all day.This program does trigger a big change, he says\u2014but not the one most people imagine. The biggest change, Rutger believes, will be in how people think about work. When Rutger asks people what they actually do at work, and whether they think it is worthwhile, he is amazed by how many people readily volunteer that the work they do is pointless and adds nothing to the world. The key to a guaranteed income, 7 Rutger says, is that it empowers people to say no. For the first time, they will be able to leave jobs that are degrading, or humiliating, or excruciating. Obviously, some boring things will still have to be done. That means those employers will have to offer either better wages, or better working conditions. In one swoop, the worst jobs, the ones that cause the most depression and anxiety, will have to radically improve, to attract workers. People will be free to create businesses based on things they believe in, to run Kotti-style projects to improve their community, to look after their kids and their elderly relatives. Those are all real work\u2014but much of the time, the market doesn\u2019t reward this kind of work. When people are free to say no, Rutger says, \u201cI think the definition of work would \\[become\\] to add something of value\u2014to make the world a little more interesting, or a bit more beautiful.\u201dThis is, we have to be candid, an expensive proposal\u2014a real guaranteed income would take a big slice of the national wealth of any developed country. At the moment, it\u2019s a distant goal. But every civilizing proposal started off as a utopian dream\u2014from the welfare state, to women\u2019s rights, to gay equality. President Obama said it could happen in the next twenty years. 8 If we start to argue and campaign for it now\u2014as an antidepressant; as a way of dealing with the pervasive stress that is dragging so many of us down\u2014it will, over time, also help us to see one of the factors that are causing all this despair in the first place. It\u2019s a way, Rutger explained to me, of restoring a secure future to people who are losing the ability to see one for themselves; a way of restoring to all of us the breathing space to change our lives, and our culture. I was conscious, as I thought back over these seven provisional hints at solutions to our depression and anxiety, that they require huge changes\u2014in our selves, and in our societies. When I felt that way, a niggling voice would come into my head. It said\u2014nothing will ever change. The forms of social change you\u2019re arguing for are just a fantasy. We\u2019re stuck here. Have you watched the news? You think positive changes are a-coming? When these thoughts came to me, I always thought of one of my closest friends.In 1993, the journalist Andrew Sullivan was diagnosed as HIV-positive. It was the height of the AIDS crisis. Gay men were dying all over the world. There was no treatment in sight. Andrew\u2019s first thought was: I deserve this. I brought it on myself. He had been raised in a Catholic family in a homophobic culture 9 in which, as a child, he thought he was the only gay person in the whole world, because he never saw anyone like him on TV, or on the streets, or in books. He lived in a world where if you were lucky, being gay was a punchline, and if you were unlucky, it got you a punch in the face. So now he thought\u2014I had it coming. This fatal disease is the punishment I deserve. For Andrew, being told he was going to die of AIDS made him think of an image. He had once gone to see a movie and something went wrong with the projector, and the picture went all wrong\u2014it displayed at a weird, unwatchable angle. It stayed like that for a few minutes. His life now, he realized, was like sitting in that cinema, except this picture would never be right again.Not long after, he left his job as editor of one of the leading magazines in the United States, the New Republic. His closest friend, Patrick, was dying of AIDS\u2014the fate Andrew was now sure awaited him. So Andrew went to Provincetown, the gay enclave at the tip of Cape Cod in Massachussetts, to die. That summer, in a small house near the beach, he began to write a book. He knew it would be the last thing he ever did, so he decided to write something advocating a crazy, preposterous idea\u2014one so outlandish that nobody had ever written a book about it before. He was going to propose that gay people should be allowed to get married, just like straight people. He thought this would be the only way to free gay people from the self-hatred and shame that had trapped Andrew himself. It\u2019s too late for me, he thought, but maybe it will help the people who come after me. When the book\u2014Virtually Normal\u2014came out a year later, Patrick died when it had only been in the bookstores for a few days, and Andrew was widely ridiculed for suggesting something so absurd as gay marriage. Andrew was attacked not just by right-wingers, but by many gay leftwingers, who said he was a sellout, a wannabe heterosexual, a freak, for believing in marriage. A group called the Lesbian Avengers turned up to protest at his events with his face in the crosshairs of a gun. Andrew looked out at the crowd and despaired. This mad idea\u2014his last gesture before dying \u2014was clearly going to come to nothing.When I hear people saying that the changes we need to make in order to deal with depression and anxiety can\u2019t happen, I imagine going back in time, to the summer of 1993, to that beach house in Provincetown, and telling Andrew something: Okay, Andrew, you\u2019re not going to believe me, but this is what\u2019s going to happen next. Twenty-five years from now, you\u2019ll be alive. I know; it\u2019s amazing; but wait\u2014that\u2019s not the best part. This book you\u2019ve written\u2014it\u2019s going to spark a movement. And this book\u2014it\u2019s going to be quoted in a key Supreme Court ruling declaring marriage equality for gay people. And I\u2019m going to be with you and your future husband the day after you receive a letter from the president of the United States telling you that this fight for gay marriage that you started has succeeded in part because of you. He\u2019s going to light up the White House like the rainbow flag that day. He\u2019s going to invite you to have dinner there, to thank you for what you\u2019ve done. Oh, and by the way\u2014that president? He\u2019s going to be black.It would have seemed like science fiction. But it happened. It\u2019s not a small thing to overturn two thousand years of gay people being jailed and scorned and beaten and burned. It happened for one reason only. Because enough brave people banded together and demanded it. Every single person reading this is the beneficiary of big civilizing social changes that seemed impossible when somebody first proposed them. Are you a woman? My grandmothers weren\u2019t even allowed to have their own bank accounts until they were in their forties, by law. Are you a worker? The weekend was mocked as a utopian idea when labor unions first began to fight for it. Are you black, or Asian, or disabled? You don\u2019t need me to fill in this list. So I told myself: if you hear a thought in your head telling you that we can\u2019t deal with the social causes of depression and anxiety, you should stop and realize\u2014that\u2019s a symptom of the depression and anxiety itself.Yes, the changes we need now are huge. They\u2019re about the size of the revolution in how gay people were treated. But that revolution happened. There\u2019s a huge fight ahead of us to really deal with these problems. But that\u2019s because it\u2019s a huge crisis. We can deny that\u2014but then we\u2019ll stay trapped in the problem. Andrew taught me: The response to a huge crisis isn\u2019t to go home and weep. It\u2019s to go big. It\u2019s to demand something that seems impossible\u2014and not rest until you\u2019ve achieved it. Every now and then, Rutger\u2014the leading European campaigner for a universal basic income\u2014will read a news story about somebody who has made a radical career choice. A fifty-year-old man realizes he\u2019s unfulfilled as a manager so he quits, and becomes an opera singer. A forty-five-year-old woman quits Goldman Sachs and goes to work for a charity. \u201cIt is always framed as something heroic,\u201d Rutger told me, as we drank our tenth Diet Coke between us. People ask them, in awe: \u201cAre you really going to do what you want to do?\u201d Are you really going to change your life, so you are doing something that fulfills you? It\u2019s a sign, Rutger says, of how badly off track we\u2019ve gone, that having fulfilling work is seen as a freakish exception, like winning the lottery, instead of how we should all be living. Giving everyone a guaranteed basic income, he says \u201cis actually all about making \\[it so we tell everyone\\]\u2014\u2018Of course you\u2019re going to do what you want to do. You\u2019re a human being. You only live once. What would you want to do \\[instead\\]\u2014something you don\u2019t want to do?\u2019 \u201d\"TLDR: Economic insecurity\/poverty is a leading cause of depression and anxiety and a main detractor towards having a fulfilling life. UBI could be an answer, but we need to make it happen.

So either don't do it or die.I unfortunately had a choice when it was only 10ml... The taste and the burning made me reflect.It was an impulse decision. Though suicide as a whole had been planned since... Months? And maybe all was not lost. Maybe I could still survive.And so... I chose to ask for help. Bam... There's a floor of tourists who call themselves my family.Forgive me but I am quite pissed off by them now because when I was clearly telling them that I was gonna have serious issues, they ignored and went home.And now they have the guts and balls to talk to me about how suicide is not the last way, have you tried yoga? Pray to the gods, dear, etc etc.More than a hundred people know. Out of this, I personally would have told... 20 max.And all this because I was kept under hospital care for less than 12hrs. Everyone under their breath is saying the same thing \"what an odd fellow, what a horrible thing he did! Didn't he think of his dear mother?\"GOD!! I want to tear my hair out...Yes, fucking uncle who hasn't set foot in this house since he and his brothers insulted my mother years ago...... I DID think of my mother.I did think of my step father. And I did think of everyone else.Suicide is not the last door. Most definitely not... Just next to suicide is the door of \"partial suicide - pity and pain welcome\".Suicide is just the door we choose when all the other doors seem impossible. When we've ran down the hallways and checked them all.In the span of less than a week... I've been called abusive, obsessive and possessive.All three seperately.Fine. I'm the fucking villain.Then let the villain be defeated!! No?? Why not?? Does your God say no??Will neighbours look down upon you because your son did something so bad that you cannot even name it!??Does the social opinion matter at THIS time?God... Fucking Indians. They only care about what their \"society\" thinks of them.\/Rant-----I'm certainly deflecting my problems... But yeah, I needed to let it out to any Indian out there: There are other doors if you look hard enough but if you choose this door of suicide... Please be careful. Have a talk with people who matter first... Gauge their reaction. Because no suicidal method is guaranteed to kill you. And if you live, you'll have to live in this shadow.I will, at least. Forever. My in-laws and their family know too... I mean the length that things spread.I didn't want to die. Not a single one says I'm glad you stopped. Everyone says why did you even speak the word \"suicide\"? Perhaps I'm missing something here.India is a nightmare.----Truth be told, I still want to live. I never really \"fully\" wanted to die. But the doors I see... They keep closing whether by my hand or automatically.It's difficult. I'll do everything possible to make sure I don't have to kill myself... But if I'm ever back here... Where months and months of suicidal thoughts all come out at once... If I am ever acting on impulse again, I will make sure to commit to it. No more half ass attempts where people either pity you... Or ridicule you.I just hope it doesn't come to that. I don't even want to plan again. I am on meds since a couple weeks... On therapy too. Hopefully I can just... See a door which I can actually touch.Doubt anyone is going to reply... I type too much, I know. To you who reads the last line only: Hope you're having a good day!","218":" I used to live in a small town in India and I was academically very good. Well for our town standards I was good. It all started when I joined University for Bachelors. First semester went by as I was struggling to figure out new life and the ***first semester*** results were out. I have failed in *4 courses out of 10.* It was a shock for me cause I have never failed in a course the least grade I got up to that point was B. I didn't knew how to handle it and I cannot share it with my parents cause I was such a bright student. I was slowly falling into **depression** but most of the teenagers don't know that they are **depressed** especially when they are experiencing it for the first time. In order to escape reality and keep my mind stable I used to ***Binge watch TV series until I was asleep*** and go to classes the next morning and I couldn't concentrate on classes as I was occupied by the fear of failure, letting my parents down etc. So I cleared 2 subjects from first semester but again failed in 4 subjects ***Second Semester.*** After clearing some every semester by the end of ***Sixth Semester*** I had 16 backlogs left and my future was uncertain and by that time I stopped going out with my friends and I used to feel like I was stuck in some box and looking real world through that box as everything moves so quickly around me. I used to get **nightmares** like not able to **graduate**. Then I realized something all these three years I was looking for some help. Someone to tutor or guide me to pass in those courses then I realized only person who can help me is myself. I sat down and tried to remember that happy go lucky kid 3 years ago and made a schedule for every thing and decided not to give up. I took a little time every day to go out and meet people, hangout with them so that I don't fall deep into it and I started to achieve my small goals and started feeling confident and after 2 months of my Eighth Semester, I ***successfully graduated*** with average GPA and I didn't stop there I have prepared for GRE for 2 months cleared it with 90% score and I applied for Masters degree in USA and I hold MS degree with 3.6 GPA now.","219":"No one ever told me how hard getting better is. Everyone told me \"Just chill. Relax. Take the day off. Spend time with yourself or your cats. Do something you love and you'll get better in no time.\"Okay then. I was bedridden for a month. I chilled. Relaxed. Took 30 days off. Spend time with myself and my cats because no one paid me a visit except my aunt. Painted. A lot. And OHMYGOD will you look at that?! I. Am. NOT. Better. In fact, I'm worse. I'm miserable. I don't wanna get out of my bed. I don't wanna talk to people.  I don't wanna do anything productive because I feel like I'll fail before I start it. I can't remember important things. Can I remember anything from my syllabus? Nope! Can I tell you about this one manga I read 5 years ago?  YES! And what's worse is how my mother, who is a psychologist, insists I'm faking my depression to get out of things because, hey, since I am a teeny tiny bit smart, apparently, I am so fucking gifted. It's irritating. And annoying. She calls me name. At times, even asks me to go and whore myself out because that's what I'm good at as I can't score the highest in class.My therapist told me that I should get away from my parents and how the fuck do I do that?! I'm from India. I'm a girl. My parents won't let me go. So, I thought, \"Hm. If I can't go, how about I adapt and try to tolerate everyone until I get my degree, get a job and gtfo?\"Well, HAHAHAHA! That failed. I can't do it.The more I work on myself, or try to, I realise how much I fucking hate myself. I can't physically bring myself to love me. And, two days ago, my boyfriend said, \"How do I know you love me? You can't even love yourself. How can you, possibly, care for my feelings when you don't care about yours?\"It hurt. Like, is the fact that I'm not killing myself, doing my best to not cut myself, I am not overdosing on pills and instead, facing him and being vulnerable around him not enough?I just regret being born. And, it's so weird, like, I don't know what the emotion is? But, my mother often says that she'd be happy if I were a boy. That she regrets giving birth to me. Well, gee mom. I didn't ask to be born. I am always trying not to give up... But.. I don't know how long I can do this.. I just don't.","220":"I am going through crisis. Now my problem may not be the most severe in nature, but i think they are impending my life in big ways. I am a 36 year old male, of east Indian origin, living in Michigan for over 9 years. I have a good job, in the mid-level managerial position. I earn good amount of money. My life is comfortable, where i can afford pretty much anything that i desire for. I have a very good family(back in India) and they are supportive of me. I think i have always been depressive\/pessimistic in my life. But my major problems started when i got engaged to a girl from India in my late 20s. Immediately after my engagement, i was diagnosed with diabetes. This, along with the fact that i was living outside of India, the girl decided to end the engagement. Few years down the line i was introduced to another girl and after short deliberation we decided to get married. This was again an \"arranged marriage\". My second engagement and first marriage did not last long and after almost 2 years of marriage we decide to part ways. Now I am divorced and live alone.My current situation is miserable. I have no interest in doing anything. I have absolutely no one in the radius of approximately 500 miles of where i live, whom i can call a friend. I just get by my days one day at a time. I dont leave my apartment very often. The best time of life is when i am at work, surrounded by my colleagues. I have no social life. To top it all, i have become hypertensive and on medication. I am decent looking man with fat body. I try to go to gym, but then i feel so down by the end of the day that i just dont leave my apartment. I have given up on feeling and looking fit. Why bother!!!I crave for companionship, but dating has never worked for me. I dont know how to date, never dated in my life. I have joined multiple dating sites, but never ever received interest from anyone. I am not an introvert, but i dont know how to approach opposite sex. I am not open to building new relationships, even a friendlier relationship with same sex. I used to be active and fit. Now i dont want to do anyting. I have lost my mojo, as they call it. I need help, but i counseling has not worked in the past for me. It seems i will probably end up a lonely old man and die alone.","221":"&gt;Because everyday, children walk in to this schoolhouse to glimpse their futures, to ask for hope. They may not know they need it yet, but they do. And I'm here to tell you that hope is real. In a life of trials, in the world of challenges, hope is real. In a country where families go without health care, where some go without food, some don't even have a home to speak of, hope is real. In a time of global chaos and instability where our faiths collide, as often as our weapons, hope is real. Hope is what gives us the courage to take on our greatest challenges, to move forward together. We live in cynical times, I know that. But hope is not up for debate. There is such a thing as false science, there is such a thing as false promises, I am sure I will have my share of false starts. But there is no such thing as false hope. There is only hope.-Matt Santos *The West Wing*I always really really liked that speech, because hope can never be false. For the past year I've been so depressed. This is country, my home, the one my father worked so hard to bring my family to from India, taking shit jobs to give us a better future than he had growing up in a poor 13 person family.  I was born in this country, fun fact my birthday is actually the fourth of July. I loved this country so much. And since Trump was elected I was extremely depressed. Things seemed to get worse and worse. Everyday we found out that he betrayed us more and more, he was a rat who sold our country out to the Russians and billionaires. Every day I would see 5 more headlines and get more upset. So defeated that I couldn't do anything about it. My wife and I went of birth control a few months ago. We want a family so bad. But every day I think about how much worse it's getting out here. Every day I see another video of a cop shooting a black kid for no reason. Of a white supremacist getting on stage and I stead of being laughed at *getting cheered on*. I have a good job but not a formal education (yet). I talked to my wife about leaving. Trying to emigrate to a country that had it's shit together so we could give a better life for our children likey father did to me. However with just a highschool diploma I doubt I'd get a visa anywhere. Nonetheless I didn't want to see my country crumble and fail. I wasnt just sitting on the couch griping. I was fading in and out of the real world lost in terrifying thoughts. I was crying and distressed constantly by myself. I did not want this to happen. I just felt so beat down, there are so many problems. What can I do. There's no way I can help, can fox anything, this country was destined to rot and implode. But today went on to some Democrats campaign sites and I saw hope. I saw them vocalizing the very issues I care about. Describing perfect what I believed this country should be. I saw hope. I know this isn't a typical post. I'm not sure if this is allowed. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind or stand on a soapbox or canvass for votes. I just wanted to share with someone, after months of feeling destitute and depression that today I had a glimmer of hope. And I'm going to do what I can to keep it alive Thank you for listening.","222":"So, there is a bit of a story here so this might be long.&amp;#x200B;Firstly, I live with my parents and sister at the moment, parents are in 60s, I am 20, sis is late 30s. My parents are from an extremely conservative and old fashioned environment. Where I'm from the general attitude to things like depression and mental illnesses is that it's fake.&amp;#x200B;My dad is well, he's an alcoholic who smokes heavily, and abuses drugs. (IMP Note: Abuses in the sense that he doesn't take medication which he REALLY needs to take out of pure stubbornness rather than well. Take it.)&amp;#x200B;He has been hospitalized 11 times so far for it all. And his general attitude is one of someone who is such an arrogant, toxic asshole, that me, my mother and sis argue over who has to stay with him should something happen. His own friends, coworkers and brother have cut him out of their lives almost entirely now. We're pretty much all he has left but that doesn't stop him.   Also VERY IMP NOTE: The culture of where I'm living right now (India) is that the elder of the family can do whatever the fuck he wants, and that the younger family members have to deal with it. Combine that with  the fact that he's the father and he has a free pass to be a complete and other toxic waste of humanity.&amp;#x200B;My mother is one of those extremely melodramatic people who enjoys tragedy in her family so she can create drama and lament to her friends. and my sister has the delusions that despite all that, we can be one big happy family (we can't) so yeah no one ever bothers to keep him in check.&amp;#x200B;Mother has the above thing, as well as the fact that she's extremely old fashioned and pretty much a terrible human being so yeah, she is not fun either. More than enough times she will actually try and squash you down and make you feel like shit if she actually she's you being happy. A fact that both me and my sister have noticed and commented on.&amp;#x200B;Sister is a little better, but she was raised by a boarding school, as well as my dad's brother and his wife. So she has almost never had to deal with them until 2-3 years ago when we all moved in together for now. So when it comes to the say of who is right on who is a bad person, her kid brother or her own parents. She sides with the parents.&amp;#x200B;Last year I used to go to a public hospital to get antidepressants as you can imagine all of that has well...&amp;#x200B;I'm depressed, suicidal, anxious most of the time, got a lot of pent-up rage, and am an insomniac, you tell me.&amp;#x200B;So for a few days I used to go there, and get meds and everything was fine, until my mom one day found them. Her immediate reaction was akin to the \"Depression is fake.\" mentality she has and just said that I was 'Scared for exams because I never study' she told my sister later on about this. She was initially supportive and took me to a psychiatrist and got me medication.  This went for about 2 weeks, then they stopped everything, and took me off all the meds cold-turkey. and declared that I was lying about it all, and that I was doing a fake drama about mental illness because I was lazy and don't want to work hard.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;So yeah.... that's the reason why the only thoughts that genuinely give me relief right now are of them suffering.   I might be a horrible person for that, but I stopped caring about that at this point because at least now I know for sure the kind of people \\*they\\* are.","223":"I just need someone to talk to. My parents hate me. I\u2019m a failure socially and at school and I have no motivation. My family in India has disowned and hate me for coming out. My parents friends kids just got into colleges like UC Berkeley and I can\u2019t fucking pass some classes. I just want the pain to stop. Please. This subreddit is my last resort and I want to talk to other people who are experiencing the same thing. I want it to end","224":"I have decided to end my life with Pottasium cyanide. This is my first post here and probably last. I love this community I come here daily just to read and go through all the different experiences people share. Now back to my story, I will keep it short. I am 28 years old from Delhi, India. I didn't have bad childhood or any problems I can think of. After completing my school I joined merchant Navy in hope of completing my dream of having a lot of money so that I can have and give a good life to my parents. Ever since I was in merchant Navy I felt this incline towards negativity and that's the time I started smoking too, I don't do drugs although I have tried but they ended up making me more miserable in my head. The negativity continued for a while and I had bad experience with bully superiors on my 2nd ship they used to make me work 20 hours a day non stop manual labour with no chance to go anywhere ( since I am on ship only option was to jump in ocean). While this was going on I even tried to break my own wrist with an iron wrench so that I can get off the ship due to medical emergency but that didn't work out. After 3 months that  horrible period ended and I went home to study and do courses to give exam for becoming an officer. I passed all exams just one interview left and I still don't know the reason to this day I never was able to give that exam. I used to book it but then lost confidence in myself. After 3 years of attempts and living on mere cents of money I decided to try my luck in having a job near home till I can finally get back in navy. Worked for more than 3 years. 3 different jobs .did good at jobs but those jobs were just sucking the life out of me. Constant calling. 15 hours a day labour. 2 hours driving. Negativity rising inside. All my life I always wanted to have someone to love who loves me back too but I failed again and again. Falling for girls who already loves someone else. To cope with this I started mobile gaming , a game called Clash of Kings. I played this game just as fun in beginning but as you know these games require money to play as you level up and want to stay in competition. In my desperate attempt to get over my negativity my lost confidence my issues I played this game and I actually enjoyed and got too much involved in it .I met so many people from different countries made many freinds and also met the most wonderful woman of my life. I will call her Bonnie here . Bonnie met me in the game in September 2017. She is 7 years older than me with a kid. The most amazing person I have ever seen. Always helping people In game in real life. Smart, beautiful,and angel in small words. We connected almost immediately. She wanted me to get better in life. She supported me . I quit my job and decided to go for a career of my liking and she supported me emotionally and financially. I decided to go and learn tourism industry which is my passion and skill. We tried together for more than an year. We have never met but loved each other. Then the problems started I was too much passionate for game and this was coming between my sleep. On her advice I went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life and found out that I have been in severe depression since last 8 years of my life. Oh btw I forgot to mention above that I tried to end my life 2 times before both by taking heavy dosage of paracetamol or Tylenol as in USA. Didn't work. So to make this long story short . I failed at everything in my life repeatedly. Relationships freindships work .. everything I failed..and now due to continuous sadness I lost my woman too.. there are a lot of things in between which I just can't write as it will be too much to write. Taking pills for depression or trying therapy I have tried all. I just don't see any purpose in life. I am actually not even sad anymore. I don't even cry or feel like crying. I just feel no purpose . nothing. I feel totally empty. So I have decided to buy Pottasium cyanide. Also I forgot to tell that I have a lot of money problems such that I cannot even afford to go to doctors anymore since insurance doesn't cover it and I have no income and no will to start working again. I am poor basically. So what I decided is take Pottasium cyanide and use my credit card to go somewhere nice in the hills or maybe Goa and then just 2 3 days of living my life partying and then drink the cyanide. I feel inside this will be complete life for me. A feeling of closure. I don't know why I am writing this here or what I wrote above. Just wanted somewhere someone to know or remember me or maybe remember me for a very short period of time. Love you all. See you on the other side \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","225":"Hello guys this is my very first post on this subreddit..today I got my results which is very bad ...my parents are upset..they don't know what to do now .I gave my 100% nd worked hard throughout the year..paid.

I nearly pulled the plug on myself, but stopped short of it. I'm now recovering. And I want to help others. I wrote a poem about it.REFLECTIONS A reflection,Tear-stained and smiling,Hiding the screams,The night brought so oft,A map of scars faded and fresh,Like crimson sprigs of fern,Braiding the pale wrists,A network of untraversed roads,To an abandoned heart,Haunted,Uninhabited,Freezing the soul,Suspended in an alien reality,Brimming with laughter and joy,So near, yet so far,If only it was possible,To touch the warmth outside,And disrobe this funereal insulation.\u00a0A reflection,Tear-stained and smiling,A dagger clenched in the hand,A newfound strength,To commit away,The mind promised,The final pain,The final scar,A little more pressure,And the steel incised the tender skin,First a slight drizzle,Then a steady darkened flow,Seeking refuge in the undusted carpet,A confluence of pain and peace,Ebbed along,The heart throbbed,Trying to save what remained,But the soul was already escaping,For it had waited for so long,For this elusive redemption,And here it was,At the very threshold,Of what it had only dreamt,So the heart finally gave up,Razed down like a falling house.\u00a0A reflection,Tear-stained and smiling,Held a photograph,Damp with grief and regret,A memory so unreal,It didn\u2019t belong here anymore,If only she had known,How much she is missed now,How many hearts were stabbed,By the dagger she used,Bleeding tears for so many,Breathing as if it were a sin,Living in a limbo,Wishing ghosts were real,To hear her forgotten laughter,To hug her and tell,The world was always there for her,If only she had welcomed it in.(If you are in need of help, you can always\u00a0talk to me.\u00a0There are people who are ready to fight with you and survive it with you.

The past couple of weeks have been particularly bad, I've broken down crying multiple times and I feel like I have no motivation at all. I don't think my family or my SO really understands why, and so I find it hard to explain them or even ask them for help. A lot for the times it seems like I just get hit with a wave of sadness and can't stop crying for hours. My family\/ SO ask me why I'm crying but I don't usually know myself. I get very nervous trying to ask for help and I'm not so sure what to ask for either. I feel like I might be burdening them.[Edit] Things have been getting better, I'm slowly getting through to my SO but my family will still take a long time. They're immigrants from India to the US.

I did my bachelor's in Medical from India cause my parents wanted me to do it. Now, I'm doing Master's in Health Management cause it sort of gives me a chance to get permanent residency here. I know it seems very shitty but let me explain everything from start, so please read the following and save me. I have few things to make you understand me better. I don't like people, can't stand them. I don't like going to city. I hate crowd. I can't make eye contact. I don't have any feelings left except for sadness and sorrow. I have approximately paid $22000AUD to come and study here. I knew the circumstances and people I would face and I thought I could do it but I can't. I didn't want to live in India among fucked up minds. I know it seems bullshit but you don't know what it was like to survive there. I don't think I would take so much space if I don't go back but I know every other Indian also think about it too. They want to stay here forever but believe me I'm not like them and yes I know I'm not special. I don't want to live in society and be a part of it, I just need nature and peace. I just want to follow my passion of writing and leave everything. I don't want to put anybody in bad light especially Indians for a residency thing. I'm a fucked up person and I couldn't care about anything else even if I wanted to. Sometimes, I think about disappearing and not coming out for several years. If I do this, my parents would have nobody as I'm their only child and that's the thing, that I don't have any feelings left for them and I know this is extremely fucked up thing. That's why I think about committing suicide but I don't even have courage to do it cause there are so many things I need to do before I die but this damn depression is fucking me everywhere. I don't want or need anything. Please free me from all these fucking liabilities, from all these obligations, just let me live. I don't want to talk to psychiatrists, I know what they'll say. I can't live like this, don't know what love is or if it's real or can it save someone. I think of it as an illusion and only this melancholy is real. Now, I know how the people go crazy and lose their sanity. I can't fathom all of my thoughts into this post and you can't understand what I'm trying to say as this medium of interaction is still somewhat limited. But, please, still try to understand what I'm saying. I won't be able to live this way for long. The conclusion is: I can't study this course, it's so uninteresting and the amount to do it, is so high. If I pay back $22000 to my parents, they would still think of me as a disappointment as I couldn't complete my study after I always wanted to go abroad to study. I'm in total depression, you don't how it feels to just die every second. I can't explain what this is. I just need someone to sit with me and understand me and give me the answer whether right or wrong and kill me. This Earth is a fucking cold dead place that only gives you reasons to die. There are still so many things that need to be said but if I  write them, it'd make no sense. I don't want to go back and I don't want to be a part of society here. I just need a fucking hippie life without a care in the world, smoke weed, write something, make something and die.","230":"First , I'll start with how I'm right now. I havent interacted with my school friends since feb of this year and it was only to talk about exams and nothing else. I havent hanged with anyone since oct of last year. Im not eating at all. Seeing and smelling any food even if it was my fav makes me cringe. I can go entire days on one meal or less. Ive started to doubt myself a lot and I'm getting regular panic attacks where i get suicidal , my body starts to shake , i get headache and i cant do anything but cry and get hopeless. Ive never tried to self harm but i do get thoughts every now and then. nightmares are something im so used to at this point that theyre not even scary. I was getting sleep paralyzed as well to the point where i got used to it. I even have problem falling asleep and even when i do sleep i cant sleep for more than 5 hours. last year i was super clingy , i used to make sexual jokes to make others laugh and i used to seek attention from everyone. i was never bad at concentrating and studying. but this year i cant help but feel down. its now normal thing. isolating myself from everyone , leaving everyone on read , not picking up phone calls and making up excuses. i just changed and became complete opposite to what i was last year. last year i tried to fit in and this year i dont care about anyone anymore. i even get super bad mood swings. like im all laughing one moment and next moment im either suicidal or want to murder whoever tries to talk to me&amp;#x200B;so now ill start with a bit of my backstory and then a bit about my parents cuz for me theyre the reason. so im from india and mental health issues are something asians take seriously. i was a super loud and energetic kid. i was quite good at drawing and creating stories and i was always proud of my creations be it a story or a manga. i used to represent school in art competitions as well and my art teacher had a lot of confidence in me that ill be super successful if i pursue something in field of anime. since 4th grade i watched a lot of anime getting inspired by them and started to write my own mangas as well. i was above average in studies as well so my teachers used to let me skip their classes to draw if my grade werent suffering which they never did i was always around 85%.&amp;#x200B;for my dad my grandpa died when my dad was around 17 years old and had to take care of grandma who was abusive and his siblings who worked with him. thats all i know from his past but my dad is extremely narcissistic where he believes hes always right. he refuses to believe facts and gets angry whenever i put facts in front of him. i even told him that i had panic attacks and i was anxious for exams and that i had confidence issues and i wanted to get therapy but he told me \"just dont be scared\" and continued to yell at me for being scared and started to compare his past to mine. he always points out and mocks whatever i do. im not even exaggerating. he told me that coffee doesnt have caffeine and that its a lie and doesnt believe doctors as well cuz he \"knows\" from experience. he even mocks the way i study like if im lying down and reading a book he will mock me. if im reading articles on laptop he would mock me to read a book.&amp;#x200B;for my mom she had a super fancy and comfortable childhood. my grandparents are super lovely and they live in expensive place. so my mom is basically someone who wants best for her and doesnt care about anyone in family. she also doesnt care about facts.  she would always fight with dad for not getting enough salary when we are in no debt. she always compares dad to his brother and its always saddening hearing them fight everyday. it doesnt get violent though. its still humane enough but still it started to bother me. she always act like a small child who needs people around her and if she needs something done then it has to be done instantly or else she would turn it into drama and make herself look like victim. she makes fuzz out of every small thing. last year i had a lovely girlfriend who told me to write my feelings in diary and my mom found out about it and started to mock me for thinking about self harm.&amp;#x200B;so basically i never had any say in any of my life decisions and i know they want best for me but i still feel like i cant do what they want anymore. ive graduated from highschool and wanted to pursue manga art and wanted to move to japan but my parents lied that they would let me. now for 1 straight year theyre constantly making me change my future. first marine then fine arts then graphic designing then engineering. ive wasted an entire year cuz they are forcing me into doing something i dont wanna do and now theyre blaming me and saying \"i wasted my entire year cuz i wanted to do all this and that my friends are toxic and theyre making me fail at life\" first i havent talked to my friends in months second my friends know nothing about what i wanna do third i never said yes to anything except marine engineering and they forced me into all other things. it just hurts seeing how blinded theyre that they cant see what i want and are again forcing me into computer engineering. blaming me and my friends for everything they had done for entire year is just breaking me and i cant even trust anyone anymore. i dont even feel like talking. but still it feels like other people are going through worse and im just being weak. my current girlfriend is trying her hardest as well but i feel like im bothering her too much.","231":"Hi all,I am a psychology research student from San Francisco State University, currently working on a research project focused on **depression apps available to Indian users.**I am looking for honest opinion on apps (CBT apps or apps providing psychiatric and psychotherapy services specifically) that you have found useful in dealing with depression. I would like to know which of your therapy needs they fulfill successfully and how they help you in managing depression. I am also interested to know the areas where they fall short or fail to cater to your needs.If any of you use such apps, I would love to know your thoughts. I am listing out some apps below that I came across. If you use any of them, let me know your thoughts.

For my bachelors, I graduated in the top 1% with accolades. Hated Masters but got through with 3.25 GPA. Worked for 6.5 years in the USA until my final employer essentially fired me for underperforming due to the major depression. That fine day in May 2004, I was in senior year of high school. I had Physics and Chemistry tests the very next day. I had just been to the hospital and was given massive doses of antibiotics for bronchitis for over 15 days. Was diagnosed as hypothyroid. Was in a prep school kind of scenario - so EXTRA pressure and stress. That day, my brain stopped being interested in anything anymore. Got into serious depression and anxiety. Obesity, insulin resistance, PCOS and CFS followed. Still suffering despite in numerous medicines, psychiatrists, therapists, ECT treatments, diet and lifestyle changes, supplement additions and everything in between. Tried a bunch of nootropics. Finally came across some back often recently- somehow helps in combination with my Effexor.I\u2019m not sad anymore- get suicidal when I quit medicines for a day though. But the anhedonia and depersonalization\/ de realization are VERY STRONGLY present.I was an excellent student- straight As from kindergarten: excelled at extra-curricular stuff, class monitor, prizes and accolades. Obese, so terribly low self-esteem. No friends. Thought if I just worked hard, made a good life, my success would help me get over the fact that I had no social life and no pleasures in life- not even access to a TV or computer. Okay, I decided after crying everyday for the past 15 years that I can\u2019t get out of bed, I need to do something I can remotely stand, to be able to get close enough to a normal and productive life as possible. See that inability to study and perform in my senior year, got my scores down low enough that I couldn\u2019t pursue medicine or bioengineering as I had always wanted. My whole life, I worked for that. I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. But I did and still do- I\u2019m too scared I will not be successful with suicide. I\u2019ve enrolled in a Data Analytics degree- essentially some computer stuff and math. I need to do some pre requisites and also start on the course. But I CAN\u2019T STUDY. I am not interested. I\u2019ve been procrastinating for close to 13 months, deferred my admission to this Fall. I have no more time though. Failing in this will only set me back- cause all those emotions about not being good enough to come rushing back. I can\u2019t handle anymore failure. Already have a soul-crushing \u201canything-I-do-will-turn out to be crap\u201d vibe going for me- it scares my family why I\u2019ve had such bad luck going for me for so long. As a result of losing my job, I was forced out of the country and had to come back home to India. I gave up my apartment, sold my car, my belongings and moved in with my parents, had another stint at the mental hospital, have very little money to my name.But all this can change. I have plans to complete this degree and get a stable job, where I\u2019ll have more security and creative freedom. Build my life again. And then follow my passion and pursue a Bachelors, Masters and doctoral degrees in biology\/ bioengineering from Europe ( no age limits, is cheaper and better). I can build all that back- do everything I\u2019ve wanted to do and more.BUT I CAN\u2019T STUDY. It used to be my identity. I was always identified as the good student. Getting good grades was all I had going for me.  All those years of hard work did go down the drain, yes.  But I still have time. If only I can bring myself to care....Can anyone relate to this? I\u2019ve lived like this for 15 years. I only did well in my Bachelors because I paid attention in class and took notes- never used the textbooks. To this day, I cannot read a book. I understand the loss of passion with depression. But why am I rebelling against myself when it comes to doing something productive with my life- I\u2019m never interested in anything to do with my professional life. But the other part of me that drove me to be a good student all my life is still intact- the two personalities are tearing me apart. I\u2019m constantly guilty about not meeting my high expectations, but I can\u2019t even do the bare minimum and at least give it a try. the indifference is astounding. Therapists have talked to me for hours- I\u2019ve never changed. How do I tell my brain that I won\u2019t be hard on it anymore- that I care for my body. That this studying or caring to do anything in life other than eat and watch videos from bed is actually good for me and may actually work?PLEASE SOMEONE, HELP ME STUDY!!! PLEASE, PLEASE.

I feel sad for those people who are considered idiots to go and seek out for help here. I was very lucky to have a progressive who didn't give a damn about the society and took me to a psychiatrist but i feel sad for those helpless people who are never given advice for fighting depression. There are kids out there who do not even understand what depression is and how it affects us. I hope this changes.P. SBeen fighting depression for that last 4 years of my life. It gets easier but we still have our days with each other. ","235":"Money is low, 36 hours away from ny phone being disconnected. Moving at the end of the month to be back with my mom, who can barely help herself. Hopefully any money I make can go to help her and myself. My brother probably won't graduate, just like I almost did. I helped raise him, so I feel responsible. Car still acting up 4 wheel drive just having trouble now too. I keep feeling like, \"Hey, at least this is rock bottom, can only go up, right?\" Then it keeps going lower. I try to remind myself that \"Hey, at least you aren't in that whole mess with India and Pakistan right now, or deployed, or fighting ISIS, or a refugee, or still being abused like you were as a child, or in Venezuela, or being sold as a slave.\" Then I go to the good things in my life.  \"Your family loves you, so much buddy. All of them. You are a pillar of the family, they are so worried for you, and wish they could do more. Please keep going for them. Your buddy Billy loves you as a brother man, he stayed with you that bad night. Bought you pizza, remember? Watched a couple movies. Your platoon and squad sgts care, got you in touch with that free shrink. Shrink cares, she just about cried when you told her all the shit you went through as a kid. See, life isn't so bad if all those people care.\"Now, this used to keep me going. Their love, affection. Made my heart swell with undying love. I would die for every one of them. But as time keeps going, rock bottom keeps sinking, time getting shorter, life harder. That love just turns to shame. It turns to grief, and despair. My depression getting heavier, and heavier. The more lost I am in the Valley of Darkness, who's evil I fear, for what if the Shepherd doesn't exist, and the blind man isn't even being led, but stumbling in his hour of need, no one to take his hand. God, it's so dark. My soul yearns for peace, but I am so plagued by the demons of the past, and my present. I fear, that the peace I will ever know, will only be in death.","236":" Unhappiness, discouragement and hopelessness about daily matters are familiar feelings to most people. Feelings of sadness are unpleasant when one is experiencing them, but they usually do not last long, dissolving on their own after a period of days or weeks.&amp;#x200B;Depression, however, is a medical condition characterized by changes in one\u2019s mood and sense of well- being. This mood disorder can make people feel sad, hurt, irritable, hopeless and helpless about the future which can result in the person losing interest in activities which were earlier enjoyable. It is commonly associated with reduced sleep (insomnia), though, at times individuals can have increased sleep. Appetite may be affected and there may be problems with concentration and energy levels. At times individuals can feel guilty and responsible for events that may actually be beyond their control. A person with depression can also have thoughts of suicide. Relationship difficulties and occupational dysfunction are often outcomes of Depression.&amp;#x200B;Depressed mood and sadness can influence the way individuals perceive themselves, others around them and the wider world.&amp;#x200B;SYMPTOMS:\u00a0Following are some of the symptoms indicating the presence of depression:* Significantly low mood* Loss of interest in almost all activities* Irritability* Decreased desire to eat or overeating* Excessive sleep or reduction in sleep* General aches and pains in the body* A tendency towards isolating oneself* Unmotivated and lack of confidence* Frequent crying spells* Impatience and feeling of no hope in the future* Low self- esteem, feelings of inferiority and worthlessness* Feelings of helplessness* A dearth of enthusiasm and low energy or fatigue* Difficulty in concentrating, difficulty making decisions and slowed thinking* Thoughts of death and suicidal ideas&amp;#x200B;TREATMENT:Treatment for depression is usually in the form of psychological therapy, or antidepressants, or a combination of the two.

I can understand that worrying about academics should not be considered depression exactly, but the fact that I'm worthless piece of shit brought me here. I usually am a wannabe funny guy who has really cool internet friends, but sometimes I think they talk to me just bcoz they feel bad for me. Its not like I'm an introvert or something but socializing doesn't feel like how it used to feel. I live in a small apartment with my parents, who are very strict and they expect too much from me, but I don't think i can live upto that. I see people my age doing so well in everything or atleast something, and I'm here just wondering when will I die. Sometimes i think my parents don't deserve me but then again its me who's always causing problems. I have literally no interest in anything and since I'm their only child, they keep on expecting too much from me. During this pandemic, if i could've studied a little, i think I might've been better than what I am now. Cuz right now ,here in India its the only thing that matters. Sometimes I hate the way my parents treat me, i just want to move out but then again, its India. I used to like gaming as a way to escape reality until my dad sold my PC. Everyday I wake up hoping that i would change but then i just keep on disappointing myself and everyone around me. I hate myself for everything I do.Sometimes I can't bare to stay with my parents so I go out in this 'gaming cafe', where i spend my saved up money to play this stupid games. I know its wrong to blame my parents, I can understand but they're too much sometimes. My mom is kindof dying, she has Parkinson's and my dad isn't that good of a person. He has a low salary job but he's not home most of the times. I feel terrible seeing my like this and I can't do anything about it, she hates me because I'm not much great of a son. I have some friends irl too but I don't like to bother them. Everyone has their own stuff to handle. I see people in relationships, hanging out together, having fun with their siblings, making their parents proud, which makes me hate everyone around me including myself. I barely even passed 11th grade and I think I'm nothing and even if I try to convince myself that I'm something I can't. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of being lonely, I'm tired of being nothing but a disappointment to my parents, I'm tired of being myself.","238":"So it's been two years, i am suffering from depression and a year for anxiety. People say mentally ill people don't have clear judgement and are unable to find solutions. So please help me. It started with never-ending headaches and i couldn't study(i used to be topper in class, as others say). Studying gives me severe headache which I can't bear and cry uncontrollably. I've been dropping for 2 years and not attending my 10th board exams, as people say this exam is crucial for getting job in india. I've been in medication for depression and anxiety for a year now. I've said to my psychiatrist that my headaches are severe and I can't study because of them so many times that he seems annoyed whenever i mention my headache. He says its because I don't study. But i can't study because of these headaches. I am stuck at this pit of no hope. Therapy isn't available here and i only get councelling which doesn't help me at all. My father used to take me to him every month. But now he has to drive my mom to her job. My mom has no holiday for 100 days. So i can't go to the doctor to fix my headache problem. My next school session is starting from march and i am not fixed yet. But i can't waste another year. I think I can never be fixed  and i have to live like this(with depression and anxiety) for the rest of my life. Internet says that if a child's been on depression and hasn't gotten out of it in year, chances are this is chronic depression. Medication have helped with anxiety but not with depression. Which means i can't do anything and will be a failure ending up as homeless beggar. There seems no solution. Nothing is working even after getting professional help. No relative is close enough to get me to doctor. Do you see any solution? If so please give me, I'm here without any hope.","239":"Idk if you guys know about this show called attack on Titan it's a show about freedom and how cruel the world is.It taught me that freedom in this world we live in unachievable, power corrupts people with power will always have the desire to gain more power which in turn takes away our freedom,Even if we kill all the \"unjust\/corrupted\/evil people\" in the world what is the guarantee that people will remain peaceful, there will be more people who get corrupted there will be more people who search for \"interesting things\" in their livesAnd the cycle will continue because this is how the human psyche is People with power and money have more freedom than the normal people even tho they aren't special Tge only way people can be free is acceptance all this caste, religion, race, social classes,etc shouldn't exist to be free From this I realised if I truly want to be free dying is my only option, I am soo tired off not being allowed to do what I like I have given up in soo much sleep just so I can do what I like to the point I am have memory issues now I am soo dumb I get bad - average grades even after knowing school is important in India cause of the stupidly massive population,I just don't want to accept the fact that I am dumb why am I soo dumb why am I such a burden why does anything I do not work why am I not able to fix my life even after trying my best So the only thing that can make me free from this pain is dying Idk who will read this long shit I am sorry in advance","240":"I feel so guilty when I think about killing myself. The only thing I want is to die. There's absolutely no point to my existence. I'm such a worthless piece of shit that I can't even justify my own existence. I'm still around only because of my family. I've lived with them for the past 8 months (was originally intending to move out in May) due to COVID. I'm moving out in February to college, but I plan to end my life before then. Likely in the next 10 days.I've been suicidal since I was 8 (back then I knew it only as \"kill myself\"). There's so many reasons why, but all of those are irrelevant now. My guilt is the only thing holding me back. I'm lucky to have grown up with parents and a sister whom I care about very much. I have no idea what effect my death will have on her. She's young (mid teens), but very bright and hardworking. I'm so proud of her and I know that she'll reach happiness. As her older brother, I've done everything I can to encourage her and help her for the past 10 years, and she's finally reached the point where she's independent and strong.I can't imagine how she would feel after hearing I'm dead. When I think about how my family would react to my death, I immediately have this pain that radiates outward from my heart to the nerves in my arms and it's so bad that I usually have to sit down. This has prevented me from planning anything further than the basics for a while. I have finally overcome this pain, for whatever reason, and I have a plan that will allow me to escape my own head and give my parents plausible deniability of my death to my sister (so she is not as impacted).I don't understand myself. Why am I suicidal? I think that it ultimately stems down to feelings of inadequacy and my inability to be happy. In high school, I was great at science. For sake of anonymity, I won't elaborate further, but I did well and I'm now enrolled in a great university. I always told myself that I would be happy after I did this, or I got into that, but it was never enough. There was always more and more and no matter what I did, I felt like a disappointment and a loser. This is of no fault to my parents -- they were never the traditional \"tiger parents\" that punished me for failure. I can never be the best. Even when I am, it's just a fluke. To anyone reading this, my ramblings are likely incoherent and irrational. But to me, all these statements make perfect sense. I know deep down that I cannot succeed, no matter how much I try, so there's no point in trying. I've tried to help myself, but I don't want to seek professional help. For years I've had bouts of suicidal thoughts lasting weeks and suddenly find something to distract myself with (usually academic) and return back to normal for a little. This no longer seems to be possible. I think about suicide actively instead of the passive thoughts I had several years ago. There is no escape. I feel constantly that I am inadequate, worthless, someone unworthy of success and unworthy of my dreams. I don't know when I changed from a curious, fun loving kid to a suicidal adult, but it happened somewhere within the last 7 years (I'm 19). I've made my choice and I've somehow rationalized it. Onto my plans. I live in a state where it's very easy to purchase a firearm. Over the past 2 years, I've saved up around 15k from competitions and jobs. I'm going to spend 1k to buy a cheap used car, pay cash for a firearm, drive out to a park in my state and commit suicide while leaving a paper trail with flight ticket reservations to India. I gave my parents access to my checking account so the rest of the money should go to pay for my sisters college fund. My parents will likely be informed that I am missing, with signs pointing to a suicide (any purchase of a firearm is registered with the government, so they would certainly suspect a suicide). I also have a note with details so they have some closure that will be released a week after I am gone. I think I am giving my parents the option to tell my sister that I have gone backpacking or some other hippie activity in Asia. This should make sense to her, as I have expressed interested in hiking and traveling for the past month. You might think it's sociopathic of me to lie to my sister like this. I have no way to respond. It probably is, but I'm trapped here. I need to die, but I also can't die with this guilt. I won't be dead tomorrow, but if my plans work out, I should be in 12 days. Apart from my family, the world won't miss me much. I doubt my friends will care more than a week out and I expect that my parents won't release the actual news (will just say I've gone backpacking or something). I actually had a pretty good time in school. I was a total nerd, but I was lucky to never be bullied since I'm tall and was the class clown. But I'm an adult now and those moments of distraction are over now. I wrote this post partly to get all this off my chest, but also to seek advice. I don't understand why I rationalized suicide. My situation isn't dire and I'm not struggling to survive, yet I somehow feel that there is no option for my future other than suicide. When I think about myself, I see nothing but worthlessness and failure. Why? If I can understand why, then I can include it on my note so my parents have some concrete reason other than \"I hate myself and I want to die\".","241":"19 years old, India, from a lower middle class family. Mom doesn't work. Dad lost his job due to covid. I have elder brother too and he's marginally better than better than me atleast. I consider myself burden to my family as I was always a below average student since 6th grade. My family made me go tution but still I can't score good marks. As of today I'm in college and seeing my dad in pain because of finance truly hurts me. So I decided to earn money to help my dad (without telling him) I came across many options but I decided to trade stocks and options because of attractive money making opportunity. The money I used was for my college fee my dad gave me plus I borrowed some from my brother. Now that money is completely gone. It started with small amount and gradually I lost it all. It was around $1400. That money is a lot of money for us. My dad said  me 2 years back that he couldn't live a good life but wanted me to live better so he spent huge part of his income for my studies. I am a complete disgrace. My dad has not seen my bank account's balance yet and last date to give college fee is 31st January. Its been about two weeks since I lost the money. I can't face my dad. I don't want to die either. I need help and the only way I see someone helping me is giving back the lost money, but why would anyone give money to a complete stranger like me. I begged for help in other subs only to find that  they require some minimum karma, which is understandable because of potential scams. Only thing stopping me committing suicide is the effort my dad put in me.  So I really don't know what to do now.

As expected, my parents rocked my world and it is well deserved. They are hysterical and are talking about taking me to India.

I fear that writing this down will just serve to \"ground\" my suicidal thoughts, like \"THERE, I WROTE IT DOWN! OTHER PEOPLE CAN READ IT!\" and that just makes it all too real.Nobody in my life knows that I'm suicidal. I'm 18M, from India. I've had a shit upbringing. My parents had a messy, prolonged divorce when I was in the 6th Grade. My father was abusive towards my mother, often hitting her in front of me and acting very violently towards myself and my mom when he got angry. I was molested by a close relative since I was 6-7 years old, up until when I was 13 or 14. I don't remember much of anything from my childhood except what he did to me, and my parents shouting and screaming at each other. I often ask myself If I liked being molested - I think I even participated in it voluntarily. It disgusts me. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was about 7 or 8 years old.Dad got my custody after the divorce. My mom had nowhere to go, her own parents refused to take her in. She ended up sleeping on the railway platforms for a few days before a friend took her in. her pride wouldn't let her take anything from my dad. Here's the thing about my mom - she's very self-centered. She is in a much better position now, with a somewhat stable income, a pet dog. She can pay the rent on time, and put food on her table. I feel guilty that I couldn't help her out. I know it's irrational guilt, but I still feel this way. But here's the thing about my mom - she is very self-centered. She has faced a lot in life, but she just won't fucking shut up about it. I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS TOO, AND NO ONE EVER BOTHERED. She has been spitting vitriol about my dad, my family, her family, and anyone really, for years and years. When I meet her and talk to her over the phone, It is always this. Not once has she asked me how my studies are going on, how the school is going for me, or just FUCKING ASK IF IM OK. NOT ONCE. She is suicidal and had attempted to kill herself several times. Last year, she almost succeeded. Once, she self-harmed while I was on the telephone with her. I want to help her, but I'm just tired, and can not find the strength. I know she loves me.I don't have a lot to say about my dad - he is very reserved. He and I rarely have conversations. He married a year and a half after the divorce. I rarely interact with my stepmom, but she isn't abusive or anything. My dad expects a lot of academic success from me - I am the first to take science. But he either does not get or does not care, for my emotional well being - all he has ever done is lionize me for \"going through these hardships\". That's it. We are a low-income family, and I know I have to make it.I love science. I like maths and physics most. I wanted to be a physicist. I haven't ever had good teaching or someone who would guide me about how to follow my passions and be successful at it. Here, in India, we have entrance exams that students sit for right after their 12th grade. Many students get coaching, many get private tutors. I have had none - my dad was never interested in finding out how to get me a good education, and I was misguided by what sources I had at my disposal. The exam is in 16 days... I think I'm going to fail. I feel inadequate and I sure as heck don't feel well prepared. I have been crying every day. I took to meditating when I feel overwhelmed, and that helps a bit. Yesterday, I pushed a nail into my arm until it drew blood. The pain felt good, like some sort of cathartic release. Academic success means a lot to me, and I do not know where I will be without it. I worked hard in school to become a model student and win as many competitions and exhibitions as I could. I even became head boy. It helped to distract me... I felt good achieving something meaningful. But now, even that has come crashing down. I can't stop thinking about just ending it - I can't find any meaning. I have no friends. All my middle school friends took to some activities I objected to (we never really had anything in common) and they gradually fazed me out. My GF is a year older and in college, and she continually tries to get my emotional support for her own problems. I don't have ANY SUPPORT TO GIVE. I don't blame her, she does not know about my suicidal tendencies.This is the lowest that I've felt in life, and I've been through some tough times. That is why I finally poured my heart out here. I just want to stop feeling terrible. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fact that mom would most certainly kill herself if she knew - and it's almost funny how I can't even fucking kill myself because of what other people expect of me. Sorry for the wall of text... I just had to get this out there. I have no one to talk to. Thanks for reading.","245":"I am student of class 10 in India and the biggest mistake I have done since I started my education is study well . When u study well in India then you have to keep pushing urself which is ok untill you know there Is a boundary till you can push urself to but there are none, so I have been just pushing myself without knowing why but everyone says I am not trying enough and because I live in India I can't seek help as there is nothing called mental health here so I used to feel suicidal when I just couldn't handle both family stress and the school stress as all wanted me too keep excelling and wanted me to do everything they wished for in a day but I can't be perfect , no one can but they expect me to be and that perplexes me . My family problem is that I have a sis who is 8 years older than me and always bullies me saying I have always been preferred and loved than she and that whene ever I try to talk about my feelings I just try to gain sympathy and even now while I type this I think I am just trying to gain sympathy which is weird and I have 0 confidence so I can't like just go up and talk to her my parents because the last few times I tried they just thought I was kidding and I have been laughing always cause my mother used to be alone in house and even she was feeling depressed for a few years because my father had a lot of work and would return late and my mother was alone in the house with no friends to talk to I would come from school as fast as I can and try to just keep her laughing and distracted from it as much as I can and did not care if it led to me becoming a fool or getting scolded but now they think u am always happy and whenever I get angry or cry they just say this is because of the damn computer a typical reason by an Indian parent and now the pressure of boards is also crushing me from inside and I wish that I just woke up dead one day but I don't have the courage to kill myself too so I am stuck in a situation where I just have to face it and can do nothing any help how I can just near it without any major problems and if I sound like a sympathy seeker please forgive me .","246":"My partner is sick. They\u2019ve been sad for so long now. I am suicidal too and have tried it several times. But the real reason why I\u2019m posting is to seek advice about something I am not able to handle. My partner told me they\u2019re about to kill themselves by this month end. And they are not scared but is excited about it and real calm. They told me they don\u2019t to want make it a bad thing. I know them so well but we\u2019re in different cities due to COVID and I am so broke to travel. (Literally 0 in bank). I don\u2019t know what to do. I love them so so much and I\u2019m in a dilemma if I should just join them, because I can\u2019t convince them to not to do anything, because they say they want to make it a good thing. So calm. I\u2019m scared. I haven\u2019t seen them this calm about their suicide ideation ever before. Please tell me what to do. I really can\u2019t call the suicide hotline or anything, because they don\u2019t have a supportive family. Also I\u2019m not there I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if the officials behave the way they doesn\u2019t want.

Prepared for a competitive exam was able to pass through the written examination but in interview today I just got wrecked by the interviewer due to me being a post graduate, and he felt that instead of writing the banking examination I should have instead gone for a PhD and the whole interview revolved around this thing only.I wasn't prepared for such questions as I thought the interview will mostly revolve around the banking sector.I just want a stable job for fucks sake. Every interview that I give end up this way only.I hope every day that I just stop existing somehow, the system is literally a torture here in India.I don't have the courage to commit suicide as I already tried it way back in 2017 and I know I don't have that amount of courage.But somehow I feel that I'll end up commiting suicide at some point in my life.

This thing started 7 years back,  I didn't know what I was suffering through that I can't concentrate on my studies. Seeing Fans or winds brings me anxiety. I secretly collected some money and went to the best eye doctors in my city(because my father would get angry or beat me up if he knew i was doing this cause he thinks i am just making excuses fucking third world country india you know) and he gave me just few drops that made my dry eyes more worse FUCk. I just do warm compresses to soothe my eye dry eyes. I just want to get a good college to get masters from so I can get a job and be fucking alone and maybe get a temporary cure for this dry eyes and maybe get high on drugs.

Only child to my parents. Just graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree with 90% and I'm totally clueless about what to do next. Some are suggesting me a Chartered Accountancy course and some are telling me to go for MBA (I have opportunities to go for Tier 3 colleges still will have to take loan). News are filled with lots of MBA graduates being unemployed and it's filling me with fear. Also, doing CA course requires at least 3 more years and there's no guarantee of passing it. I don't know if I have it in me to pass them in 1 attempt. I was almost in the same condition when I had dropped an year back after my 10th grade. I wanted to take Science then but I ended up with Commerce. Sometimes, I feel that I have taken a decision but then I start doubting myself again. I just have 3 people for whom I was working hard till now in my academics which are my parents and my girlfriend. But, now, I feel like I'm letting all of them down. I see no way out. I tried talking to tele counsellors too, the one set up by Government of India, but though they listen, they hardly have been of any help.I had big dreams. All I ever wanted was to give my loved ones an affluent life which we never had. I wanted to take them out of this misery where we have to be dependent on others. But, I feel like I have failed everyone. When most of the others have something or the other sorted out at this age, I am still struggling to find what I'm interested in. I feel like a loser.I tried consuming a lethal PVC solvent but then I feared abandoning my parents as I'm their only child.

Please help!","250":"I wish I was white because then life would be so much easier for me.

Every time I go out somewhere it\u2019s almost all white people and I\u2019m constantly envious they don\u2019t have to go through this because they\u2019re the majority. It must be so nice to not be a minority in the US. It\u2019s lifelong and I don\u2019t know what to do besides death.

Man fuck the government, fuck the education system, fuck life and fuck everything. I am 16 and my head pains as if my heart is placed inside my skull. I rarely play video games but those fucking online classes are killing me. My exams will start around 5 months now and I am so fucking stressed that I can't concentrate anymore on my studies and nor on the things I like. I mean they expect us to score on the top even in this fucking pandemic. Almost half of my day is taken up on those bullshit online classes, they are about 3 hours long and after that I feel so fucking tired I can't do anything. My head pains like shit, I can't sleep due to stress, I have stayed awake for almost two days without any sleep, my father nags at me like anything. No man, just fuck everything.","253":"My father is a top government official. He is very successful in his profession and unfortunately, very egoistic. Because of this, he made a lot of enemies at his work. They made a plot to ruin his life and sent anti corruption squad to raid our home. They couldn't find any illegal assets but now, everything we've ever owned is seized. Some are inherited and there's no way to prove the source of income for that. Many years of court battle, expenses on lawyers is ahead. I guess not much will be left in the end. My father is depressed because of the humiliation. I recall the night this happened - my father left me a message \"I am finished, take care of your mother and our family\" and shut off his phone. I thought he committed suicide, he doesn't know the trauma I endured that night. The next morning, we were able to contact him and he told me that he wants to fix his life and more importantly, my brother's life.About my brother, he has always been a smart student. He is extremely smart but poor in decision making. He topped his university in engineering and worked as a civil engineer. In India, it's an extremely competitive exam and only a few hundred can succeed out of hundreds of thousands of students. My brother quit his job to study for this exam as it's his dream as well. He's been trying to pass this exam for a few years but missed by few points. Then he decided to pursue MBA in an ivy league university and my father was very supportive. Because of what happened, it is not possible for my brother to go abroad anymore. We just don't have the money anymore. At the same time, our father lost a huge amount of money in the stock market during the covid crisis. Our family did not know he had bet so much money in it. My brother thought he could rely on family to do something else if he couldn't succeed in his exams. He is now blaming our family for ruining his life, his confidence. He resents them now. The truth is our family gave us everything growing up, never hit us or abused us. And now, my brother feels angry at our father for putting our family through so much trouble and he feels that he ruined his life. My brother is 28 now, can't go anywhere and has no interest in studying for his exams. He says he doesn't care about his life anymore. Just like my father, he once told me he's depressed and that if would be better if he died. He lashes out at family and resents our father. He wants to fix our father's mess and after that, he probably wants to commit suicide.I feel trapped in another country, I can't go back to my country because of covid. I'm trying to support my family, my brother. I suggested them to visit a therapist but they don't take any action. I send money every now and then, I send gifts to make my family happy but I'm alone here. I work 6 days a week to save money for them.There is a possibility that to win the court case but it'll take years. Recently, he told me that once this is all over, he's going to give all the money, properties, inheritance to my brother and told me that he wouldn't be able to give anything to me. I am fine that, I never wanted any of that but this made me clear how much he loves my brother compared to me. I'm not as smart or outgoing as my brother but I still work hard, I'm on my own feet and have a masters degree in IT. My father once told me that he thought I'd be a failure because of my shyness and being socially anxious. Everytime I get a message or phone call from my family, I get extremely anxious and prepare for the worst. It's been very traumatic.","254":"U might think this guy is so stupid, but listen. I was born in India, literally the shittiest country(no offence to any Indian).The people are soo bad, there is absolutely no cleanliness, and worst over population.My father was very abusive with my mother. Always used to beat her, and me and my elder sister were always scared of him. My mother committed suicide when I was 15 (year 2015). Since then l am always sad. My father remarried to my stepmom. And she just treats me like shit. Never have I ever felt a part of this family. She always cussed and me and my sis. Because of all this, my sister got a degree and left.Now since 2 years I am alone without any friends, no one. I m almost at the end of 12 grade. And let me tell you something In India everytime a child is born, the middle class parents thinks either he will be a doctor or engineer. After 12 there are exams Jee( Joint entrance exam) for engineering and NEET for doctors. 1200000 students sit and only 10000 qualify. The pressure is to much, because of the population we have to compete and every parent thinks that it is easy. I think about suicide almost everyday, but I won't do it. I don't have any friends, none of my parents think about me. I just feel trash. I wish I was born In Us. I hope someday I get out of this country and never come back.","255":"so I wanna kms if I get academically suspended, you see I'm a college student in America and my parents are immigrants from India so I have a lot of pressure on me to succeed. well if in the time span of Jan 7 to Jan 13 i find out that I have been academically suspended I feel like I have no choice but to kms.So talk me out of this","256":"After trying for 3 years I am giving up this competition for grades in India is killing me firstly I am extremely dumb and I can prove that with facts, I make terrible life decisions, I can't study under pressure especially when it's things I don't particularly have interests in. Like where ever I go the only fucking thing I hear as a student is how much grades you got how much you studying, that college IIT, etc. I am tired of this stupid rat race for grades even tho it is important I am just not smart enough for it so I am giving and am gonna start doing what I like( animation and coding)and see where is takes me even tho my parents don't support me  and if even that isn't working out Welp I am commit suicide cause life's not worth living when you are a dumbass and mentally weak af","257":"Now disclaimer I do not hate Indians at all themselves, I just hate being Indian and the stereotypes that come with it. I can feel my pure inferiority as I type it. I amount to nothing and what's the point of carrying on if I have to keep living like this. If reincarnation is real as I have been taught my entire life, then please let me born as black or white, just anything other than Indian. Even Pakistani would be fine with me. Bangladeshi, Nepali, Sri Lakan whateverI was born and raised in the west from an Indian family. They showed me little to no love growing up, abused me mentally, emotionally and physically, brainwashed me, denied me anything I wanted and kicked me out of the house at a young age. I couldn't even count the amount of times my father has told me to jump off a terrace in my life. My brother on the other hand was pampered and loved beyond anything else.The racial bullying got so bad at one point and they did nothing about it. i can remember it like it was yesterday. Every time I would go anywhere it was always \"ew whats that smell\", \"it stinks here\" despite me having showered and wore cologne that day, for those who don't know they were targeted jokes making fun of how Indians smell. \"Go back to your shithole, we shower in this country\". Among other thingsKids would come up to me outta nowhere slap me in the face and say \"hit back Gandhi\", and they were always in groups. too. They would tell me \"I'm not Indian, I'm not stupid\". \"he's stupid, he's indian.\" Couldn't go to the bathroom, as I would always get jumped and ganged up on, the kids would make jokes about how Indians shit ont he floor and how I'm \"not allowed in the bathrooms\". Now none of them would do it 1 on 1, I actually sent a kid to a hospital once, shattered his orbital cause I couldn't take after he had shoved me down in the bathroom and called me \"curry boy\" it but all his friends jumped in and I also ended up in the hospital as well. I always fought back when I was jumped, but to no avail. Admins didn't take it seriously so I'm on my own.And the worst part? This shit is not only condoned but encouraged. Racism against us Indians\/Asians in general always flies. Even mongoloid asians r defended more than us. Imagine if it were a black, or hispanic person getting bullied like this, all races would have a issue and it'd make headlines. Even other South Asians would bully me. For some reason pakistanis don't get half the negative stereotypes we do by others, so they would always tell me about how backwards I am because I \"worship cows\" and everyone else would also make fun of me for that. A group of boys threw lemonade in my face and said \"drink this cow piss, hindu\". And the thing is, they defend it by bringing up these stereotypes are based in truth.Drinking cow piss is a part of hinduism, and almost half of India does shit in the streets, they'd say. Always in class they would say \"do u shit on the floor?\" \"does ur mom shit on the floor?\" and I'd be called currymuncher and dothead all the time too. Another thing was when they'd make all the 7\/11 slurpee jokes and Indian scammer things.Ik what sum of u may be thinking. \"it's those alt right trumpie white people\" right? No. Surprisingly almost every single incident I had was racism from black people. I don't hate black people at all, and I have some black friends, but 99% of the racism I have faced here is from black people, and they get away with it perfectly fine cause it's just this country's logic that only racism towards them won't be tolerated.Also not to mention being Indian is a turn off for most girls as well. Even pakistanis have better luck here than we do. I been rejected time after time cause I'm Indian, for no other reason, ladies even tell me to my face that's why.God I can't tell you how much school I've missed trying to avoid it too. I'd get beat up and called racial slurs almost every day. The streetshitter jokes got so annoying ad it took a toll on my mental health. I may have been wasting my life staying home and playing video games instead, but it was better than going to schoolThe last straw was when I was in a public bathroom not too long ago. I saw one of my old classmates from before the virus struck, he immediately recognized me and said \"I thought i smelled curry\" and then he caught me by surprise, took my neck and locked me in a rear naked choke while yelling all kinds of slurs.I felt so fucking pathetic, how'd I let that happen to me? I cried myself to sleep for nights after that and just decided I'm gonna end my life. I'm going to wait till after christmas, but I know where my dad keeps his pistol. I'm going to take it, put it in my mouth and point upwards before pulling the trigger and ending it all. I hope if reincarnation is real that I will never EVER be born in this ethnicity again ever.UPDATE: You guys are so awesome, you made my day a whole lot better.

I need this outlet.I'm Indian and in my mid twenties, come from a fairly OK to do family, live and work in one of the major metros. Lived my entire life in Indian concrete jungles only (mom and dad moved around a lot). Financially, i do OK for myself. The money's not great but it pays the bills and i manage to save a decent chunk if it. I'm only doing this job for now cause it pays the bills. I don't think I'm depressed but just aimless and it's now driving me nuts. I know exactly why and it's quite simple: Pretty much all the stuff advertised to me as being associated with the good life doesn't appeal to me in any way: Fancy house, car, vacations, parties...... all that crap. Simply put, most aspects of life don't appeal to me. I'm not materialistic at all and only use my money for the essentials. I have no idea what to do with the rest of it. I've lost interest in everything and everyone. It's boredom rather than depression (do correct me if I'm wrong). I have nothing to aspire to. It's been that way for a couple of years now. I tend to try getting the real purpose of any venture or undertaking and it doesn't seem to get me anywhere. This has started to affect my social life. Almost everyone I come across thinks and talks about stuff that I have absolutely no interest in: career opportunities, cool stuff to buy, who partied where? who's making how much? who's dating who? Stuff that I simply don't give a shit about. I'm off mainstream social media, don't give a fuck about my LinkedIn account and have no clue what to do. Life does not make a whole lot of sense to me. I simply don't give a fuck about doing the stuff that regular people aspire to do: rise in your career, get married, raise a family, acquire a good reputation and retire rich. So I don't really see the point of living. Though I don't have moments of extreme sadness with how my life turned out or I turned out or wishing I could have regular aspirations like everyone else, I do feel like I'm just lying on a bed of roses watching life pass me by.I keep fantasizing about disappearing from everyone and everything, moving somewhere far away maybe to another distant country, start living and working on a farm or in the hills or mountains or something. In a country where no one's ever gonna even think of searching for me there (if it does come down to that). My idea of the perfect life there would be to keep things extremely simple: Rise, work on the farm till the evening and then take a break for the rest of the day: watch the sunset and the scenery, do some drinking, smoke some pot and then contemplate the meaning of life until bedtime. Keep doing this with the hope that I die in my early thirties. The idea is to get away from everything and everyone and be close to nature or to simpler people and not rot in an urban shit hole where almost everyone's caught up in a dick measuring contest.Except that I love and care too much about my family to actually do this. Plus given that I live in India where the ideas of status and reputation in society are so ingrained in you from the start, doing something like this would affect my parents reputation. Not that I give a fuck about mine.Anyone else feel the exact same way? I feel like there aren't a lot many people who feel this way.","265":"A friend of mine is in serious danger and we need your help. Please read till the end. And suggest some plans.Trigger Warning - Domestic ViolenceMy friend (Female - 20) is being abused by her father who has Schizophrenia. It started way back when she was 13. Due to some petty reason, he started beating her in a fit of rage and it was so bad that she sustained multiple injuries and could have died. She is not the only one suffering from this. It's her mother too.Her father was diagnosed with Schizophrenia a couple of years back and then her family found out the reason behind all the violence. They started giving him medicine from time to time, and the situation improved a little. But it is still bad. There are frequent occasions of domestic violence and it is bad.It is affecting her mental health a lot. She tried convincing her mother to file an FIR against the father but unfortunately her mother is reluctant. For easy conversation, let's call my friend Karol and her mother Jess. Karol needs to leave the place because she's very certain that she'll get murdered by her own father. The violence is increasing again and she's getting more and more paranoid. It's affecting her health, her sleep and her academics. She wants to leave but she doesn't want to leave her mother alone in that scary place... Alone with her father. Anything might happen.And if both Karol and Jess leave together, her father may wreak havoc on their neighbours. Maybe that is one of the reasons Jess won't leave. Because they have relatives living nearby and stuff.They talked about this matter with relatives too. And they went to confront about this matter with her father. And he's so good at acting. He pretends like he understood everything and it was a misunderstanding. Just after the relatives leave, he pretends to be normal and waits till 11\/11:30pm before starting his violence again. It's so messed up.According to us, the best solution is to get some professional help by calling a helpline number or something. But we just want to ensure two things. One, that both Karol and Jess get out of that place and don't have to stay with the man. It's very dangerous. Two, that he doesn't come back to their life. He is so gooood at acting, he always escapes treatment. The thing with Schizophrenics is that they're super good with acting and pretending. They think that nothing is wrong with them and deny any such allegation. We fear that he might pretend to be normal and then come back to his normal violent self.Please help her out. It's getting so serious. She's getting more and more paranoid by the day. We need to get her out with a proper plan in 1-2 days. She feels like she could get murdered very soon. She has even tried to commit suicide once. And it's a recurring thought in her mind. I just wish we could help her - you and I.(Odisha, India)","266":"I am a stoopid 15 y\/o Indian boy who likes to draw and animate,my parents don't support me in anything fun ( drawing, content creation etc)i get terrible grades in everything except for the topics and subjects i like, whereas everyone around me keeps getting staright a's and are some how able to get really good grades in tests am i just thta fucking dumb?i lie a lot to my parents to save my ass , i am a terrible fucking human being, all my parents care about is marks and i have also heard them saying i am a mental and financial burden to themi have no friends my attention span is of a fucking babyi am retarded and make stupid decisionsI want to make art and animation my job but India doesn't have any studios that make hand drawn 2d animation (except for studio durga but they are in a loss ) going out the country is not a thing i can do cause money is a problem in my familymy parents want me to do engineering but i don'tgame dev seems fun but i am too stupid to get into computer science after 12th gradei want to end it allbut having that thought makes me wanna die more cause there are soo many people prolly in worse situations than me but yet they don't end it all why am i soo weak mentally compared to otherswhat do i do with myself please help me i don't want to be in this position anymore","267":"Please read my previous posts to get context:https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/comments\/idyt4f\/i_think_quitting_is_the_only_option_left_for_me\/https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/comments\/innosd\/this_is_my_last_attempt_to_get_help_before_i_do_it\/This \"family\" has made my life even worse than it was before. As you know already know, they have completely isolated me. But it's not only that. They do whatever they feel like and completely neglect my opinions on literally everything.For example, when they bring any fancy food (like, sweets, chocolates, etc.), they happily eat their own share and leave my \"share\" (which is usually much less than theirs) on the table (without telling me anything) and go about their day. When I don't eat my \"share\" (please note that while I used to like food 2 years ago, I don't even like having any kind of food nowadays because of the state I am in; they already know my condition but they don't care), all 3 of them start bashing me by calling me \"selfish\", \"ungrateful\", etc. Excuse me?! I feel this way because of THEM and they blame ME?! After they have finished bashing me, they happily eat my \"share\" without any regret.They even cause chaos in case of COVID-19. They go out for unnecessary reasons (like shopping fancy clothes) very frequently. When they return home, I tell them to do certain things, like washing hands with soap and sanitizing certain objects (like the things they took out with them, the non-food items they have bought, the handles of doors and door knobs they have touched after coming back). But they DON'T LISTEN. They just say that I am insane for telling them to do this because \"no one\" in our country (India, a country where people openly cough and sneeze here and there and even throw their mucus on the road, even during this pandemic) does it. Excuse ME?! I am trying to protect THEM and they are accusing ME of being insane?! I literally have to argue with them for around 30 minutes to make them do all these things. But they still try to avoid doing it. When I firmly tell them to do all these properly, they just scream at the top of their lungs and tell me that I am insane because apparently \"no one\" does these things. They compare me with the other citizens of our country (the citizens who, again, don't even wear masks, openly sneeze and cough here and there, throw their mucus in the road, etc.) and say that they are much better than me and accuse me of harassing them. They literally believe that we (specifically) don't have any chance of being infected by COVID-19. When I asked them why, they could not even give any valid reason. They only accused me of saying unholy things when I tell them that everyone has a chance of being infected by COVID-19, including us. WTF?!They constantly say that I am mentally sick for behaving in such a way and not to pay any attention to me. They even went as far as mixing anti-psychotic drugs (Olanzapine) with my food behind my back (when I refused to take this \"medicine\" by myself because it was severely affecting my physical and mental health in an extremely negative way) the last time they took me to the psychiatrist (who, as I have already said in my previous post, did not even listen to what I had to say and was only interested in prescribing me as many medicines as posible). They have even threatened to throw me out of the house multiple times. They say that I am just a nuisance to them.They constantly compare me with the other citizens in literally each and every aspect of my daily life. They never ask me WHY I wake up late (please note that I cannot fall asleep before 6 a.m. everyday because of my mental state), WHY I have my meals late, WHY I don't like eating, etc. They just compare me with \"everyone else\" and blame ME for literally everything that is apparently \"wrong\" with me, from waking up to going to bed. I have heard them talking amongst themselves about me behind my back countless times. They say that I behave this way because apparently I am \"insane\". They say that the reason I refuse to eat and  and feel this way is because of my \"hormonal changes\" and not to pay any attention to me. WHAT?! You mean to tell me that I feel like shit everyday because of my \"hormonal changes\", because I am \"insane\"? You mean to tell me that I have problems with eating, sleeping, waking up, etc. because of my \"hormonal changes\", because I am \"insane\"? And they don't even accept their fault. When I blame them for making me feel like this, they tell me that they apparently \"love\" me and that it is apparently MY fault for feeling this way. When I start trying to hold my ground and try to tell them that THEY are the reason I feel like shit, they, once again, start shouting at the top of their lungs that I am \"selfish\", \"ungrateful\", \"lazy\", \"insane\", \"a nuisance\", that apparently I am causing chaos in the house, that they'll throw me out of the house, etc. (just after a few seconds of them lying to me that they \"love\" me).These 3 have now started doing something suspicious. For the last couple of days (yesterday and today), I noticed that when I go for a bath in the afternoon, my step-mother enters my room, locks the door, opens her cupboard (her cupboard is in my room), takes something out, closes the cupboard, unlocks the door, and goes straight to the kitchen (where our lunch is prepared). As far as I noticed, my father and sister know about this and don't ask her anything. So, I guess it's safe to say that all 3 of them are involved in this act. I don't exactly know what they do but after having my lunch (yesterday and today), I started to feel SO AWFUL. I have a headache, feel dizzy, can't stand properly on my legs and I can't even think clearly. I think they are, once again, mixing some kind of drugs in my lunch before giving it to me (as they did before). What the HELL should I do? As I have already said, I just want to die (even those 3 know about this but they don't care). I think leaving this existence is the only way I'll ever get peace. But the thing is that there is a high chance of me surviving my suicide attempt and being arrested by the police (there is such a law in India, which I have already mentioned before) and living the rest of my life with some kind of disability. I am completely trapped. What should I do?","268":"Hello everyone,I am writing this post because I want to share what I have been going through since a few months. Got noone with whom I can share this. So sharing it here. Just want to share it with someone. A bit long, so apologies for that in advance but I want to get it all out. The whole of it.Lately I have been having these thoughts were I wish I was dead or some car hit me or I was one of the Covid-19 deaths. I think I am a very strong person but last few months have broken me utterly.I am an Indian, 26M, currently unemployed and homeless. I have been a failure. I couldn't achieve anything in my life and it seems the rest of my life will be spent this way. Atleast a decade for me to get out and even have a decent life.To give you some context, I have always wanted to be a physicist. Got a chance to study in one of the best institutes in India for my Bachelors. Future seemed hopeful. But while I was building my career, my father ruined his.Since I was born, he has solely worked to give me and my younger brother a decent life. He has worked very hard to give us a better life than he had. And he did the best he could. In his quest to give us all he could, he never did anything for himself. Both my parents sacrificed everything for us.When I was doing my B.Sc while doing a part time job to support myself, my dad for the first started to do something for himself. He was planning to earn some funds, business expansion, when he can no longer work. He did not want to rely on his kids even though I would love to take care of both my parents for as long as required.But his plans failed royally and got into a lot of debt. He did everything he could to fix the situation but he couldn't. Not alone. I decided, against my father's wishes, I could put my education on hold and help him. I could resume it anytime.Together we did our best. After some months, my dad has paralysis and could no longer work. Still, I did as best as I could.But now I no longer can. Our business had to be closed down permanently in the pandemic. I am struggling to get a job. My parents moved back to our village while I got a small room to live in the hopes of finding a job. That failed as well and I was evicted (didn't pay rent) a week ago. Staying with a distant cousin until I can find some alternate arrangements and it seems I will find one soon... Only it will be a prison because I have defaulted on all my debt since months. There have been days where I survived on bread and jam because that's all I can afford.Oh and on top of that, I was doing some freelancing and my laptop stopped working. Can't afford to get it repaired. Just real FML.*******My biggest disappointment is that I couldn't repay to my parents for all the sacrifices they made. I had so many dreams. The primary goal being earning decent enough that my parents can go to sleep every night without stress and worry. Secondary was becoming a physicist. I have failed them and myself.Now I think I will spend rest of my 20s and early 30s clearing up all the debt. I have no hopes of ever being able to resume my education. Will probably get a job which I don't like but need to survive and live the rest of my life until I finally die. No hopes of ever giving my parents the happiness they so deserve. I am so fucking scared that this is my life for the foreseeable future.That thought is eating me up. I don't usually cry. I probably have cried 2\/3 times in all of 2010s. But now I have cried so many times in the last few months just thinking about my bleak future. Sometimes I am just fine but then suddenly get sad and start crying.The worst part is I can't share what I feel to anyone. I am a social anxious person who is also very introverted and shy. I don't have many people to talk to except my parents and one best friend. But I can't share what I am going through with them. Sharing it with parents will only make my father feel even more guilty (he already feels a lot of guilt). For some reason, I can't seem to be able to share it with my best friend. He doesn't even know the whole story. I haven't been able to share it with him. That's why I felt here I could share the whole essay of my life.That's when these ideas of what would happen if I died started popping up. Will my parents be able to move on? Will it hurt? What painless options? Will Our business insurance take care of the debts? Will my absence even make any significant difference?Honestly, if I knew that I could bite the bullet and avoid any negative impact on my parents, I probably would have done it by now. But deep down I know that's not going to make their life any better. It will only be worse.I wi have to live. I will have to live through this miserable life...this hopeless life. But still... I could have peace if I only decide to end it all.To anyone who reads this, thank you for listening. Sorry if it's too long. Really wanted to share my story,the whole of it and what I am feeling now with someone.","269":"Just jumping off the building, it's tall enough. 15 years of abuse and torture, I don't see a way to get out of it and I don't think I can hold out any longer.EDIT: This is to answer the commentsI'll keep it short bc I'm tired of going online and thinking that some forums and stuff and finding out that it costs like $80 fcking for a month of service. Basically my dad is very abusive mostly on a mental level with me and sometimes physically. He lied to me and turned my entire career plan(basically anything related to music) upside down by bringing me back to India and putting me in a school that doesn't even fcking have any music from 9th grade onwards. I wish I could run away but I still have to help my mom and my brother bc I love them.","270":" second time writing this lol, i don't know what this is I just high so. I really want to die, I think I would be nice, no more anything. I genuinely hate everything. some things are nice, but they do me no good. But sadly, suicide prevention tactics work and I don't want to traumatize my family. Maybe when they are no longer hear, I could do it. but till then I'm just living every day walking around thinking in my head. I hardly talk to anyone. BOth out of choice, and force. I have no social skills, I've never made a real friend, nor do I feel like I've ever bonded with anyone, not even my dog. The love I do give her is mostly bc I feel like she needs it. DOnt get me wrong i do have dream and goals. I want to travel the world, every state in America, Canada. Europe, India, Japan. I also want to create art for a living,(this is the dream, as, this will never happen). Create shits prints, art pieces(i want to create one great portrait in every medium), music( i want to learn every instrument too), I want to take a picture worthy of a magazine, ads, or just design websites.

I wanna jump from high spot to take my life. Please tell me where can I die.I live in India. I have a girlfriend who loves me so much. She loves me so much that I would do anything to keep her mine. But Indian people don't believe in love. Her family is gonna marry her to someone else. Now knowing that she loves me so much but I can't get her makes me so depressed that I just wanna die. I really can't live without her. She is my life man. If you take my life it means I am gonna die","272":"I (16M) currently live in India with my father, step-mother and elder sister. I heard that my biological mother prayed to God (I am an atheist while my family is religious) for having a son (for no particular reason, she just wanted to have a son). You must think that my mother really loves me right? No. You are wrong. She divorced my father and left us (including me) two years ago. We were a broken family then. We are still a broken family now.Now, I currently have severe depression, anxiety, OCD, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and intermittent explosive disorder. I have lost my hunger, my sleep (I sleep at around 5:00 am everyday) and my happiness (or rather blissful ignorance). I do not go to school. I simply cannot because according to me, it's just meaningless. School is just a place where there is only mindless competition. The \"students\" just compete with each other in the exams to get more marks (by rot-learning and forgetting everything after giving the \"exams\") and brag about it. They do not actually gain any \"knowledge\" (as it is called by the society).For the past few months, I have realised some painful truths regarding this world and life. I will not write all of them here because it'll be too long but in short, I have realised that we are all going to die someday but people in this world still keep on breeding (in a dying planet which is full of chaos) and create problems and chaos for the others. They don't give a fuck about others. They only care about themselves. I went to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist for depression. The psychologists just kept on saying bullshit like life is worth living, that you have to fight, etc. and did not even listen to my points. The psychiatrist just gave me a couple of medicines and a dozen of tests because \"he wanted to see why I could not understand reality\". WTF? You know what? My parents did exactly as the doctor said despite of me telling them that the doctor could not understand me. When I started my medication, I felt so awful that I could not even think about ANYTHING. The medicines just made my mind handicapped. I told my parents about this. But they just said that I HAVE to continue the medication because the DOCTOR gave it me (the same psychiatrist who did not even understand me). I finally stopped taking the medicines after a HUGE chaos in our house. A few months ago, we went out for shopping. My family pressurized me to go and talk with a salesman despite knowing that I have social anxiety. My father just said, \"How the hell will you take care of me when I get older?\" That day, I realized my purpose in life. It was to become a slave to my parents. Whenever I try to talk to my \"family\", they just keep on ignoring me. They just tell each other to not pay any mind to what I say and that I am insane. They don't even care about me. Everyone in this family (except me) has someone or the other to share their feelings with (and they do it all day). My sister has her friends and boyfriend. My father has his friends and step-mom. My step-mom has my father (she only cares about him and herself). They don't even take COVID-19 seriously. All 4 of us have had symptoms of COVID-19 (one after another) but only I took it seriously and wore a mask whenever I was near them. I repeatedly tell them to wear a mask while being near each other, wash hands after sneezing and coughing but they don't listen. My step-mother is strictly anti-mask (while still having the symptoms of COVID-19). Whenever I tell them that there is a chance that we might have caught COVID-19, they just simply say that I am pessimistic, that I am insane, that I am saying unholy things, etc. and shout at me. They are full of shitty ideas. They believe in trash like homeopathy and superstitions (both of which I hate). Whenever I try to tell them that these things are illogical, they just start bashing me and tell me to keep my \"beliefs\" to myself and don't tell them about it. A few days ago, we had an incident where my father and I got slightly injured. But my sister and step-mother just tended to my father. They gave him medicines and ointments and sympathized with him. They didn't even look at my injuries. I could not even walk properly for a few days because of my injuries. They absolutely did not give a damn about me. It seemed like I was non-existent. This \"family\" has completely isolated me ever since I started trying to tell them my thoughts and how I feel. I am completely lonely in this selfish and cruel world. You know what? I did not sign up for this. I can't eat, sleep, etc. without thinking about how people just keep breeding for such selfish reasons. I think I am going insane because of this hatred. I just want to die. But the problem is that there is a law in my country (India) that people who attempted suicide and survived, will be arrested. The Indian society just cares about staus and money. They just want to breed and force their children into becoming doctors, engineer, lawyers and pilots so that they have enough money to take care of their parents. Everyone in here just cares about getting rich, settling down and having children (who are supposed to be taking care of their \"parents\" and listen to them at once; basically slaves). Please help me. What the hell should I do?","273":"Hey guys.I'm (18M) going to get straight to the point. I'm from India, at university in the US. I'm doing fairly well in school, i'm fairly fit and love exercising. I also have a two 'close' university friends, a bunch of other casual ones and my old highschool friends back home.My problem? I've never been in a romantic relationship. Never. Not one girl has ever taken interest in me. Sure, I talk to them, and a few are quite close as friends, but I've never been in an actual relationship. All of my friends are in one, and while I'm extremely happy for them and they are quite supportive of me, I feel worthless. I'm never going to be good enough. Recently my 23 year old friend proposed to his partner, and again, I'm really happy for him, but at the same time, I feel like I will never get to experience what he is. Add on to this the fact that my parents are somewhat stereotypical indians, and I don't know I will have their support or if they even want to see me get together with someone (this probably isnt true; my mom actually asked me a few times if I got a girlfriend). I know I probably sound like an edgy teen or that this issue is trivial or very common, and that things will get better. This probably isn't even real depression right? I'm sorry if I misused that word. Past few weeks, this realization and feeling of being absolutely worthless to anyone as anything but a fucking resource or means to get work done has been fucking with my head hard (this probably isn't even true, but the scenarios just keep going on in my head and this is my current mindset). I'm probably just blaming my inability to get someone on my parents. I've cried alone in my room multiple times and I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy. I'm fucking lost. Maybe its just quarantine? I know a lot of you will tell me to put myself out there, and I've already done that. Hell, I'm an active in three different clubs and in a fraternity with a ton of good guys.Just yesterday I jokingly said to myself that if I killed myself then my thoughts would stop going haywire, and only after a moment did I realize the severity of what I just said.

Every call\/org number that didn't pick up made me feel incrementally worse than when I had started out.I had thankfully physically exhausted myself, passed out and am now on a better place and state of mind to consider this more clearly.

I recently left Islam and keep worrying about how my life's gonna turn out, and how long I can keep up the lie. I hate living a life where I'm told to cover myself up and not talk to guys. I hate the fact that I'll have to get married whenever my parents want me to and \"obey\" my husband my whole life. I hate living in this misogynistic society. I keep questioning everything I've ever been taught and I feel like everything's just so fucked up. Women are so oppressed in Muslim societies, it fucking sucks. They're brainwashed since the very beginning to believe that covering up, obeying their parents and later their husbands will lead them to heaven. I feel like there's no escape.  I'm an American citizen but I live in India with my parents. I can't move out even though I'm 18 since I won't be able to support myself. I don't want to hurt my parents since they love me a lot.

Guy. 21 year old. I developed OCD this March. Thoughts about Covid-19 might have played a role. I don't have germophobia kind OCD (don't know if such a thing is there or the term for it). I mean I'm not getting thoughts that I will get the virus. I just get compulsive thoughts to wash my hands till elbow every time I touch any door or water taps, dishes from the kitchen sink and unwashed cloths. Hence I wash till elbow every time I touch any of these. I want to give this up and try my best to. The compulsive thoughts just keep coming back. My father humiliates me for this and many other things. Calls me things like \"good for nothing\", unfriendly, anti-social, psychopath and many other things.I'm not an introvert but I just can't do small talk like talking about what some celebrity likes, gossips, etc.. Been like this since I was 16. I'm a Bachelor's student. It's my final year. Till my 2nd year, I used to live in college. But I moved back home during the beginning of my 3rd year. My father brings this up always and tells how he knew I was an anti-social and how me coming home proved that. The real reason I moved back was because I couldn't concentrate well there. But he says I moved back because I cannot keep friendship with my room mates. Unlike US or other Western countries where 18+ people can move out, here we just can't afford the same. The jobs without good education will just not help us afford a living. And culturally too, we stay with parents till 22-24.He calls me a psycho. The worse thing is he himself is one, a narcissistic psycho and a religious bigot. He hates Christians and Muslims with a zealous passion. If you're aware what's going on in India, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's a huge religio-nationalistic ideology currently rising in India. It's called Hindutva. Our Government is also formed by a Hindu nationalistic party. It basically has the following: Hindus were subjugated by Muslims for nearly 1000 years( Invasions and rule of India by many Muslim kings and warlords ) and by Christians for nearly 200 years( Colonization by French, British, Portuegeese, etc. ). And now, India will become a non-Hindu nation because Muslims and Christians will overtake the Hindu population (Complete Nonsense). Hence it is a necessity to make India a Hindu nation from the Secular one it is now. He believes in this ideology. I'm a nationalist but I don't believe in this religio-nationalistic ideology. I left Hinduism 3 years back. Agnostic now. But my father has called me a traitor many a times because I no longer believe in anything of Hinduism.I have big dreams. I want to go to US\/Europe for a Masters and return to work in my country. I want to live away in a different city without the presence of my father and visit my mother twice every year till she lives. Once she's gone, I will never return home. But I don't think I will make it. I'm just unable to. Depressed. Half-dead. The only things stopping me is the thought of my mother. But that's too going away slowly.  I don't want to but I think I may take the step someday soon.","279":"Does anyone else feel life is just tiring. I have no reason to live, neither can I find one. I am a male from India (the country where \"smart\" people are manufactured).I am not sure if I deserve to live. Every day I get scolded upon by parents for not being perfect, no matter how much I try. First of all I live in this country where one exam decides everything in your life. My parents see people coming from poor backgrounds or sob stories getting top marks in the exam and they expect me to do the same. I am always compared to my relatives as they get good marks.I want to like my brother but I hate him, it is not that he has done anything to me, it is just that my parents allow him to do anything he wants because he is the backup plan. They want me to complete the dreams they never could.I am tired of this shit. Every fucking day have to keep up with getting scolded heavily just for saying that I want to eat later and other trivial things. I have no friends to share my problems to if I say something to my classmates they do not want to hear they all ignore me and insult me heavily. All my classmates think I am a hypocrite and attention seeker, just what should I do. Everyday we hear suicide cases and instead of wondering the cause my country blames the student for not being strong enough so maybe it is my fault. My parents keep saying that I am truly blessed to have supporting parents and if I talk to them about this they say I take stress on my own. I can not convince them to make me study abroad to escape from this country.So I don't have friends, a supportive family, a partner who will help me get through this or any hopes to escape from this desolate life. Why? Because according to the society it is my fault for not being perfect. As I hear the last tick-tocks of the clock my heart beat fades away as I hope to get an eternal sleep. How poetic and melancholic!P.S.- do not mind my english I dont speak english.","280":"i dont like it here anymore, im 16 and im a disappointment to my entire family, i struggle so much in school and my parents always call me a failure, ive lost all of my friends, my dog doesnt like me anymore and he constantly avoids me now. we have a plenty of money and i always hear \u201cyou have money why are u sad theres no reason to be\u201d and i always get shut down. my parents were hardworking immigrants that came from India and since i cant at least get good grades in school im viewed as useless.","281":"16f- I attempted suicide on the 29th of May.

This is going to be quite a long post and I've never really done anything like this before so please bear with me. Let me give you some context on my life.I was born in India with a quite decent middle-class family. When I was like 4, our family (me, my mom and my dad) moved abroad. He had a pretty good job there, and I was always a privileged kid. Ever since my childhood I got everything I asked for.  Had absolutely no troubles growing up, except the occasional fight between the parents, but that was minuscule and would get resolved in no time. All through kindergarten and grades 1-4, we stayed abroad. But my grandma was all alone back in India and so after completing grade 4, my dad decided it'd be best if he keep working there and me and my mom go back to India to live with Grandma.A few years after shifting to India, my dad got posted in another country so he had to leave his previous place and go work in that country, which was pretty close to the previous country. My dad was always this person who believed that he should keep working hard without taking any breaks so as to secure a good future for his family, especially my education and stuff, which I've always respected a lot. However, he was always so addicted to the concept of gathering and saving money that he would go to many lengths to ensure there's always money saved, which ended up in him quarreling with my mom and grandma many times. But again, it was still not a big deal and they would always come round to talking again. The main complaints we had were that he was not taking good care of his health and hardly spending any meaningful time with family, resulting in very few memories to cherish. Plus, my dad has always been a controlling figure, and he tries to literally control each of his family members' decisions by constantly nagging and throwing tantrums. But even this aspect was under control.Now, I was not always the brightest kid at school, and was always a little socially awkward and insecure as a kid, so when it came to my 9th and 10th standards, my grades had started declining and my parents (being Indians) would constantly nag me about it. I had this burning passion when I was in 10th that I wanted to be a music producer but since I'm Muslim and that's technically not permissible, my family did not acknowledge this at all. Slowly declining grades and constant nagging at home led me down a not-so-happy spiral, but I resorted to writing and ranting to my friends so it was cool.A pretty significant turning point came about in my 10th grade. For those of you who aren't accustomed to Indian education, there are basically two very important exams in your schooling years that basically \"shape your life\" as many state it (obviously not). Those are called \"board exams\" or simply \"boards\" and you give them at the end of 10th and 12th grades. So my board exams had just finished and we were in Mecca to perform a holy pilgrimage (hajj). My results were due and when they came out, they were actually decent but very low for my parents' expectations. I told my dad that I wanted to switch my stream from science to commerce but i'm always extremely intimidated by him so when he denied I didn't ask him further. The look on my parents' faces were always of disappointment and I felt worthless. I felt so worthless that one day I tried to overdose on sleeping pills and end my life. However, I had been quite dumb since the chemical composition of the sleeping pills we had at home was different than the one's I had read that would kill you.When we got back to India, the admission hustle for my 11th grade had begun and I was forced into a school and stream I didn't want to be a part of. Anyway, I thought this is a new beginning and tried to keep going despite my self worth falling completely apart. Also, during this period, my writing account  on Instagram had pretty depressing love-related poems and anecdotes, in which I used love as a metaphor and personified it to an extent. When my cousins shared screenshots of that account (which was private) with my mom, she asked me whether I'm in love. I said no, I'm heartbroken about other things, to which she never paid heed and said it's a phase and it'll pass (your usual brown parent undermining mental health talk). The constant nagging from my parents had now exponentially increased since they thought I'm lying about my mental health and I'm just \"distracted\". Anyway, I resorted to self-harm. There was this feeling of adrenaline and pleasure I'd get every time I would cut myself, just because I thought I deserved all this and I was the largest disappointment to my family. I told no one about this, until this girl I started seeing in 11th grade. Soon, she became my only way to vent and I always confided in her, but never opened up fully as I felt the monster in me would scare her away.Midway through 11th, my dad got into an accident and soon got sacked off his job, since there was a job crisis in that country. The man who had only known how to work and work (and not enjoy a life) was now left with nothing to do and nowhere to go. Plus, his health had started deteriorating from not caring for himself since decades. We called him back to India, and he went through a few checkups and that was the last time I ever saw my family happy together. My dad had been diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. And as you can probably guess, I haven't really felt entirely happy since then, and it's been a little more than 2 years. (okay now I'm gonna be quite brief since there are too many incidents to mention).So over the following months, I started regularly performing worse and worse in my classes, to the point where I was just barely passing. I used to be at school and\/or tuition for the maximum part of my day, so escapism is basically how I coped. At home, my dad would regularly fight with my mom and grandma, and keep crying over how his treatment's cost money and keep fighting over money and would spoil the whole mood whenever anyone would try to have the least bit of fun. On top of that, he would get physical with his own mother (my grandma), sometimes even choking her to the point that she'd get unconscious. Eventually, all this took a huge toll on my social life and I started abusing painkillers, in the process of which I even lost my girlfriend(I broke up cause I didn't want to spoil her life, she never knew about the painkillers and domestic abuse, no one knew\/knows).Somehow I passed 12th, and would stay out all day to keep myself away from home. I also picked up a smoking addiction on the way, even drank regularly at one point, but eventually left the painkiller addiction. Through the year that followed I attempted self harm multiple times. Fast forward to when I somehow managed to clear an entrance with flying colours and got into a really reputed business institution. It had taken a lot of convincing for my dad to agree to me switching to the commerce stream, and I originally wanted to switch to arts, but at the time everyone around me said that this institute was the best.Skip one more year in my institution, and my dad's cancer is gone, but he's genuinely gone insane. He talks about nothing but money all the time and keeps telling me how he's smart and everybody took advantage of him (no one did). We've tried therapy for him and he doesnt want to do it. And  as for me? Well, I have attempted and successfully almost overdosed on Serax pills. After this, I started telling myself - \"You only have to put up with this shit until you move out and you're financially independent\" and that's what kinda keeps me alive. Lockdown has beenbad because since I failed, my dad was the most depressed ive seen him and forced me to write a mail to my college using his situation as pity. Fights have been happening almost every day since 2 years, and sometimes it gets vv physical, and ive even pushed my dad away once. I've since grown to think that how can ONE man single-handedly destroy the life of ALL OF HIS CLOSEST family members in the space of 2 years. No one smiles in this house anymore and our daily drama is so funny now that it looks something straight out of a horror movie. I want to kill my dad and im worried that i will, one day in a fit of rage. Ive started losing sleep, started going super mad and getting bad anger fits and started ignoring my health completely and my new semester's about to start. i dont know how much patience i have left in me but i just wanna move out of this place so bad. so bad. i really dont know if its been worth living through this because these 2 years have left permanent mental damage on me and im lost and confused and i just want to move out man. so bad. i cannot survive here anymore.Sorry for getting too idiotic at the end, and thanks for hearing me out. there's a lot of stuff I was lazy to describe but you can ask me anything\/even rant to me if you're going through something similar in the comments. Bye and have a nice day xx","285":"Hi! I'm 16 and I'm from India. I have been practising self harm for about a year now. When I was 10 I was raped over and over again by my cousin. I was weak and couldn't fight back. Tho I tried to pretend nothing happened. A year ago, I gathered courage and told my parents what happened. To my surprise my father told me, FORGET ABOUT IT AS THEY HAVE A DIGNITY TO UPHOLD. Here's the thing, I have never had it good with my parents but I thought opening up about it would help. My parents told me not to speak of it anyone else. I'm bipolar, I was diagnosed a few months ago. I'm struggling with pills a lot. I overdosed once and it was hard getting back up. I still slit my wrist out of anger and stress. I have PTSD and parents that are violently abusive. I hate being called, \"YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ON THE BRINK OF SUICIDE\" my parents say so and laugh it off. I'm struggling with a lot of things and I hope I see better days soon :) Sorry about the rant- I just thought talking about it would help a little.","286":"I live in India with no working suicide helplines and no help from the police .

Thank god my neighbor stopped him, I called my mom's relatives for support but nobody cared about be who had bruises and was in pain, I was packing my dad's bag for him to leave the house because my mom was taking care of the so called relatives and everyone was gushing over me saying I have so much love for my dad that is why i was the one packing his bag!!! what the fuck!! I didn't have a choice I hate this situation.During college I trusted a guy and was in relationship with him, but he in turn started spreading rumors and shared my number with every random guy in college. I used to get calls from random guys asking me to sleep with them for money. When I was going through this harassment, my mom used to beat me saying it was my fault for getting those calls!!! I was 16!!! How could you say that it was my fault mom? I used to change my phone number and still used to get calls, later I found that my cousin was the one who was also sharing my number to random people.When I was crying my mom used say that I was doing it to make her look bad in front of everyone. I had 18 subjects as backlogs by the time I reached 6th semester. During 5th semester I met another guy (lets call him P) who said he did not trust the rumors and wanted to really know what I truly am. I was looking for someone to understand me and trusted him. P helped me get out of the mess I was and made sure that I cleared all my failed subjects and made sure I had a degree along with everyone.But here is the thing, P always asks me to send nudes, I hate doing that, I am not at all comfortable with it, but he makes me feel guilty about it and forces me to send them. P knows I hate it but still does it no matter how many times I say no he guilt trips me into sending them saying cannot you not do this for me? I hate my body I hate everything about myself because I look like my dad and she says that I behave like him in every aspect, because I am fat, because I have acne on my body and face and my mom would say that I am doing it attract someone because I wanted to get out of this poverty situation and leave everyone behind.After college I moved to a different city for job, those 4 years are the happiest I have ever been, i had the chance to cry how much ever I want to, I could eat what ever I want to, I could sit the way I want to, no judgement and no one to stop me. Now coming to last year, I was forced to quit my job, my mom was alone and she wants me to change come back home and search for a job here and was putting a lot of pressure on me. The funny thing is, my mom was so nice to me when I started working so I though okay let her be in peace after so many years and quit my job and go back home. Now she started saying that I was too arrogant to quit my job without thinking and she started saying that I cannot do anything and was too dumb to do anything. I cannot cry or yell or do anything. I wish I hadn't quit my job. Now in this mess P started ignoring me saying I always talk only about me and won't even care about him. I never told him what I went through. I don't know whom to talk to. I cannot tell my friends that I am a mess, I don't want anyone to take advantage of my messy state.Whenever I cut veggies for cooking all I want to take the same knife and slit my wrists or want to bang my head to the wall or pull my hair or scratch myself till that pain dominates the other feelings so that I can feel something else other than this feeling of suffocation. I am so done with life, but I'm too weak to die. I want to live a happy life. I want to get a job and run away from this shit and start fresh.Thank you for listening to me.Edit: English is not my first language so please excuse me for the grammar, and I wanted to change the title could not change it. So added it in the post itself. Also sorry for the post which is all over the place.&amp;#x200B;","288":"My grandma lives in India, and unfortunately she is blind and feeling suicidal in the last few days.

From the UK there arent any flights available wither.My dad said he would allow my mum to go but no one in the family likes her as her intentions are pure but the way she talks and is always incorrect and says stuff like this level of depression is not showing anything as my grandma is continuing to eat, not walking out of the house or acting psychotic.

Hi my name is \\[redacted\\] and i'm 13. I guess i'll make a more indepth story about my life than i have previously shared. You see, I have a small cutting issue, nothing major, just when i get mad or feel like I was shitty to everyone that day (often as my personality sucks) i take my knife and, just make a cut deep enough to bleed. Recently, while I was sleeping, my cutting knife fell from my pocket, and my parents saw and took it, unfortunately now all i have is my self defense knife which is so sharp im scared to cut with it but don't really think I'll have a choice. Recently my parents removed the lock from my door, I had promised i would commit suicide if they did, but they read my messages (something they PROMISED not to do) and took my pills (i had a backup) and rope (i wish i had a backup of this). I guess it makes me mad i can't focus, focus on anything, especially school work, and then when i get bad grades, I'm out with the knife, I expect too much from myself, and don't study because once again I can't focus. My parents also practically bully me for this, I am a Gujurati (indian) that lives in the US, and there in india studying is super competitive so i guess they brought that over. Also my brothers condition is getting worse (low functioning autism) and I just can't see him suffer with his inability to communicate, the worst part is I can't even help him. My parents also use my condition as a threat, as in recently i went to a psychiatrist and now that they have it on file so they can say they will take me to a ward if i don't comply with any of their instructions, I really am tired of living now, 4 attempts under my belt and I don't know how long i can endure it, please talk with me, i need someone desperatley","291":"This is me 16M if you are reading this dont bother commenting e i will be long gone by the time you read this , i will just write this and log myself out . so a bit about my life * my both parents are abusive , plus divorced and i live with my mom * she regularly tells me and my siblings how much of a bad kid i am and how i should not exist * my dad refused to pay for my school and all other expenses when i left him , we dont talk neither see each other* fine with me i hated my dad anyways , he used to hit me and called me his bad luck so i was fine with it* my 10th grade results just came back and i sucked at them , i did not even get the appropriate subject i opted for in class 11th* i suck at sports , online games , you name it and i suck at it* people are good at atleast something in their life but i am good at nothing * so its better if i end it all today , wrote my family a good long email and scheduled it to send them after 4 hours , talked to some friends , watched my 1st birthday video and checked some all photos out , also am crying while am writing this because i am an emotional person* i wanted to  end it with a gun but you cant buy one in india so its getting high on liquor and jumping off a building ,# see you all in  Valhalla if you read this thats enough but dont comment coz i will be long gone , i also donated all the crypto i had like 1 btc to robert ulbricht fund and some to khan academy youtube channel .

If I fail these exams, I failed my teachers, my parents, everyone. This makes me feel so fucking hollow. I wish I could just disappear so my parents wouldn't feel sad if I died.

I haven't scored even close to this in my life yet, even with my absolute fucking best I've only scored 81% at my fucking best. I don't think I can get good grades in these exams because for the life of me I just can't understand this absolute dog shit of a subject called maths, and it is somehow very important. Even though I'll take these exams next year, I can't understand anything. It'll be a waste of time really taking those exams. I don't think I'll be able to get a job in the future either.

I was always the golden boy in my family and skated through life on my intellect. Got into med school(India) and as soon as i joined i started facing some major existensial dread. I stopped going to college because i was too depressed and just wanted to sit at home because i was unsure medicine was my calling in life. I cleared my first year but after that completely stopped going to college because i became majorly suicidal. I always had a plan to start my own company and i met and partnered with some pretty successful people who had similar plans. During all this i lied to my parents because in my mind, all that mattered was the end result, that being the money that i could gain by any means necessary to get \"settled\". I justified the lies by thinking so. Mind you i am a very good liar. But i broke down last month( 4 years after i stopped going to college) and told my parents everything. This was after my first suicide attempt. After a lot of tears , my mom and i went back to college, and apparently they will let me go back.My mom is very disappointed in me but she puts on a smiling face and tells me that now i am free to become a good doctor. I guess i want to be one as well.But the nihilistic thoughts just wont leave me. I still dont find any reason for living.

So far none of them work. Do you know of any that works?","296":"HiI\u2019m a 37 year old male from Singapore. I\u2019ve always been a very timid and quiet person because My parents believed children should be seen and never heard and doles out punishments when I speak out of turn or cry. I believe i am a difficult person to love because even my own mother has a tough time showing her concern for me - whenever I\u2019m ill or in hospital, the first thing she does when she sees me is to berate me for ending up in a hospital. T every instance, I had to give in to the demands of my sister - I couldn\u2019t take up driving lessons because there\u2019s only one car in the family and my sister is the only person allowed to drive besides my dad; when my mum found out I applied to a local university she was furious because we only had enough money for her to send my sister overseas to Australia for an expensive education. My sneakers and watch can only be bought from thrift stores but my sister gets the latest most expensive types. I suppose I suffer from an inferior complex because of all this.I\u2019ve also been having issues at work (I work at a call centre dealing with customer enquirers and feedback) with regards to words and actions of a few individuals and have developed anxiety and depression as well as a fear of people in general.A new manager came in and started telling us we (the in-house teams) are too expensive to maintain and he is considering outsourcing our jobs altogether simply by virtue of our call\/email volume handled even though our customer surveys have always placed us above the third party vendors from teams based in India and the Philippines. This drove up my anxiety because I have bills to pay and can\u2019t lose this job.I\u2019m also having issues with the admin lady - I feel like she deliberately \u201cmisses\u201d, \u201cforgets\u201d or \u201ccan\u2019t download attachments\u201d whenever it comes to my administrative matters. For instance, my staff pass expired yet she held off sending on my renewal application for 7 months. What\u2019s worse is that she announced at a meeting that she will NOT open the office doors for anyone who misplaces or forgets their staff pass, even though we have no way of accessing the office without our passes unless someone else opens the doors.She has also repeatedly cancelled my leave applications, both current and from the previous year presumably because she misread the dates and cancelled them by accident, could not figure out how to download the doctor\u2019s letter for medical leave justification, or simply forgot why she rejected the leave application in the first place (and she yelled at me too when I asked if she remembered the reason for the rejection).She\u2019s also been copying all the bosses in whenever she finds shortcomings in my administrative matters but refuses to reply when I offered explanations that pay the blame squarely back at her. But she convinced the manager to issue a new directive that all administrative lapses lie solely with the staff and not her as we must also keep track and ensure that she does not make any mistake.Also, the new manager had taken to raising a complain I had from February and flashing it on screen at meeting after meeting all through to August reiterating the \u201ctemplate\u201d response I gave - it wasn\u2019t a template; I was trying not to say no to the customer and so offered alternatives even from our competitors in hopes of not offending his sensibilities, to no avail.For months, I\u2019ve had very vivid visions of various scenarios of my death - crossing a road made me visualise a car driving at high speed running me over, climbing up stairs made me see myself falling down them and lying bloodied on the ground. Even walking along a balcony makes me imagine jumping off them...So, yes I have been driven crazy at work, and my mother-in-law\u2019s passing was the final straw. I snapped and had to be hospitalised for drug overdose. I was away from work for 5 months and recently got back to office. Almost immediately I received emails from the admin lady complaining above my administrative lapses during my absence as no one made any leave application on my behalf even though I have informed the manager about this.So now, I\u2019m afraid of even seeing her. I either suck under the table or tremble when she walks pass. And I\u2019m so afraid of talking to people or even seeing them I hid under a blanket whenever my home door bell rings, and bury my handphone under pillows when they ring. When I visit the mall for a meal, I started hyperventilating and had to walk back outside cause the crowd frightens me. It\u2019s like my entire life is now revolving around avoid people.And since My return to work, I\u2019ve been having chest pains and difficulty breathing. I feel ill and scared and on some nights, really tempted to just empty all the bills in my mouth, shut my eyes and be done with this exhausting existence... now, with the coronavirus, the Hospitals are swarming with patients and I don\u2019t want to go to ER and trouble anyone further when the medical stuff have so much on their plate already. I really just want to hide at home and avoid everybody but I force myself to get to work to pay my bills. It feels so exhausting... please can anyone share if they have been in similar situations before? I really just want to dig a hole and bury myself but my partner needs me now.... he is 24 years older than I am and my secret plan has always been to either kill my self at his funeral (if he passes on) or, to kill myself when the relationship is over because everything I could possibly achieve in this lifetime has been done. I\u2019m already resigned to the fact that nothing else is ever going to happen to me, especially not the good, so it\u2019s time I go before I outstay my welcome...","297":"I come from India. The education system here is batshit crazy. Parents decide your career. Attending endless hours of college and tuition to score well in standardized exams.My parents from a very young age had pressurized me to top classes. (Topping means rank 1 and never 2nd. I know it sounds strange for anyone from a different country. But that's the way it is here.) I was raised as a perfectionist. I had no childhood AT ALL.It was so much that I developed acute OCD ad Social Anxiety. Even after diagnosis, my parents refuse to take it seriously. Until my results are out I keep on checking and rechecking and rechecking answers of past exam papers. After my results are out, my next exams are here. I live in constant fear and anxiety.I tried to learn guitar and get good at a sport. Also I long to travel. But I never have the time.I always keep fearing I'm not putting my all.All I do now is scroll through social media whenever I get a panic attack. I hate myself for it.I don't see my life going anywhere. I don't believe it will ever get better. We are all dreaming of some rose garden around the turn but there isn't any.Only the pain is too much.Thank you for reading.","298":"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years. My mom and I often take a journey (5 AM in the morning) by train of 3 hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. The doctor fixes the day for us to visit him. It causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in India. Not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line (in the hospital) just to see the psychiatrist. My mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. Instead she does it herself. You won't believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy (maybe because it's a famous hospital around here).When I visited him, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti-depressant named, BUPOZEN 150mg tablets. I have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for 3 years. My parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. They aren't even aware that this tablet is a anti-depressant. The doctor never tells us about it. Just expects us to believe him and take the doses daily. I never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.All these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them?Many times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.I even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist. Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24\/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.Now coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them.I think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants?I'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds.I'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? What do you guys think I should do?","299":"I have been struggling in lif. I am a horrible person. Made some financial mistakes putting everyone Life at risk. I just can't handle the pressure anymore. I tried a lot to make it better, but it's getting worse. being humiliated each moment, tormented for money I have become a laughing stock for everyone. Enough of this suffering for me. I don't even want this day to end. It will be a nightmare when I wake up tomorrow. Can someone suggest me a fool proof way to end it? I don't want to be half dead m I have done lots of research. Apparently shooting myself is the best and quick way. But in India gun is not an option.   Can you suggest something more plausible?","300":"Its been 5 days. Just 5 days since I had decided to end my existence on this earth. I had penned everything which a deeply broken heart and mind could think of [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/india\/comments\/f161mw\/serious_post_bye\/). After posting, I had logged out. Why?Because I was really not expecting anything in return. Because I knew it's too late for me. It really is. Passage of time is the only constant in this world. Time is a heartless bitch which really waits for no one. Not for a king, not for a beggar and certainly not for simpletons without any skills like me. I, to be brutally honest, perhaps have and had taken time for granted. Perhaps I did not value my precious time on this plane of existence. Please know that these words are not something I had written or am writing now,  lightly or something which is not reality. It is my very real miserable life. It is the real pathetic life of a 30 year old loser dumb fuck like me.  I was saved that day by a certain something. It was a phone call I had to pick up. Just to hear the other person's voice. Just to hear it one last time before I go.I couldn't let go. I couldn't. I feel it is not prudent to give the details here, of my deed to commit suicide. I do not want to encourage or give that little push to someone else who is suffering and who is at the end of a ledge.  So, now, here I am. My problems has not gone away. There is no magic to make them go away. It's just me. Imagine a person fallen deep in a dark pit and on its floor. He is already at his lowest. But now a hammer striking on his head. Going down even further. Deep into the pits. Pits of his own despair &amp; sorrow which seems to be never-ending.That's me.My post was perhaps subconsciously a cry for help. Many many kind folks here have put their thoughts on my post in their comments. I also, have got many DMs. I am going to read them now. I will try to grasp them and will try to muster some strength to reply.There are no words to express my gratitude to all of you who took the pain to read some pathetic failure's words like me, who is a stranger to you and then, you tried to stop me or give your honest advice to help me or try to solace me. Thank you. Your empathy &amp; your kindness will light up everyone's lives you touch directly or indirectly.I still don't know why I am here. Why I am still alive? Why it's not my right to take my life away? Away from the constant drudgery.I also knew that as time passes, I and my words would be erased from your memories and you would also forget that I, a stranger with all my problems ever existed. Time erases everything. Many have advised me to see a psychologist or psychiatrist. The reality is I was already seeing a psychiatrist and also psychologist - counsellor for last one year. I have poured my heart to them. After a certain difficult session where the psychologist refused to help me and told me that I have to be hospitalized, I was speechless. And I am having medications from the Psychiatrist Dr. for now, a year. Although he had assured me that this would have helped. But the sad truth is that it has not helped in anything substantial. My severe depression has not gone away. My reality has not gone away. My hand still shakes constantly because of my anxiety.In my last session with the psychiatrist, he told me that sometimes there are people who even after having prolonged medications, do not will to pick themselves up &amp; are lazy to go on a new path.I don't know if I fit into that description. I don't know why he said that to me. In my say, 15  to 20 mins meeting with him - each time I have tried to express my real thoughts, problems in a completely transparent way. Rushing through because I think 15 to 20 mins are not enough for a person in my situation to explain what is happening. I do not really know what to do now. I am a person who is aimless, who has no goals, has no particular skills to get a long term job and sustain his family for a long run.I am scared. It is a really do or die situation for me. Because I do not have much time left where I can freely take my time and choose a career path. I fear to even think of what would happen if my next step is wrong, should I decide to live. I do not have the strength in my mind to start learning something new. My memory has decreased drastically.When I sit to think upon and decide what should I do, what career should I choose.... it is like  suddenly a huge mountain comes and sits on my head - the weight of its burden bearing on me, pushing me deep into my own pit of misery even more further down.And no one to lend me a helping hand or a rope to climb up.","301":"I'm 18 I couldn't get in any college last year, tried again this year but chances look slim. I'm from India so I'm competing with a very large demographic. Father died last year and mom stays away from home due to work.

Everything seems dull. No friends to hangout with nor do I make the effort to keep the ones I have. I think I've reached my saturation.

I don't really care about taking a loan and finishing my studies as I'm a good student but the fact that my own parents would say something like that is heartbreaking. My mum always says there's a money crunch so on my birthday I got nothing. I've been wearing the same clothes for 4 years now.

I can't remember the last time I've been happy. In the past my anxiety was restricted to exams and social settings but I now I feel stressed and anxious 24\/7. I am not *exaggerating*.I literally can't sleep these days. It's just too much, all my peers are doing things moving on while 28 year old who has done nothing the past 2 years.

I had nowhere to go, no place safe and was helpless - and still am today. Below is a short recap of some key traumatic events in my life, I missed out on many. I haven't slept for the past 48 hours and the cycle of PTSD never ends making life so unbearable by the passing day. I haven't edited or checked grammar..I documented the best I could.]I don't understand why I just cannot get a break. Why is this (life) so hard? At every turn something goes wrong..and there seems to be no escaping it no matter how hard I try to maintain my ambitions, drive and sanity.Life begins.Move abroad to Ajman. Very modest means, family just scraping by. My health is poor - low RBC count, almost anaemic, constantly battling allergies and sinus\/middle-ear infections..Physical and verbal abuse begins. My health doesn't improve and I undergo surgery to have my adenoid and tonsils removed + had a grommet inserted into my eardrum. I was getting blamed for my illness - like as if it was a choice and they played the victim when I came to them with complaints (usually severe nasal congestion to the point I couldn't sleep at night - really affected my bedtime routine, ear pain, many instances of perforated ear drum which thankfully hasn't rendered me deaf!) They would also blame the occasional chocolate or ice-cream I had or my lifestyle habits for the allergies when I knew damn well the mould growing inside the air-conditioning ducts and on the bathroom walls were the primary culprit at home. In school, I would have a toilet problem. I would wet my pants because I was scared to use the toilet. Once I was forced to sit on the latrine to take a piss by one of the janitors there. Ever since, I was petrified of going to the toilet and ended up controlling my urine indefinitely until I peed myself. I would even go around the class, walking fastly hoping to curb the sensation..During the childhish physical fights my parents would have, I as this innocent boy I still was would scream at the top of my lungs for them to stop. I got beaten very badly all the time and my mom never cared enough to protect me. I would get objects hurled at me including kitchen utensils and D size batteries when I couldn't write my multiplication tables..Relocated a couple times. This time we land in Fujairah. Attended the local CBSE Indian school there. This is where the Arabs (locals) were hostile to us. We were foreigners on expatriate. A bunch of Arabs coordinated an attack on me just as I was leaving the bus. I knew what they were planning to do but was helpless as another senior who was apparently on their side had blocked me until everyone had left the bus so they could strike me one on one. The buses were gender segregated, so the girls sat in the front. They got off first. And the conductors had left the vehicle by then. They lifted me by the neck and bashed me around, I believe I bit the insides of my cheeks so hard that it was bleeding and perhaps a scar. Not sure of the full details but I was halfway certain that would be my end. I don't know if they just wanted to beat me up or inflict more bodily injury. When I told my parents about this and they penned a letter to the bus conductor, he invalidated my claims in a condescending manner perhaps accusing me of lying..Relocated to India for grade 6. This is where people started making fun of my name, including adults who would act like illiterates and pronounce my name intentionally wrong and ask me what kind of a name it was like I had the choice. I had lordosis and was made fun for it. I was able to correct it to an extent using good posturing + exercise and yoga. I didn't like doing my homework, a lot of times these problems were ambitious and required you to be socially involved. As this outcast I already was and being a sensitive introvert, I was left behind making matter worse for me. I just lost all interest in studies. I didnt do all my assignments especially math. I loved English and anything to do with creative work like essay writing or preparing booklets on a research topic with infographics and images or making charts and presentation. I simply hated cut-and-dry problem solving...After everything I still have to deal with insensitive family members who are just about the most sallow, materialistic, narrow-minded people who want to maintain control over others and constantly yell and bully when they can't understand your reasons for doing something.It would have been a great privilege to grieve\/process your negative experiences in peace. I was put under constant pressure even as I was wauyyy past breaking point.Why do people enjoy making me feel helpless? Besides the ongoing abuse at home, I was being bullied at school, by adults on the streets. Got my arm pulled on by a neighbor as I fought to free myself. Got beaten up for no reason once, got kicked in the groin again for no apparent reason, received a blow to my neck, a surprise beating on my back without verbal warning, got hit on the head for not reciting along or being able to memorize on cue, got my hair pulled and twisted for not walking in file. Got insulted because I was distracted in class having been in a vehicular accident previously that day. This was all just up until class 12. As I grew older, the nature of the abuse at home changed. It was now more verbal - threats about cutting me off financially, with the same old insults, etc. The physical + verbal abuse in school now changed into verbal. I had two roommates who didn't give a shit, kept me up all night and ignored my pleas like it didn't exist. They violated the roommate agreement and then played the victim saying that \"I must just concentrate and work\" without taking in their distractions. However, there was one physical intimidation in college where a student in my class walked up to me while I was leaving and grabbed my jacket still on the chair physically preventing me from leaving while he lectured me using my gadgets (in silent mode) in class when he wasn't the authority (professor) there. After all that saga played out, my dad started his usual drama and games. And I was eventually forced within weeks time to join another university at a course I didn't want. I eventually got out after alterations with the professors who kept picking on me because my Stoic demeanor irritates them I guess. In this education system they expect you to learn things at face value on cue, so you have a very small amount of time before they call you out and make you recite those things in a very exacting manner. During my stay there, I had yet another bad roommate who would smoke inside the room, throw matches and his stuff\/trash on my bet and mess up the place despite the rules stating otherwise. He would also turn the fans off\/lock the door to roll joints making it hard for me to gain access to my own room. I stayed at a number of cheap lodges during which time I came down with a terribly severe allergy that resulted in me sneezing uncontrollably. I couldn't eat or consume any liquids. I decided that it was enough and left university on my own terms, destroyed my ID card. I also got rid of all my school transcripts because I was scared that my parents will force me into another university and without these documents, I was a little safer. My parents never listened, they only started yelling and immediately accused me of being the problem forcing me to helplessly shut my mouth. I was afraid to say anything because I know they would react in the most emotionally unavailable way possible.When we came to India following doctors recommendation, my mom would play the victim saying how I was depriving her of a good life abroad and I was the reason for their (my mom and sis) suffering. She was just too materialistic and wanted the glam and polished life, visiting malls, taking photos everywhere and gossiping with her lady friends from the comfort of the air-conditioned apartment.While applying to university, I was forced to attend Penn state. I asked for a gap year as I'd gotten rejected by all the top universities I'd applied to. I wanted some time to process, perhaps retake the SAT and apply again for the next intake. I applied very late and was forced to come to India on the condition that I go out in the summer sun, I was miserably exhausted and stressed physically to deliver my transcripts. My dad agreed to let me come back to India (I guess I'd gone there for a few days after finishing school) but he then changed his promises like he always does and told me to stay there saying he wouldn't let me go back home. It was house arrest living in Muscat and his toxicity was unbearable. He would provoke me for no reason, come up to me when I'm quietly using the laptop and make fun of my appearance, make slippery slope arguments and insult me. These provocations and their associated emotions were so uncalled for and hard to predict for anyone with a rational mind.Almost everyone I've been involved with in my life has had a controlling and very subjectivist outlook on right\/wrong. They have also lacked ANY empathy  and have invalidated my suffering. They will impose their convictions on me and say I'm wrong for doing things my way at no one's expense.What have I done to deserve so much punishment from all sides? I'm already being pressured to become financially independent. It's like people will set you up for catastrophic failure and then play the victim when you falter and succumb to your suffering. Like, why does my internalised suffering bother these people? Can't one even suffer in peace? I haven't even asked to be cured, all I want is to bear the disease in peace.Anytime I bring up anything to my mom, she invalidated it and says it's trivial and that she'd been through much more and it's all nothing. My dad only know to raise his voice these days, before he would also physically intimidate and brutally abuse me.Everything is connected and leads into the next. People break and break and break me without remorse and then accuse me of being dependent on them or not tallying up to the achievements of others at the same age.I reached out to help here. My mom agreed but then dad played his games tried to convince me at first and then lied to my mom that I'd said \"no.\" My mom doesn't care about justice or fairness, she plays along to the loudest\/most domineering\/biggest asshole in the room to keep harmony without truly understanding who the perpetrators and victims involved are. I reached out to help on my own again locally (I have done many times before) while in crisis and the therapist, instead of even listening to me, started judging me and shaming me for being dependent on my father (I'm 21 y\/o). When I would say something like I wanted to learn music, she would discredit that like it had no value. When I told her I make electronic music so it would require no additional costs of buying instruments or equipment, she still stuck to her conviction that it would need an instrument. So narrow minded and judgemental and her approach was to shame me and say I was wrong and everybody around me was right. She produced no logic in her arguments. It was more like a debate with a highly disagreeable person with a rustic mindset and less like an open-ended therapy session. Her advice was \"why don't you go and get job training like everybody else\" basically comparing me with everybody else without giving me any concrete action plans or solutions to work with. It's experiences like this that make me not want to be vulnerable around anyone. I just want to suffer in silence without being forced to do anything that I don't like. When I told her that my parents would frequently threaten to not feed me, or say I was a mistake, her question was \"but did they do it?\" My family would always gang up against me, like if dad started physically engaging with me my mom would do nothing until I try to hit back when she will push me away. As a little boy, when I was crying miserably, I would get called a drama and ignored. My dad would literally threaten to kill me.In school I would get caught all the time. I wasn't harassing anyone, going around disrespecting teachers or anything.. but they got me in trouble by virtue of their intolerance. They would accuse me of something I didn't do or say and when I defended myself, they would snap back demanding that I don't be disrespectful. Hence I became labelled the problem child. The trouble maker when the real trouble makers were out there on the loose.People will treat you abnormally and then demand that you behave normally.My entire life has been a trauma. Never once have I felt safe, loved or wanted. Which leads me into a full-blown cognitive dissonance when someone like abroad acts nicely to me and I'm like, do I even deserve this? I think I'm also becoming a masochist and putting myself in painful situations because suffering has always been the norm and going against it feels almost a little unnerving.The unpredictability of my parent's emotions is also a cause of anxiety while dealing with them since I'm still dependent on them.The thing is nobody wants to listen to me. Even when I reach out after so much deliberation and when I have failed to handle it, they run over it quickly. Nobody listens or seems to have the patience to even lend a ear to a bleeding heart. Is this truly how twisted the world is? I was afraid to speak or complain about what people were doing to me to anyone because they'd ridicule me or shame me for it and scold me further.","305":" Reddit:[u\/Drblackcobra](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Drblackcobra\/) chat,message me,whatever..Discord:Cobra#2289A personal postHey guys...it\u2019s me\u2026.[u\/Drblackcobra](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Drblackcobra\/).You know that guy from the [r\/gaming](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/gaming\/) subreddit talking about my room and playing death stranding and stuff.This post is after the review that I made for Death Stranding.I uh need to say some stuff about myself.I know this post will be weird and annoying to some and won\u2019t even get noticed,it will be very long,but...here goes.I consider myself to be a personal...failure.Yeah, I know,we started out weird.When I was playing death stranding,I personally felt bad for myself because kojima made a game..and I can barely even go to my laptop and start practicing coding.I think I was born in a way where I would be designed to fail and I personally accept that fate.I\u2019ve been thinking about my home and school life now,I think everyone else is ahead of me.I do have a loving family,don\u2019t get me wrong,but I feel like I\u2019m a messup.

Same apologies to those guys.I\u2019m wanting to become a game developer,art,programmer,animator...but I feel like they're all pipe dreams.I\u2019m a loser who can\u2019t even make his own top notch game. I\u2019ve never gained any progress on my goals and I can\u2019t even make myself be like one of the greats. I\u2019ve tried to practice and even tried to do courses but I managed to not even improve the slightest or even do anything about it. I mostly saw everyone\u2019s art at my local comic con and it\u2019s so much better than mine.I\u2019m considering giving up.My carreer doesn\u2019t seem to be a good choice.How am I helping soociety,I should become a doctor like my sister and Idk what to do.I feel like I should probably just switch carreers because I\u2019m not truly helping people or saving lives by making stupid video games.I\u2019m an idiot for even trying to do that path.Heck,even with the militaary,I\u2019m a 14 year old skinny dude who can barely do exercise how am I going to become a marine?I\u2019m literally a toothpick bro.What\u2019s the point of joining,how am I ever going to get stroong and end the teasing?11\/18\/19:Currently seeing everyone else having a good time in support monday,if you have an A in a core class(science,math,reading,history) you get to have free time or study.I\u2019m seeing everyone else at the library having fun and stuff.Now it\u2019s time for me to go. (8:55 AM)11\/18\/19(9:03 AM):Ok let\u2019s move on.I have more things to u\/\u2019s really frustrating to see people whose personalities are not weird and annoying and more chill and cool.I don\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t make friends in the first placu\/because of the curse of my habit of making friends,or is it something else?Unfortunately,I might never find out.I don\u2019t know how long I can keep up this.There might be a point where the fuel runs out,its game over.I can\u2019t even make game developer,aritst,or animator friends.Most of them aren\u2019t good enough for me,they feel like I\u2019m a weird person and just go,showing my idiotic personality.Heck,even after I finish this post,no one will even CARE to be friends with me.I think my time has come in this world,its time to make it as best as possible.Idk what else to say\u2026.High school\u2019s probably going to be 10x worse without anything to do,I\u2019m hopefully trying to atleast do some work. My grades are eh,I\u2019ve never gotten a true As because I\u2019m an idiot and never put in the work. Atleast,my dad said that I\u2019ll never get the feeling of all As because I\u2019ve never achieved them.Heck,I\u2019m not a smart kid at all.Everyone else is ahead of me and here I am makig As and Bs and I might even not do so well on my SAT and ACT.I\u2019m also a absolute dumb person who can\u2019t eveen do simple tasks.I\u2019ve been remembering how my dad used to scold me for getting instructions wrong and that\u2019s my fault because I\u2019m an idiot.Moreover,thanks to my dumb mind I almost failed 3rd grade and my dad and mom had to beg the principal for letitng me stay in.If I was smart,I\u2019d been ahead,learning more,but I\u2019m an idiot.(9:40 AM,11\/18\/19).(10:00,11\/18\/19):Again,I\u2019m an idiotic dude who could\u2019ve been smarter if I was bron hte right way istead of torturing my parents by making them give gifts to the teachers and their children,all because of me.I think that\u2019s it.I might make another doc detailing some other frustrations but for now I think this is it.If you want to contact me,see the contact info at the top.Anyway,cobra out! :(","306":"Human misery had been permanent  ever since the invention of society. Maybe not nearby, but somewhere, there is always a large group suffering to provide richer people with comforts. I constantly think of abused factory workers in India, children starving in some remote African village,  prisoners in China peeling garlic for hours straight. I have a cushy life in America and hate it. Hate living and hate this dense fog of depression dulling life. That coupled with the inability to ignore terrible global suffering has fueled two suicide attempts  and will fuel my third. I view human society as something not worth living in and impossible to perfect. At least I can keep attempted suicide until I finally escape this world.Similar views? Antagonistic ones?","307":"(Tried posting it on r\/needadvice but I can't post anything realted to suicide there, so reposting it on here)Tl;dr at bottomHey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y\/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had \"rotten my brain\"). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like \"Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me\" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)TL;DR: I am a 14 y\/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that)&amp;#x200B;Update: So while talking normally, I asked my dad what he would say if I asked him I wanted to see a therapist. He reminded me that I had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in India, it wouldn't do me much good. Also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (And it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since I do not have a psychological problem like depression, I can just meditate and go for walks and I'll be okay. The funny thing is, I was amused when he said that I don't have depression lol (Hopefully it didn't show up on my face)Also, I talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when I told him about my cuts. He said that he had a long and tiring day and when I told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (Which is his kind of go-to emotion. Mine is laughing). I know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason I can get behind. He also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which I won't be doing","308":" Hi.It all started back in high school. I had some previous experiences from elementary school where I was bullied for being the odd one out, but that wasn't my main concern at that point. It was very hard for me to become a part of the social activities during that time. I have always been the kind of person that spends a lot of time on his own, and maybe also too much time in front of my pc where I was trying my hardest to become a professional gamer. I was number 280 out of 3.7 million players and since everything else around me wasn't working very well I used the gaming partially trying to go pro but also partially escaping reality. I knew I didn't have a lot of friends at school, when we were socializing, to me it felt like the only way you could do that was through drinking alcoholic beverages (high school).\u00a0 I didn't want to drink my self due to problems at home where my father was\/is drinking a lot of times at the week and his brother was an alcoholic. So when people asked me why I didn't drink I just said \"I don't want to\" - The immediate response was \"Well you can't say that you don't want to do something if you haven't tried it out yet\" So when I attended parties with this attitude and knew that people wouldn't understand how I felt and at the same time I didn't have fun in the party environment and it was almost like it was the only way to socialize amongst the other students. I didn't really like it that way. So I kind of isolated my self from the rest of the class. We would talk during classes and breaks, but never after school. As time had passed I felt like the lack of common interests hurt my \"standing\" in the class. People would often talk down to me and find it funny to hide my stuff since they knew that I hated when other took my stuff and it gave them a reaction. In addition I have always been that odd one out as I wrote earlier, I've never had the best social skills. Because of\u00a0 some of the boys particularly my \"friends\" would start calling me autistic, weird and other stuff.\u00a0 Especially one guy kept going at me, I've always been somewhat bright in school, got good grades and so on, but been awful with my hands (I can barely even tie knot on a plastic bag) so he started saying that I sucked at everything else than school and so on.Later I finished High School and took what we in Denmark call a \"Sabbat \u00c5r\" which is basicly one year off where you are supposed to find out what you're gonna do after (attend university etc.) I had two jobs during that time. One of them was doing some warehouse work. Here I could really feel that I was the weak link. We were eight people working at the warehouse and they were all living in our small town of 2.000 inhabitants. We had like different work stations where you had to do different stuff, I really felt like I was a burden at all times. It was hard for me to do the simplest of things with my hands and people looked at me as if there was something wrong with me. It was so embarrasing. All I could ever think about during those two months I worked at the warehouse was that the other people probably talked behind my back when I wasn't working there about how clueless and worthless I was... It wasn't something new for me though I knew that I have always been bad with my hands. When I was six years old in elementary school I was told by the teachers that I had to do exercises with other pupils from the school who struggled with the same problems as me - we were probably like five people there out of 400-500. Meanwhile at school I was the best pupil at math, I already knew how to multiply, divide and take the square root of something when I was six. I finished all our math books during one class and I started to get books that was supposed to be done by pupils who were three-four years older than me. What I quickly acknowledged however was, that it was only mental arithmetics that I was good at in math. When things got more advanced or complicated so to say with graphs and differentiation and integral calculus things started to get harder, because now I couldn't just calculate it in my head, now I actually had to problem solve more... It made me realize that I not only sucked at using my hands but also the things I thought I was excelling at.So now I knew that I was for sure only good at one thing, and that was video gaming. I was constantly playing with my professionals, I met them all the time and could often beat them. I had high hopes for a professional gaming career, I just had to improve and become even better. Sounds easy right? Not at all. It was hard as heck, I have played the game for eight years, and probably played around 1000-1500 hours each year. I wanted this to work so much it felt like it was my only opportunity to actually accomplish anything in my life. I felt as if this was the only way I could actually prove that I would for once, actually be useful at something or at least just be so good at something that I could make a living off it. So while I had my year off I started grinding hard. Now was my time to show I was exceptionally good at this and to hopefully join a professional team and become an E-sports\u00a0athlete. But no it was not, Throughout the year I quickly learned that while I indeed was good at the game, I would probably never have the abilities to become professional at this game. In the meanwhile while this was going on - in the back off my head I was starting to get worse thoughts. My thoughts from High School where people told me I was useless and autistic and so on. I started to feel like all of this for sure was true. I was starting to panick and the thoughts kept getting worse and worse. I was starting to feel like the only way I could actually become useful was if I ended my life. My parents worried about\u00a0 me all the time, asking if there was something wrong. I really wanted to talk about this with them, but I couldn't. I have always been really bad at talking about my problems to someone in real life. It's super difficult to me.\u00a0 So them worrying about me and me feeling useless just kept making me feel worse and worse.\u00a0I was starting to think about suicide maybe half of the days of the week. I would be up at night thinking about my life situation and thinking how pathethic I was. I knew that a lot of people had it a lot worse than me, how could I ever feel this way ? I was privileged, I had loving parents I had an early good childhood with good friends it was only later on in elementary school I would start getting bullied. How could I ever think this way? I started thinking about how some people in other countries struggled just getting their daily meals and how disgusting it was off me to even have the thoughts when all the conditions around me were so much better than say the conditions in coutries like Africa or India etc. This made me hate my self. How dare I feel sorry for my self, when it was mostly my fault ? I Could've just socialized with others no one forced me to take any of the decisions I did, It is my life and my choices that define my life so how could I ever complain about how it was, when all the decision I've made have led me to where I stand now? \"How am I ever gonna a girlfriend or someone to love me, if\u00a0 I can't even love my self?\" - and am I gonna die alone because of this? I am not even that attractive in real life, and I don't have a lot of confidence in my self, so how in the hell am I ever gonna approach a girl and tell her that I love her? I was just thinking I am gonna die like a loner and gonna spend the rest of my life wishing that I had just done it, just killed my self instead of suffering my self and making everyone suffer around me due to being worried about me. Again I started thinking: \"Is it even worth living?\" \"Would the world be a better place if I wasn't here?\" \"Would my parents have less to speculate about, and would they have an easier life if I took my own life?\" Thoughts like this led me to next period of my life.My year off was over.\u00a0 \"We want the best for you S\u00f8ren (my name), and we think you should do something with your life, go study at a university like your sister, do something with your life instead of spending all of your time in front of the computer\", my parents told me. So I did. I applied for a University near me where I would study Business Economics. I was like \" this for sure sounds like something for me, maybe I can later work at a bank or at an insurance company or something along those lines\" So I started there about 2 months ago. I liked it to begin with, after all it was all so new\u00a0 \u00a0it was a new experience, new people around me and so on. The first days with the other students seemed so awesome we could talk about the stock market we could talk about movies all kinds of stuff. I really made some friends I thought \"people actually like me!\" Then the studies started for real. The classes became a part of my every day life and the super exciting subjects I thought they were to begin with ended out being \"oh, I guess im going to the lecture today, how exciting...\" I still talked with the other students and we had a somewhat good time together. Thing is just the same problem occured again. They started socializing with each other after school while I was home playing computer, they went to parties went drinking and so on, all the activities that the university had planned for us was centered around one thing, alcohol. Keep in mind that every time I just thought about alcohol I thought about drinking problems at home, my uncle being an alcoholic and ruining his life and so on, so I just couldn't attend those things. How weird would it be for me to spend 30 dollars on a barcrawl to go drink at different pubs, If I don't drink at all?\u00a0All this culminated into one feeling. \"I can't do this study anymore\" - \"It doesnt even interest me that much\" Half of my subjects were pure maths and it\u00a0 wasn't math that I enjoyed, it was the kind of math I actually was only mediocre at. For some reason I always want to be the best at something so when I am mediocre at something or have difficulty understanding something, I just quickly give up. I stop doing the homework, stop reading, looking at the exit door during the lectures and just wait to get home... My suicidal thoughts kept getting worse and worse and I felt as if my world was about to break down. I didn't know what I was gonna do. \"Am I gonna tell my parents about study not being interesting\" - \"Am I gonna tell them that I am considering dropping out?\" \"What am I gonna do?\" Again I started to plan out in\u00a0 my head how I could end my life, I was thinking about how I took the train every morning and every time I was going home from uni. Maybe I could just throw my self out at the train and die? Maybe I could find a gun and kill my self? Maybe I could take a lot of pills hoping I would never wake up? I couldn't handle all of this I just wanted my life to end, I hate everything about it. I thought I was one big failure, I wished that I was never born, hated my self more than anything hated my self for being who I was and feeling sorry for my self, feeling that it was other people's fault and not my own. I just knew that the only way I could keep these thoughts at bay was playing video games. It helped me, I could actually socialize here actually feel like I was being appreciated, actually feel like someone looked up to me and thought I finally was good at something just something.So two months after my study had begun I decided that I finally couldn't live with it anymore. I had to tell my parents. I wrote a text message to my father about my study and said I was in the bus waiting to go home. He told me that we were gonna talk about things when we got home. When I finally arrived and told them everything I started crying louder than I can ever remember. I said: \" I am sorry for being such a failure, sorry for dropping out without barely giving it a chance\" They told me it was alright, but that I of course had to find something else to do with my life. They were after all worried about me, they only wanted the best for me. They were talking about a lot of different stuff that I could do talking about if I needed help from a psychologist. The only thing I could reply was \"I don't know, I dont know what I want to do with me life\" I wanted to say, \"How do I know what I want to do with my life, If I don't even know if I want my life in the first place\" but I couldn't say those words out loud. I knew I couldn't. I could see they were sad and they were extremely worried as loving parents are. It touched me I knew that they loved me before this and I knew they always have, but seeing them like this was like having a knife stabbed into my heart. I knew that I was the reason why they felt like they were.\u00a0The next morning we talked about stuff more in depth talked about what we were going to do and so on. I could see on both of my parents that they had slept very poorly and that it had affected them during the day. I knew that I was the cause behind this. It made me sure that everything just would be easier if I actually ended everything. I wanted to start and plan how I was going to end my life, but I was going to give it\u00a0 one last shot before I did so. This leads me to where I am now, typing this message.My parents don't know that I have these thoughts I can't talk about them at all irl...  my parents asked me if I wanted to go to a psychologist because my dad had cancer about one year ago.  For some time I totally forgot about my self and concentrated more about my father and the circumstances he was living under.\u00a0 I wanted to be there and support him the best way possible but it was very rough for me to cope with such difficult circumstances, it was hard to talk about and hard to ask into. After my dad's cancer had gone away the thoughts came back and I asked if it maybe was possible to see a psychologist since I had some problems I wanted to talk about. My parents immediately thought it was because of my dad's cancer and that I needed to talk about it and the whole process. In reality I wanted to go to a psychologist because of my suicidal thoughts, but I didn't want to share that with them. They asked if I wanted to talk about the cancer or if I wanted to to do it with a psychologist. Then I just said that \"I'm fine, don't worry about it\".It's hard to explain but I find it so much harder to talk about those problems, rather than actually writing about them.\u00a0 I'm not sure if I would be able to actually go see a psychologist and open up about my problems since this has always been so difficult to me. I really want to get some help, but at the same time I really don't want my parents to worry even more about me. After I dropped out of my study at university they were constantly asking if something was wrong, and that they understood that it could be hard to find out what kind of job you wanted to have for the rest of your life \"a lot of people change\u00a0 jobs multiple times and never stop, it is very difficult to find the perfect job or the perfect road to take with your very first attempt\" I agree and I completely understand that, I am just afraid that I won't be able to do a job at a satisfying enough level, maybe due to my incapabality of working with my hands or something else.\u00a0 I am very perfectionistic about my stuff and if something really interests me I can spend hours upon hours on that thing, I know that for sure. For example I started taking interest in chess a while ago I looked up every opening strategy what kind of counter moves there were and what kind of combinations you would be most likely to face and such. During one month I improved a lot just by watching video guides on Youtube and started really enjoying the game. I had the same thing with math when I was younger I loved doing maths I loved solving problems and the feeling when I finally solved something that I wasn't able to do before was just amazing.\u00a0 That is just one of the problems I feel like. Like if I want to have a job I don't want to be one of the worst employees, I want to be the best and if I can't be then I get so demotivated and I just stop trying.\u00a0This is not the first time I told someone that I had suicidal thoughts however. I have some online friends I've told they were very understanding as well and it helped for some time to talk with someone about it. Problem is just that it for some reason always comes back. I can have periods where I am really happy and never have negative thoughts, but then\u00a0 I can also have some periods where those thoughts can be almost unbearable and constant. For me at least it always seem to occour during holidays, birthdays family parties etc. This is where I feel the absolute worst and where those feelings can make me almost unable to breath it seems like. I don't know how to express it in an obvious way, but no matter how many times I battle my inner demons they always seem to come back and stronger. It can take one week, it can take a month it can take several months but those negative thoughts are always coming back and making me think about suicide.\u00a0 I'm not sure what to write at this point in time, right now it feels like I'm typing just to get this thing off my chest (weird how that works). Life is moving on and friends and people I know too, but somehow it feels like I am not. I'm not sure how put this... At the moment life just feels kind of pointless, I am so unsure what to do, after I dropped out of college and stuff. I really want to go find a job, but I honestly do not care about the money, it would just be a way to spend my time and keep the negative thoughts at bay.\u00a0 It feels like my life is so meaningless at the moment and I feel like a burden to my parents and everyone around me.I am 20 years old, my older sister is 22. I am still living at home while my older sister is living by herself. I feel a lot less indenpendent than everyone else at my age. Feels like I am just clueless at handling situations that normal people solve easily.\u00a0 I just can't get rid of the thought that life for people around me, would be better if I wasn't there. Family keep speculating about me... Right now my mom and dad are on vacation for two weeks in Thailand, while I'm home alone. Every day they are typing to make sure that everything is alright... I feel like a child and not an adult. I'm not sure how to explain it in the correct way - everyone around me seem so sure about what they want to do with their lives. It feels like I'm the only one struggling - life just seems so meaningless if I got a job the only point of it, would be to just do something. Same goes for college etc. I just can't seem to focus on a thing because it seems so pointless to me. I can't enjoy life at all and adding the fact that I feel like a burden... Every day that goes by, these exact thoughts crosses my mind. I just want them to stop? Why can't I just be a normal guy? Why do I have to be so abnormal and not fit in...I'm at the point where I am not sure if getting help is even worth it anymore. I just want to stop the speculation. It helps when I talk with my online friends whom I play games with and voice chat with every now and then. We joke a lot about stuff and sometimes I even joke about my situation without them knowing. I jokingly say that life sometimes makes you want to pull a gun at your own head and stuff like that. The response I've been met with has been different from time to time. The majority of them think that people who say they're suicidal only say so, to get attention. They just want people to care for them. It seems like it is impossible for me to say in a serious way that I am actually struggling with such thoughts, when they've expressed how they really feel about people stepping forward with such thoughts...\u00a0 I feel like I'm running out of options and that maybe, just maybe I should pull the trigger. But I am not even capable of something like that... I honestly don't know what to do. It feels like every day, I'm suffering a bit. Every day a fragment of my soul and a part of my lust for living disappears.\u00a0The only thing I can find meaning in is Esports (Electronic sports). Nowadays it seems like the only thing that can keep my interest. The times I don't think about suicide is either when I sleep or play\/watch Esports. Maybe I should just pursue a career in Esports? I'm not even sure how to do so or if it would even help ?Thank you to everyone who has sat through and read it.   I am sorry for punctuation and so on, don't really feel like reading through all of this, just makes me more sad thinking about it again and I am from Denmark so it is my second language. Not sure what to do at this point... I contacted the Danish suicidal hotline and hoped that it would be of any help. The girl on the line I was talking tried to sound like she really cared and all but five minutes before the line ended she wasn't even very interested in talking any further but just wanted to send me to another place and told me to go to psychologists and so on even though I feel like I can't...If you guys want I can post whole conversation between me and her later...Again thanks for listening... I appreciate every piece of advice I can get. Right now life feels almost unbearable.","309":"**11.25.19 20:14**Today is the first day that I\u2019ve genuinely thought about killing myself. I seem to have no future and I\u2019m worried about where I\u2019m going. My parents have such high expectations of me and I don\u2019t think I can do it. They always say I\u2019m smart and so do my teachers and other people. But I just know basics and enough to get by. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m actually smart. I know for a fact that I don\u2019t have their work ethic. They\u2019re immigrants who came from India and eventually worked their way to their current tech jobs with Apple and Google. I have everything material wise I could ask for and I\u2019m forever grateful for what they\u2019ve done for me. But they expect me to be better than what they are today and I\u2019m not sure how to do it. My grades are about B+ to C-, with a D in a Spanish class and I do nothing outside of school and have no to very little social life. I just feel like killing myself would be better for everyone rather than having to deal with me. I don\u2019t want to see my parents look down at me because I couldn\u2019t meet their expectations. It\u2019s just really bad right now.","310":"I'm 18 year old immigrant to the united states. I moved here from India with family, which includes parents and a brother, when I was 17. My mother used to love and take care of me a lot in India. She was the only person i loved and had in my life but I was still grateful that I had her at least. But then ever since we moved here, she now doesn't even talk to me forget about caring or loving. She'll walk in the room talk to my brother give him money, so that he could fulfill his 'needs' more like luxuries and won't even look at me. We are living in a small 2 bedroom apartment so it's not like I even have personal space. I loved her with all my heart, therefore, my heart is completely shattered. I always disliked my dad, as he is the worst gender biased person ever. Give all money, freedom, and luxuries to son (my brother) and don't let me step out the house or wear any full length piece of clothing without first answering a hundred questions and then listening to their 'taunts' before and after. Which is why I have no friends or anyone else. He plus my grandparents were like that in India too, but I had the strength to face that because my mother was by my side, or I thought so. But ever since coming here, because my father literally sits home all day and we are living in an environment where women have a voice and wear and do whatever they want, thus, he has increased his restrictions and the force to suppress me by asking more questions, yelling, cursing and verbally abusing at the top of his voice while my mother stands there and watches the show. I've tried talking to my mother a million times since the past year. I cried my heart out to her, expressed that I love her, begged her to care for me and that i'll be fine with fake care too just act. I've straight said these same things on her face honestly like every 2-3 days for an year, so much so, that i've cried and have streams of tears running down my face every single time. But there was not one instance that moved her. I go to a community college which is mentally stressing me out, I started working and have a trash body which physically makes me exhausted, and I come 'home' and this takes an emotional toll, dragging the soul out of me. Additionally, I've tried talking to my brother about this about 10 times too, but he sexually abused and did things i did not consent him off 3 of the times and other times didn't even care enough to say word, just nodded. So now i'm scared to even lay on the same bed after the lights are off, leaving only the living room couch as the place to sleep for me. I have no idea what to do. My only way out MIGHT be by transferring to a far off university, but who is going to pay for the fees and living expense? and i'll probably have to go through hell to first even tell that i want to move out. Then, I can not transfer to university for the next at the very least 2 years anyway. So i'm stuck here for the next 2 years. But I don't think I have the strength to see this for even the next 2 days. Being an Aquarius and a feminist, freedom and independence are really important to me, thus my environment is suffocating me. I do not know what to do, and how to make this situation better. I love my mother, but my mind hates her because of the things and way she's been treating me since the past year, but i still can not let go of the love. It hurts more everyday, as I cry and explain her that it is hurting me and she does literally nothing. There have been 3-4 times when I told her while walking out the house that she won't see me again as i'm going to attempt suicide, and I didn't see even the slightest change in expression, let alone any concern. I'm too much of a coward to attempt suicide, even though i honestly have tried to. So i can't die either. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I know dying is the best and my only option but i haven't been able to do that either.","311":"I'm usually depressed, at best apathetic, but occasionally I can get seriously anxious.  Bad anxious; I'm not always suicidal when I'm depressed, but I will ALWAYS want to hurt myself when I get anxious. And it's worse, because when I'm depressed thoughts of my family can anchor me, but when I'm freaking out, I'm like a dumb animal and I'm not thinking of anything but getting OUT.  Sometimes, I'm anxious because I start thinking about my work, how everyone thinks I suck, and I am not learning anything fast enough in my studies and will fail at the deadline.    But other times, like right now, I'm thinking of big things. Mainly, about how finite EVERYTHING is. FINITE. I'm running out of time. I'm running out of money. I'm running out of space, because the population is growing too big and my country's in a housing crisis. I'll never get a house, or land. Not that I deserve it. Don't want to clear more bushland to make more houses and push out all the endangered species we have. I'm running out of water; my country is in a drought. Water restrictions. I work in a hospital. We use so much water. We need to use it. I used to work in a restaurant. SO MUCH WATER. So much waste. Food. Plastic. God, the amount of plastic we toss in hospital. Syringes, catheters, test tubes, fluid bags... we can't reuse that shit. Obviously. Needs to be sterile, aseptic. But the landfills are overflowing.  But water freaks me out the most. Water is life for EVERYTHING. Look, just my state, not even my fucking country, has 220 hospitals. JUST hospitals. Not even counting smaller clinics, elderly homes, animal hospitals, or shelters, or wildlife centres. What other businesses use a shit tonne of water? Hospitality. SO much more hospitality than hospitals. Construction jobs. LMFAO car washes are still going strong. 135 major dams, and many of them are at 'low' levels.   If I leave my country, there's no point ecause the whole fucking world is running out. South Africa had that huge drought. They were saying hospitals and animal shelter were at risk. HOSPITALS. India is in drought, too; late monsoon season. Also, I just read in an article India is overflowing with rubbish, and then they have this smog problem. Oh my fucking god cars. The roads are so congested, so many cars. I can taste the fucking smog. I drive for miles without seeing more than a dozen trees. We're running out of trees, and O2 and the planet is getting hotter and the water is evaporating and we're all going to slowly die before the sun even gets a chance to explode. Petrol and gas, we're gonna run out of that. And all the species that are going extinct because we need to keep taking, because all our fucking resources are finite and we need to keep taking them to keep living to keep fucking to keep making more of us. Poor fucking animals trying just to live simply and we keep going and going and going and we're taking them down with us.     I just took my first shower in two days, and I counted 3 minutes but they felt so much fucking longer. It was like I was washing my body in gold or something, like this is too precious to be wasted. I felt sick. I still feel sick. I want to throw out all my shit and then never buy anything again, a clean slate so I never again waste and add to the landfills ever again.   I want to move to the ocean so I can SEE that the water is still there. Salt water is better than no water. Right?    I want nuclear power, fucking stupid I know, but that shit DOES NOT RUN OUT. Also solar power I guess but why doesn't that feel secure to me? I don't know. We're definitely not running out of sunlight. Until the sun explodes, but like I said, we're all fucking dead way before then. I think someone said we have like 50 years before shit starts getting real dire? But I can already see the signs. And they fucking terrify me.   I've gone to bed and gotten back up twice now. I don't like this. I know how obnoxious and stupid and dramatic I'm being and I hate it. But I want to die before everything goes to hell. Like, the end is just around the corner and I'm about to be trapped in humanity's final garbage fire. I'm human. Everything is running out EVERYTHING. Before the water runs out. I want to jump off a bridge, into the ocean, and die. I want the fish to have a decent meal and there's nothing left so I'm not taking up space in a grave.  Sorry. I know. Gonna take a valium I guess.","312":"Thanks","313":"My future looks sorta bleak now. I won\u2019t delve into details, but with the current immigration system, I\u2019m not a citizen of even a permanent resident even though I lived here 14 out of the 15 years of my life. I only remember the US as my home. Anyway, in my current situation college is going to be vastly more expensive. Since I\u2019m an international student. My parents are relatively wealthy, and they\u2019re the type of parents to help, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help me through.  But what I\u2019m truly scared of is next. I have to find a job as soon as I\u2019m done with college. Within a year. If I don\u2019t, then I have to self-deport myself back to India. Even if I do find a job, there is a going to be less than a third of a chance of me getting that job. Then if I do happen to get a job, I will be stuck in the same cycle my parents were. Except for the fact that it\u2019s going to be way way worse in a decade. My parents would have to wait about 20 years in total to become residents. I have to wait more than a century, unless some serious reforms happen. So my only chance at being a resident of this country is to marry a citizen.  So, me being me, I always worry about the future. I don\u2019t know why, but I always have. Sometimes it\u2019s an advantage, being able to predict events days in advance, but my anxiety is really getting to me. I haven\u2019t been officially diagnosed with depression or anything, but I do feel depressed. The ironic thing was I used to be this Uber conservative person. I didn\u2019t care when people got deported. But now, I really do have sympathy for those people. I used to think depression was for the weak minded. Definitely changed on that. I just cut myself for the first time ever. I was too scared to go through with it after a small blotch of blood appeared. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m like this now, I used to be this happy kid not too long ago. Guess I got some humble pie handed to me.","314":"It's quite literally the only way to escape my debt and finances, not even bankruptcy would help me because it's mostly student loan debt. Short of escaping the country and living in the wilderness in India or winning the powerball jackpot suicide is it. I can't live a meaningful life with tens of thousands in collections and a sub-400 credit score at only 21. There's no way in hell I'll be able to pay any of this soon. They're garnishing my wages, gonna told my tax refund etc. I have to slave away at work just for no money. After working 40+ hours a week I have maybe $20 spending money out of a 2-week check, maybe less. Not a cent into savings so I'm not building toward anything either. I've done the math and at this rate it could be over a decade until I pay this all off and then my credit still won't be fixed, and at the end of that it's not like I'll get some magic money - making scheme. I'll still just be an uneducated, manual labor wage slave. My life is going nowhere at all and I can't change that because I'm locked in by this debt. I literally only exist to pay off debt. I don't do anything but work, recover from work, and sleep. I don't have money time or friends to do anything else. This isn't the only reason I wanna kill myself but a very large part.","315":"`&lt; sorry about the long post, but I have no one to talk to and need to talk\/express to someone&gt;`I am 43 now. Had a terrible childhood of negative conditioning and violence - my mom being worse than my Dad. Too many emotionally damaging incidents to detail here. Dad was doing well for a while but spent it all on booze, parties and buying ridiculous gifts for the extended family (Think Rolex, Omega watches etc). Had a nervous breakdown and quit his job under that condition. I was sent to boarding school at 5 years old - so sense of being unworthy and unwanted started early. Plus had a narcissistic mother who put me down and compared me to every sentient being in her consciousness. Both of them reflected their disdain for each other and their failed marriage on to me.Rescued my Dad from a suicide attempt at 13. Survived one myself at 16.  Had a long term relationship (5.5 years) end because of economic incompatibility. Her family was rich, mine wasn't. My parents cried poor all the time anyway -  lived in frugal squalor, let the house fall into extreme disrepair etc.Moved overseas(Aus)  in my mid-20s, to get away from it all. Went through the usual post-911 racist shit, Experienced social, professional marginalisation for half a decade. The social &amp; spiritual isolation was\/is hell!Supported my parents financially nonetheless - wanted to rescue my father. Did this at the expense of my health, hunger and basic needs. Bought oversized clothes at thrift shops for a decade and went hungry a few days a week.Eventually got myself a career.  Killed myself with long hours trying to prove \"brown boy can work\". Got overlooked anyway. My responsibilities to my parents and my desire to 'build the castle before I get the queen' kept me away from relationships. Plus the negative bias\/racist shit I had experienced kept me fearful and insular.Finally went back home - to my 'real' home, to my 'real' friends. Realised home country(India) is an awfully corrupt, morally bankrupt, racist and sexist place. Realised my past friends were just parasites and mutated to ugly adults. Mom still treats me like shit. Dad is spiritually dead. I had failed in rescuing him. Also find out, he basically lied to siphon money out of me to fund his hedonism. They hijack my career for 5 years by keeping me mired in unraveling their court cases and realty issues - they would have ended up homeless - plus we have no support system, so was all up to me. Get incredibly depressed to the point of suicide again.Finally ended up moving back to Aus and starting my career from a few steps down. All the momentum I had earned is now gone. I linger and bounce between jobs for another 5 years.All I have wanted since I was 12 was to have a family of my own, have children, have someone to belong to... Over the past 2 decades I have made sacrifices and decisions for a non-existent wife and child.And here I am. 43. single. lonely. no friends. no one to care for me or call on me on sick days or birthdays, Xmas and assorted holidays - spent these alone for the past 2 decades. I barely have AUD$300k in the bank. My career has stagnated over the past few years - most likely due my insular nature. It pays ok, but is spiritually corrosive in it's middle management monotony.Given the negative social cachet of my ethnic origin, dating is non-existent.  Neither have I  felt attracted to; nor have I been attractive to anyone in a long time. I have waited for things to change, life to get better and I am tired of it. I feel unclaimed, unloveable and condemned to a cursed existence. I have spent a lifetime trying to be a good person...a good son to bad parents, a good friend to bad friends...and on and on.I usually can brush it off, but I have been having persistent thoughts of ending it all. I don't have the will to endure another year of soul crushing loneliness. I am just tired, i need a hug and I need to be loved. And I don't think I ever will be. I feel like I have failed as a human being.`&lt; sorry for all the self pity and victim hood, please be kind. I can't take anymore disdain than what I have for myself&gt;`","316":"It's that thing where you are depressed and barely functioning, so you fuck things up, right? Which makes things worse, so you get more depressed and are even less able to function, so you fuck things up even more. And it spins further and further down, and the inevitable end is suicide, the only remaining option, because there's no coming back from there, there's no escaping that spin.Been trying to improve, using the coping skills I learned from an intensive DBT program a while ago, but the skills aren't working any more, nothing I do has an impact on the way I experience life now. Over a year I tried, and then I just got sick of trying, sick of failing, sick of expending so much effort for no return.My people know I'm experiencing this. My counselor wants me to join a partial hospitalization program, but I know that when they assess me they won't let me join the PHP because I'm too high a risk. I've got a plan, I've got the means, I've got a date, I'm finalizing things in my life -- they would put me in in-patient and I would lose my entire livelihood -- and I have absolutely no faith that I would be any improved at the end. Quite the opposite, actually, with no way to pay my bills, and the stigma or whatever that would result from my missing work for so long. They know, too, my boss and her boss, and her boss. And to my face they're super supportive and kind and sweet, but they also know I have fucked up huge, and that doesn't go away. I know that that impacts the way they think about me.  And if I were to go into the program, they'd have to find people to cover for me during my absence, which means that they will have an even deeper awareness than they already do of just how colossally I have fucked up at work.Called the national suicide hotline a few times, trusting that they had no idea who I was or how to contact me or whatever (or how to report me), and after I made two calls in one day stating that I was absolutely going to kill myself, but ended the conversations after not much time, I received calls from a guy who 'wouldn't ordinarily contact somebody in this way but was concerned.' Because I didn't get to end the conversations, he said, he was afraid that I was ambivalent and wanted to talk some more but might not call because I had 'made the promise.' I don't know. It was confusing. He even acknowledged that it was an invasion of privacy, tried to be very clear that it was an unusual circumstance, and that he would not pursue anything further if I did not wish it.Originally I was going to use rat poison -- the zinc phosphide, when ingested, creates phosphine gas which is quickly toxic, there is no antidote, and resulting symptoms are resistant to traditional treatments (for example, low blood pressure that is typically mitigated by increasing fluid through IV is unresponsive to that treatment, and blood pressure continues to tank). As it turned out, though, you can't get concentrations high enough in the US to make it work reliably. In order to get a dose that would even \\*possibly\\* be toxic, you'd have to eat a whole pound of pellets -- noisome, grainy, awful pellets. I mean, I guess that demonstrates a lack of conviction on my part? But I've moved on, let go of that as a method after completing my research. It's a shame I don't live in India.Now I've got a little over three months' supply of my antidepressant (ironic?), a month's supply of wellbutrin, and a month's supply of Adderall, plus enough sleepy medicine and alcohol to knock me out while the other stuff does its work. I feel bad that I'm not even motivated to get help. I just really have no faith that there's actual meaningful, impactful help out there. I have truly been helped before, but none of that is working any more. I'm the one who has to make me better, you know? And I'm just not interested in trying any more.","317":"I have no more options. I\u2019ve been to psychologists, doctors, therapists, councillors, family, friends. Everything. I\u2019ve gone to the extremes of a very strict diet, and keeping active. I\u2019ve let myself go. I\u2019ve tried drowning myself in my hobbies, work, a balance. Nothing. I had 3 months off work, I didn\u2019t have to worry about money or work. I felt normal for once in my life. I realise that slaving myself away at a false god (money) is what\u2019s going to kill me. I hate working for people, working for money. I\u2019ve been in jobs about helping people, helping yourself, whatever. They\u2019re ALL corrupt. I can\u2019t bear to witness to molestation of this world. Why the fuck haven\u2019t we declared war on China\/India? They\u2019ve done irreversible amounts of damage.. oh yeah, the world wouldn\u2019t make money that way. And no one truely seems to care about the planet unless they can get a couple hundred likes on a photo of them picking up a bag of rubbish. Everyone\u2019s so fake. Everything\u2019s so fake. I feel like I\u2019m an edgy teen all over, but I\u2019m just seeing things for how they are. I will die because of this soon, and. No. One. Will. Care. Because there\u2019s no money in caring, only false caring so people can have their false self image. I cannot scream any louder for help. There are no more avenues. I\u2019ve genuinely exhausted them all. Im done.","318":" To my loving family, friends, and anyone who still remains curious,I  am gone now, and I apologize for any sadness I leave behind. I know  well that suicide is sel\ufb01sh and I have heard it said that the pain I  feel now will not be erased with me, but will be transferred to my  family, but I sincerely hope that is not the case.I  love each of you dearly, we shared so many great moments, I'm sure my  sullen sel\ufb01sh attitude seems illogical. You gave me everything and I  could never offer anything in return, even with the great privilege I was provided.To be absolutely  clear, you were the best and most supportive family I could hope for,  you did everything right in my eyes, so no blame could ever be assigned  to you. There was nothing any of you could have done, for you did all  you could, all anyone could ask, and then some.Given  this, I'm sure this decision is confusing and painful. If there were a  way to spare you of either that didn't involve me living, I would be  glad of it. I hope you can move on and you do not waste precious life  thinking on me or even remembering me. Each of you has something  wonderful inside you that gives you purpose and joy, as I never had.If you need an explanation, if that would help you live on joyfully, it is  provided below. But please waste no time in studying or analyzing the  reasons too long, as they are just the words of a deeply sad person, and  the best thing to do with such a person is protect yourself from them.  Loving as you are, you would never have done this for yourselves, and so  it is the least I could do.I ended my life after 27 years because I was troubled, in more ways than one, hopeless, and overly sel\ufb01sh.When  I began to be depressed, even as early as 3rd grade, I developed an  anger that grew out of control. But by 16, through intensive study and  practice of Tantric meditation, Buddhism, and yoga I was able to subdue  my anger and sadness, most of the time.With  my anger out of the way, hope trickled in like a leak in the roof. I  told myself if I left the state I hated, abandoned the friends that were  not true, and built a life of my own design elsewhere, I might feel  satisfaction and joy.I read in  many places that careful attention to exercise, nutrition, sleep, and  thought patterns could further improve my outlook. Coupled with the  acquisition of a loving partner and a stimulating job, I thought that  might be enough to \ufb01nally extinguish the unrelenting dissatisfaction and  anger that still burned underneath the surface.I  took all the best advice. I worked hard at shitty jobs until I got  better ones. I showed true love and kindness to romantic partners. I  took care of my mind, body, and spirit. I followed the best practices.But  every job felt like indentured servitude. I never lost my awareness  that my romantic partners didn't care about me, they only wanted what I  provided, money, attention, physical intimacy. I could not shake the  knowledge that romantic love is just a deal, a bartering of goods andservices.So I adapted, and tried to \ufb01nd happiness in solitude, without a partner. I broke up with every girlfriend I ever had.I  worked even harder to build a business where I worked for myself, one  where I could feel \ufb01nancial freedom and independence, and maybe a sense  of accomplishment.I strived  harder in the areas in which people already dubbed me militant. I went  from eating all natural to vegan. Paying special attention to diet  micros and macros to ensure my body had everything it needed, not only  to feel good, but to look good, which I hoped would keep my self  con\ufb01dence and esteem high, for the sake of my mental health. Yet, no matter how fit or attractive I was or was not, I felt much the same. Terrible. Sad. Angry.Along the way, I tried anti-depressants prescribed by doctors. After trying many, and giving them a  fair shot, I quit them and relied on natural remedies that were more  effective and without side effects, and saw some mild improvement over a decade, but they were still woefully insufficient. I  talked to a therapist weekly for 4 years, though none of you knew,  secretly hoping that a trained professional with decades of experience  my know something I did not, but as far as she could tell, I was \ufb01ne.  Everybody thought I was just \ufb01ne.I  even tried experimental drugs entitled nootropics that were meant to be  safe, non-toxic, and mood enhancing. Whatever various effects they had,  they were insu\ufb03cient.So I moved  on to \"recreational\" drugs that have been known to combat depression,  even in clinical trials. LSD, THC, and DMT , and while they helped I  would require and endless supply to maintain any improvement.Luckily,  I had moved to California, and I was industrious, so I created my own  grow operation to supply me with enough cannabis and therefore money for  LSD that I might never run out. But I found quickly that they were no  cure. They were like a bandaid for something that needed stitches, or  perhaps amputation.Believe me  when I say, I experimented with dosages and combinations of every  concoction of supplements and drugs that money and intensive searching  could procure. Still, just at the edges of every moment, was the same  sadness waiting to burst onto the scene. And it always did.While conventional wisdom of health,  newer scientific remedies, and eastern mysticism had failed, I had a few more ideas.Artistic  expression for one, my brother the genius was a brilliant artist and  supportive mentor in this. I feel I have let him down, but for every  moment of joy art birthed, it came with triplets of misery, and with the  fullness of time it became clear that it was an exercise in futility,  one which I persisted in for 10 years.I  thought perhaps I was missing something spiritually, so I made a habit  of studying religions, cults, and eventually the occult arts too. Yes,  I'm speaking of magic.Apart from  satanism and demonology, of which I was familiar, I practiced and  experimented with all forms I could. I stole from the internet every  occult or illegal book, hoping that perhapsthe  secrets were hidden deep in a book, or inside myself, somewhere along  the route previously tread by some of the most bizarre and dizzying  intellects ever to walk the earth and write a book.While  perhaps it is my failing, as I am quick to admit that some of the texts  were of such complexity it is possible I failed to understand them  fully, I do contend that most of what is practiced relates to either the  induction of trance states or the transformation of one's mental  paradigm, a sort of mental gymnastics.Well,  every trance state was \ufb02eeting like my joy, and no mental gymnastics  long contorted my mind to tranquility. Soon my trances ended, and my  mind resumed its normal maddening form, not fundamentally altered, just  mildly warped.By now some clever  reader might be thinking that I was just lonely, but I had considered  this, aside from my fruitless romances, I did join groups such as  meetups for specific activities and spiritual organizations like the  SGI, where there gathered a community that shared stories of how they  overcame challenges, hard challenges like cancer, and marched on  victoriously.Unfortunately, I  found myself detesting these groups and the people in them. I felt no  pleasure in subjugating myself to their ideals, endlessly praising each  other and their \"leaders\" and prattling on about their lives, desperate  for a little encouragement and recognition just so they wouldn't feel  alone. They clung to the group like a crack addict clings to their pipe.  Suckling for another drop of relief from their lonely, miserable lives.But  I recognized it might take some time so I did as they did. I  hypothesized I might be doing them a service, giving them space, being a  listening ear, and a little sel\ufb02ess service might yield its own  rewards.Yet still, no matter how I  imitated their behavior, I clearly did not get whatever they were  getting out of these interactions, and sel\ufb02ess service did nothing for  my mood. If anything, I felt more drained than ever, so I \ufb02ed.Just  as I had so many times before, from my family, my romantic partners, I  left my home state, my jobs, college, Chicago, California, India,  Mexico, wherever I went there I was, miserable inside.Nearly  20 years since the sadness \ufb01rst began, having tried everything I was  ever suggested with no success, every last drop of hope was \ufb01nally  spent.While many think of those  that commit suicide as quitters, and this may be accurate, my only  consolation is that I did, in fact, try very hard to \ufb01x my problem by  every means I could think to try.Having  heard a great variety of treatment methods, you may at this point be  wondering what was this peculiar misery from which I ran. I wondered the  same the entire time, hence the great variety of the treatments.All  I can say is that I was from childhood completely disillusioned with  all institutions. Religion was a pack of intolerant charlatans. School  is a federal brainwashing prison. The government is an organization with  mass mind control, subjugation, and exploitation as its only mission.  Jobs, soul-sucking wage-slavery, modern indentured servitude meant to  keep worker drones barely atthe  level of sustenance until they are too old and worn out to work, at  which point society comes in, harvests whatever monies they have accrued  in their retirement before \ufb01nally consigning them to the grave.What  is there to be accomplished? What legacy lasts? Why should anyone care  when, as we all know, but few can bare to admit to themselves, it all  falls apart in the end?Why not  just enjoy the ride? What ride? Enjoy the governments mind control  advertising media? Enjoy the school's federal propaganda while you  breathe elevated CO2 levels still, trapped to a chair? Enjoy the same  monotonous, purposeless job day after day? Enjoy empty relationships  based on the unspoken fact that they are predicated upon a personal  gain? And they are. If at any point you stop providing money, or you are  no longer physically attractive, know well that the love is gone. For  whatever romantic reads this, you need only look at the divorce  statistics to wake yourself from your delusion.Should  I have found joy in the caring for a child? As if I would bring a child  into this. Or a dog perhaps? That beast that is among the most loving  of all creatures that would eat me alive a few short days after their  food dish ran dry.What should I  have lived for? Smelling roses? A breathe of fresh air? The roses that, like all the foods, have been genetically modi\ufb01ed and coated in pesticides. The air that is  thick with the exhaust of man's crude machines. Perhaps I should have  listened to the sweet songs of the birds, if only they could be heard buried deep below the clangs of new construction.Humans  have terraformed nearly every square inch of this plane into something  unrecognizable and monstrous. Even in the face of the warnings of great  men, shouting to us from thousands of years in the past,Lao Tzu wrote,&gt;*Do you want to improve the world?*  *I don't think it can be done.*  *The world is sacred. It can't be improved.*  *If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.*  *If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.*Now  we stand on the brink of self-extinction, along with the obliteration  of  every natural resource we hold dear. The air, the earth, all its  \ufb02ora and fauna shall be laid barren even for us, who seem to be able to  thrive in the most miserable of conditions.How  could someone like me that grew up in such comfort \ufb01nd any joy in the  ruined world that we soon shall inherit from our deplorable forefathers?Whatever  hope there is, is not in me. Not anymore. And unlike my peers I will  not keep shouting into the void that is social media and unlike those who will come after, I refuse to bury my head in VR headsets until the  lights go out. Video games with their rigid rules celebrate competition, not creativity, and mindless  con\ufb02ict, not unlike politics. In video games, you are assigned a team like red team or  blue team, and like the Colosseum of old and the modern day sports   stadiums so cherished, blockheads bash each others' brains out  in a competition that should be recognized as a sort of violent energy vampirization, in which the loser is drained of his energy, and so the  winner is elated, having fed off their misery and defeat. The injured  party is so depleted of energy and happiness, what is left for them but to to correct this  energy imbalance by jumping back into the ring in a vain attempt to  recapture their lost energy from a new opponent, destroying their opponents' and their own bodies  and minds in the process.Waste  not your energy in that ring, and seek not the council of therapists,  having known many personally, I say with con\ufb01dence they are among the  most confused and miserable of people, and the best of them can get  through the daily toils of their job without anyone being the wiser that  they have the emotional sophistication of a termite, understanding as much or less about life in total.Indeed,  there is no one that does not suffer from this endless sadness that can help, no  doctor, loved one, counselor, sage, yogi, mystic, or magician.Know  well, from someone who has sought them all with fervor, if you feel as I  feel, if you see as I see, that you like everyone are truly and deeply alone. Not  even I, who knows exactly how you feel is here anymore.I love you all with all my heart, which is less than half as any of you deserve.\\-Om Gone Now","319":"Been having a really bad depressive episode lately I really need a number I can call in case of emergencies but I'm not sure if the suicide prevention hotlines in India are run by well trained professionals who actually know what they're doing or that their response rate is even good??

I'm a pathological liar, incompetent at almost everything I do, and horribly selfish. I'm weak, mentally and physically. I've been horrible to my roommates, and I think one of them transferred out of my university because of it. I ask people for help but end up wasting their time.

I took up law because I had to have a college, but all I always wanted was to write. I've written a book, and whoever read it told me it is good, and as a writer I'll make it someday soon. I'm writing another too, as the first one gains some traction. But what happened is, I have been demoted twice now. Failed twice in law school. The first time it happened, my parents found out I also smoked marijuana, and for a year they had me put up in a house arrest kind of a situation, as they had recently shifted from Delhi to another smaller city in India. I was depressed, as depressed as I had ever been. I got bronchitis, then typhoid and pneumonia at the same time, lost around 20 KGS of weight, and I was by default a skinny guy too. Now, I tried my level best over the past year to set my academic life straight, almost made it too. Thing is, I'm from one of the best law schools of the country, and now I have failed again. I don't have the will to fight, anymore. The hardest part is being on a campus, in a hostel, and waking up at awkward times in the night alone, and then realizing that what has happened has indeed happened. I can't tell my parents. If you knew them, you would know what I mean. I can't help crying like a jackass while writing this. I can't help it anymore, and have been thinking about suicide for too long a time. It happened the last time too, and I made it alive, even though it was after so much damage that I caused to myself. This time, I don't know what to do anymore.  It is 1 21 am in India, and I woke up after sleeping for six hours, just now. I've lost, and I hate myself for it.","326":"Hi allIam writing this probably will be my last post that's what i tell myself everytime but it doesn't happen to be my last post every time, little background about myself born and grew up in upper middle class family done bachelor in computer science and got accepted in Australia for masters with 30% scholarship , iam in a relationship with a girl she hardly replies me since we are in a long distance relationship like once a week or such i know it's very very less but i back then i thought she was my angel and she was really great and supportive but today something happened that entirely shocked me I texted her that i need help please talk with me iam feeling very very lonely iam scared , all she replied is have a good day ahead i doubt whether she read my message?

Thanks and love from India","327":"Hey all, hope everyone here has been holding strong. I am a 24 y\/o guy from India. I've been holding things inside me for over 2-3 years now and was desperate to let it out somewhere, so thought of writing this post. This will be a long post, so I request you all to be patient and give some of your time for reading this rant. Let me give you a little background about myself:1. When I was young, I was always passionate, or let's say, infatuated by astronomy and studying about galaxies and space stuff, you know like how lot of kids are. In India, pursuing a serious career, especially in STEM is a very big thing and hence, very competitive. I wouldn't call myself a brilliant student throughout school, but I was quite decent. I remember how it took me twice the amount of time as my classmates in school to learn basic math (when I say basic I mean addition\/subtraction \/fractions etc), and I used to hustle for hours to learn the basic stuff. Getting good grades in exams was always a struggle for me, but I somehow managed it till middle school. I believe this planted the seed of inferiority complex and lack of confidence in me as I started comparing by abilities and academic efficiency with others'.2. I grew up in a family where my parents fought day in and day out and there was no familial harmony. Though, they made sure I wasn't left devoid of any support, this disharmony started to make me feel detached from them. By the time I was a teenager, I had seen enough of this. So much that I did not want my friends to visit me and see how my parents fought. I did not want to talk to anyone, or even want to make friends. I simply used to interact with them for some obvious social reasons, but never enjoyed bonding with anyone. I started weaving a cocoon of silence and detachment around myself. I felt comfortable. And... secluded.3. I then went  to college to pursue my BS in physics. Though, I was not very happy with my choice of university, I was hopeful it could help me launch myself strongly in the field. This was a time when I was happy I was away from home and could meet new people, learn a lot, and maybe change myself for good. A year later, my parents split up and whatever harmony was left, had just committed suicide. There was a wrath of emotional wars, arguments, cursing and blaming between my mom and dad and I was the one who was forced to mediate matters between them. This shook my mental peace and crunched my emotional stability. I didn't have much friends in college so there weren't much people I could talk about this with. Moreover, I have always suffered from nervousness and anxiety so I can never keep myself confident and calm during times of pressure, and tend to obsess over my my failures and mistakes- You know the typical \"**I wish I did not do this**\" attitude.4. A year later in college, I met a girl who had a similar family history of feuds and disharmony and I shared all that I could with her. We became good friends (very close in terms of sharing personal matters) and started dating few months later. Although, this soothed my emotional distress, I started getting distracted from academics. This was the fist time I felt a very strong attachment to someone. However, all this cost me to flunk in one of the courses and I had to drop a year before I could go further for MS. Just as I started prepping myself for entrance exams (equivalent to physics GRE) to get into good universities for MS, this girl said she wanted to break up with me. Once again, it started another round of emotional shit in my life. My mom despised this girl and did not want me to date her, and at the same time I didn't feel like letting go of her. I feared I couldn't get someone else I could open up to all over again. To this day I call myself a loser for having wasted my time in such trivial matters and curse myself for being so vulnerable. Fast forward to a year later, I didn't do well in the entrance exam, missed my dream university, and once again had to settle for a mediocre university surrounded by people I did not enjoy being with.I fucked up my GPA and am now sitting at home prepping for GRE, hoping I can still find something meaningful, something broader, and get a fresh new perspective in life. The whole series of mistakes, my flaws and my choices has drained my confidence and hope to absolute zero. Every time I see my friends doing what they like, travelling, exploring new aspects of life, while I am at a standstill, I feel I can never amount to anything. Hell, I cant even talk to someone looking straight into their eyes. Sitting here at home just brings back those dark flashes of my failed past. Everyday, I wake up thinking I have to wake up because I am, unfortunately, alive.I've successfully nurtured an absolutely messed up, pessimistic mind, with no vision, no hope and no desires. I strongly feel like ending my life everyday, but can't muster up enough courage for it. I think that even people who end up getting rid of their lives have the will, the extreme will to do it. And if helped, can channelize this will to a positive domain. I, however, have no will- no will to live, and at the same time no will to do something about it. I can't imagine the pain I'd have to go through and this stops me from doing anything harmful to myself. I don't talk about this with my parents, because they're probably depressed as well. No one in the family is in the right state of mind to help anyone in this matter.Finally, if there's anyone out there who is depressed because you had a breakup, I can understand it feels terrible, but know one thing that if you build a good career, you'll have chances of meeting lot of better people. Nothing haunts you as bad as a failed career and the pain of not getting the job or the college you wanted.If you read through the whole depressive rant, I genuinely thank you. If you can drop any suggestions on how you fought your depression, I'd really appreciate it.And if you did not read the whole thing,**TL; DR**: *To live, or not to live*That is the question.P.S. Please feel free to drop your thoughts and express how you feel. I believe if people can relate their mindsets and thought patterns to others', they can help each other out.","328":"Pls help me the suicide helpline doesn't work here india","329":"Hello all, so I don't know what to do. Please pardon me if I am offending anyone here, I really don't intend to. I am currently a Masters student in USA, and I completed my undergrad in IIT Bombay (often touted as India's best college). I have two parents who have given me food 3 times a day and funded every single bit of my education. I have always been surrounded by people who I'm comfortable with and I guess vice versa. Basically, my life seems fine, at least I don't know, better than most. I have never faced an issue my entire life, in fact, the only big issue i had was.... ok nothing actually. I haven't faced any issues. Almost anything I wanted materialistically, I have it. A good gaming pc, I got it. Good food, my mom made it. Good mobile, dad bought it. Good friends, I think I got it. Coming to the problem. As I said, I have faced absolutely no issues in life. College and school were fun (at least for the most part). The problem is me. I feel I am a burden to everyone close to me. I have no motivation for doing anything. That gaming PC I talked about, I don't have the guts to play anything new, all I do is play vs bots in DotA. I have a very chaotic mind (which I am sure everyone does), but I can never do a task properly, I always leave it incomplete. Anything I wanna do by myself is never happening. My motivation has been an all time low. I tried doing something about things, I tried to set goals, but I am not able to achieve anything. Falling short of everything. I even hurt the one woman I liked, and I know it is my fault. The problem is me, just me. I can't stop thinking, about anything. I don't know how to control my mind. If I'm having bad thoughts, I cannot shrug it off. I have become so scared of my brain that I am afraid of doing anything that involves me thinking. I cannot study for tests properly, I cannot do projects and assignments properly, heck I am so afraid of my brain, I can't even go take a shower because I fear I have to listen to my thoughts for 5 mins. I am a selfish person, but I do care about people. At this moment, I don't know what to do. I just want everything to stop. I tried medicines, listening to therapists, people, but no. Well actually, I say I try, I can't even try this properly because, well, my brain doesen't make exceptions for anything. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if I am sounding repetitive, but I am just voicing whatever's running in my thoughts. I wanna just end myself, but I am very scared of doing that too, survival instincts I guess. I wanna think about what would happen if I die to other people, but honestly, why should I give a flying f\\*\\*\\*.","330":"I don\u2019t know where to go, and this place seems like a place where I can talk about what happened without being judged...(I\u2019m on mobile so sorry if it looks shitty, but what else is new?)I was a Japanologist. Almost failed my first year, worked hard to receive my MEXT scolarship in third and go to Japan to study for a year. Summer before I leave I get raped. I go to Japan and I get to let it go and escape it for awhile. I date, have sex, enjoy. It\u2019s in the back of my head but it\u2019s something I left back in my homecountry. I\u2019m okay.I meet a boy. We become friends. He\u2019s nice. We start dating.It turns to summer again. I almost have to go back home. Suddenly a man I grew up with back home commits suicide. He promised to visit me while I was in Japan. We had an argument but I was sure we\u2019d patch it back up. Except now we can\u2019t.I get insomnia, have to see a counselor in Japan. She has no idea what she\u2019s doing, but she tries and I\u2019m grateful.The guy I\u2019m dating is sweet but depressed. We help each other wallow and grieve and cry. He\u2019s nice, but when I\u2019m not in the mood he still has sex with me.He wants to continue our relationship.I go back home, see a counselor. Manage to graduate as a Japanologist, but after all that\u2019s happened it doesn\u2019t seem that important anymore. I dredge through the next year, with ups and downs and help from my psychologist.Next September I decide to work in Japan so I can see my bf. He\u2019s sweet but long distance is hard.My working experience is horrible. I was doing better, but the people are closed, demanding, apathic. My depression gets worse again. I always have to go see my bf, he never comes to see me. He\u2019s doing worse and so am I. I am struggling. I came all this way for him and he\u2019s leaving me hanging.I leave the job early, spend two weeks with my bf and go back home. I love him but I feel alone.I double my psychologist appointments again and start a new degree in psychology.I meet new people, the study is intriguing and going well. By summer I\u2019m doing much better than I have at any point in the last two years.I break up with my bf in november. I feel unloved and unsupported, but the decision still fucks me up. I screw up my first semester big time.I go to India in februari with my school. We have a \u201cwomen in prostitution\u201d talk which is actually just a women talking about her life, kidnapped and raped for money. I get a panic attack for the first time in years. My teacher comforts me. I overcome this moment. It is a defining moment in my healing process.I\u2019m seeing a boy. We date, casually. I fall in love with him. He knows I\u2019m poly, he doesn\u2019t mind. I want to be monogamous with him, but I want to take it slow.We spend our weekends together, study for upcoming exams. I\u2019m optimistic it will go well. If I do well in these exams, I think I can overcome the bad first semester and do well in my second chance exams in summer.Another girl kisses him. I tell him I\u2019m in love with him and want to be with him. He tells me he sees a future between us, wants to travel with me. He tells me he wants me not to see other people. I agree, tell my other dates I\u2019m going monogamous. All through this I was honest to everyone. I feel good about my decision, and motivated for the exams.Exam period is hard. The guy is struggling, and I\u2019m focused more on his feelings than my own. I try to support him via text, we don\u2019t meet for about a month. I feel like all my exams go exceedingly well.He starts ignoring my texts. Exams finish, he doesn\u2019t ask to meet up. I go to Spain with my mom but can\u2019t focus, all I think of is him. I pray for it to go well, I haven\u2019t been this in love in ages.I come back home, he tells me he\u2019s been dating the other girl that kissed him for about a month. They started dating the week after he told me he sees a future with me and wants us to be monogamous with me.I break.The next day, man I LARP with attempts suicide. He\u2019s in a coma for two days before he passes away.I break.I get my results two days after that. I failed all my second semester exams.I\u2019m broken.All I can think of is how hard I\u2019ve worked and how it\u2019s all been for nothing. I will fall in love again, sure, but in this moment, the guy I was planning my future with isn\u2019t in love with me and that hurts so much. It makes me feel not good enough, not attractive enough, not interesting enough.Another person I know, struggled their whole life, took their own live in their thirties, and it speaks volumes to me. Their friends ignoring all the warning signs, no empathy until he slits his wrists and it\u2019s too late. And life goes on. It goes on without him, just like it will go on without me.It keeps coming back to me as this inevitable thing. Why keep drudging on if I\u2019m going to end up commiting suicide at 35 anyway?And my grades... I can\u2019t even think about them without crying. I love what I\u2019m doing. My first semester this year I fucked up and I know it, but this semester was different. I worked fucking hard and did I have issues? Hell yeah but I studied and was sure I was going to pass, pretty damn sure I was going to pass with flying colours too.Everything seems useless. And I just do not have the will to keep on pushing anymore.","331":"I have a lot of friends at school. I don't have many problems except a few big ones. My parents are going through a tough time in their marriage but they are getting help for it and so are we as our parents used to hit us a lot. In India it was a common thing for children (like me) to be hit by their parents and I guess my parents thought it was OK in Canada as well. Even though I am also getting help (as well as my brother) from a social worker, I have a hard time opening up with him.My other problem is that I always procrastinate with homework. I'm in grade 7, and even though we are getting close to the end of the year (the last day of school is on June 28 this year). As of writing this (June 11) I have 3 HUGE projects due tomorrow. Instead of doing them, I am typing this up.  I have slight ADD, and I feel like no matter what I do, it isn't enough for my parents and my family. I feel that even if I try my best to say something nice, I fuck up horribly and turn it into an insult. I am one year younger than the rest of my class. Whenever I go to sleep and wake up the next morning I wake up asking myself how I will fuck up today. Since I am one year younger than everyone, people make fun of me for being a pussy. I'm not that strong, and pretty light. Whenever my parents scream at me I feel worthless (chances are I am). Literally the only thing I am good at is swearing, playing video games in class, and rapping (not that good). I just wish someone could tell me that I *am* worth something. I don't usually post on Reddit, and never posted on these types of subreddits. If I seem fake, then think of me what you want to. This is not my real account. I don't want to tell people of my main account because I'm afraid people will find out I posted this. I don't even think the person I like (in my class) knows i'm a person. No matter what I do, I wish for myself to have the most anti-climactic death ever. I wish I could be a better person to everyone.Another thing is that my friends tell me why I always act so happy. I always \"joke\" that I am depressed and they believe that it is just a joke. I don't know what to do or say. I wish I could speak my mind to my parents and the social worker and ask them f or help without being afraid that people would call my a \"dumbass pussy bitch\" for  saying that I am depressed. I don't think anyone knows that I might be hurting this much except myself. No matter what.. ***nobody*** would be sad if I jumped of a cliff right now. I keep on fucking up.Since I have to do a few things tomorrow at school, I suggested the idea to my friends (as a \"joke\"), that I jump of a cliff, and never have to present anything. Sorry if I waste your time just skip past this.TL;DR: I am struggling to do anything and keep focused on my tasks.","332":"I've failed Math in college. Because of this I won't be able to go to University. (Incase anyone gets confused, In India you need to clear your 10+2 exams which is basically a state board exam. I've got an F in maths which has resulted me in failing the entire year. I feel like total shit right now. Feel like I wasted my father's money in tuitions and shit. I've got to appear for a exam again in July but I don't think I'll be able to pass that. I see all my friends putting up their marks on Instagram and it's gonna make me kill myself really. I don't know what I'll tell them. Worst thing is I'll see all my friends go to University and I'll be alone with no one. All my career options seem to fade away now and I'll have no other choice. I will be the black sheep of my family and turn out to be the person no one will look up to. (Eg. \"Do you want to turn out like your uncle Aaron?\") I don't know what I'll do now. I feel like killing myself. Atleast my parents won't need to pay for any of my fees anymore. Worst ever feeling is that some of the teachers were actually expecting me to score great marks. I've let down everyone I know and I can't bear to think about that. I feel like I've lost the battle.","333":"As I am writing this I am slowly realizing how fucked up I am. My life has been nothing but a joke these past sixteen years, I feel as though I have been living in some type of hell I cannot escape from so thats why im writing this note. I'm hoping all my pain will be gone in death. Heres the story of my life, I was born august 29th 2002 in some city somewhere my parents used to be rich in real estate but everything went to shit when the market crashed. We moved place to place, to other countries even. You could say my childhood was when I was the most happiest but I always felt as though something was wrong when I was 5 or 6 I started dealing with suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone because i felt as though they would act like something was wrong with me. But fast foward a few years and I'm back in my old hometown and I'm eight years old and my father starts touching me this carries on for five years and the sexual abuse starts progressively getting worse and worse. He talks to my mother about sending her on a trip to India by herself and says he will \"watch\" me and my brother. I knew I was going to end up getting raped, I thought of suicide everyday. I even tried drinking bleach, anyway to set myself free from the hell I was living in. In a matter of days I tell my mother, I couldn't suffer anymore at the hands of my father. I told her about what he had been doing to me and she calls him and screams at him and whatever. But thankfully they are divorced now and i live far away from him.So now present day I have lived in a new city since late 2015 and went to school for the first time in years of course it ends badly for me because you know my life is a fucking mess. I find out I have multiple learning disabilities and low IQ, so you could say my school situation was hell. I got no help for my learning disabilities and on top of that I was getting relentlessly bullied by everyone in my grade. I made some friends but they haven't spoken to me since freshman year. Every friend I have ever made in life has left me or used me for their own personal gain. No one has EVER stuck around, no one has ever gave a single fuck about me. Sophmore year was fun when I had people to make it fun, I used to have a lot of friends but because of my depression everyone has just abandoned ship even the love of my life. He was the only man to ever make me feel something, he intrigued me, made me feel like living and I was\/am in love with everything about him. We dated for a month he was my first boyfriend and my first love but of course my depression came and fucked it up, I was happy in the beginning of my relationship with him but then as always my depression, my suicidal thoughts came back. I felt like I could never be with him intimately because of what happened to me, even the thought of touching him gave me flashbacks. He broke up with me in december, we tried to get back together in march but i pushed him away. And now i have no one. No friendsNo family that cares about meNothing I know no one will miss me when I'm gone so there is no point in writing a \"i love u mom\" or \"im sorry im doing this ily guys\" type thing. I wont be missed no one will care.I shouldnt have been born.NothingGetsBetterEver.Goodbye","334":"I'm tired and it's time for me to go home. I'm sorry to my family who have done everything they can to help me. Sorry to my friends for not being able to stick around any longer. I've been suffering. More than I've let on. I've been trapped on the top floor of a burning building and the smoke has been choking me. It's been steadily getting thicker and thicker and I'm not able to endure it any longer. Jumping out the window might not seem like the ideal thing to do, but it is the less painful of the two options. The fire can't be put out. I've tried my best. The foundations of my building are weak, they've been compromised beyond repair. Although this will no doubt cause a lot of pain to those around me and it might not seem like it now, but I know there will be some good that will come of this.&amp;#x200B;My guitar can go to David. My ticket to Sun Kil Moon can go to Josh. I will give my last paycheck to charity.&amp;#x200B;Music has always been very important to me and it gave me a great deal of comfort amongst the smoke. If there are any songs to remember me by, it's Motion Picture Soundtrack and Codex by Radiohead, Evening Pills and Warm by All India Radio, and Saint by Jakob. These songs calmed me and made me feel ok for a short while. They were like a warm hug, kind of like what I imagine the next stage will be like.&amp;#x200B;Goodbye.","335":"last month,in April 2019,in bhopal city of madhya pradesh India,a body was recovered inside a tourist attraction,Lake shahpura.she was recovered after 5 days of missing report being filed by her family.her laptop was also recovered along with her,that made it more suspecious for the people of that locality.upon intterogation with her family,it was discovered that she was in a bad mental state from last few days,but never disclosed anything upon asking,she had cutoff from her friends and also was not eating food from last few days.she never left her laptop during this time and used to stare at it for hours at a singke sitting.upon asking in her locality,no one had any clue about this.she was a ranker in her college and always topped in her class.also from last few days,there are reports of sighting of a strange figure that looks like a girl using her computer in different localities of bhopal,most sightings reported near mp nagar,shahpura,kolar road and ashoka garden,there are talks about that being a ghost of that girl.sightings are increasing daily and more reports have started to come in.some people who reported multiple sightings, mentioned that they usually see her on the first floor of buildings specially balcony and doors who had openings outside buildings but on first floor only.these facts were confirmed by other people who reported this sightings.some people are reported to suffer through a trauma because of this and others have stopped leaving their house after 12 in night,the time during which she is usually sighted.the cause of her suicide still remains a mystery as there is no statement to support this fact.and as the days are passing by,the ghost with a computer us becoming a prevelent belief in those areas,even some police officials have also confirmed to have sighted such figures,it it turns into a doll if observed very closely.in some reports it also disappered in just a blink.no reports have came up to confirm any losses or harmful actions of that ghost.but the people who suffered)suffering from the trauma,explained that she tried to explain some things to them through her hands and others say that they usually see her in her dreams during their sleep in the morning.i hope this mystery soon solves.","336":" Greetings! This is my first post here so do bear with me. I'm a 27 year old Indian and I've been a hikkikomori aka a NEET for 3 years now and I've spent an entire life behind a screen watching movies, tv shows and playing video games. Recently, I've been into anime and a bit of J-drama and K-drama as well. I'm introverted af. Its not that I can't talk to people but I prefer not to. I have never dated or even had a relationship in my entire life. In my 27 years of life, the only two times I've had sex were with hookers whom I paid to have sex with me in order to lose my V-card. I was never good with making women laugh. Hell, I've never even had a female friend. I discovered that I found more pleasure in masturbation than in the two times I had sex. Oh, and I'm a chronic masturbator as well. Been that way my entire life. Anyway, as far as I can remember, since early childhood, the only sense of joy and happiness I could ever find was from a screen. Whether it was watching a TV show like Friends or Two and a Half Men or watching superhero related media like The Dark Knight, the only joy I ever found was behind a screen. I had friends in my school and college years but they were just a few and I've lost touch with them which was inevitable and expected. After college, I went to study abroad in Vancouver. I fucked it up by failing a course...twice! Anyway, just like the coward that I am, I came back home to live with my parents and its been 3 years now and I feel like I am at the end of my life struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies. Been struggling with depression since I was 16 btw. Used to drink a lot to escape it, as a matter of fact. I don't wanna work despite my parents forcing me and scolding me almost everyday about not having a job. I find working mundane 9 to 5 jobs meaningless and I've not found one thing I'm good at that I can use as a source of income in my 27 years of life. I feel no point in existing, have found no meaning in life to keep on going but I somehow escape reality by watching a show or movie or playing a video game. I try to escape my sad reality that way.I'm a patient of epilepsy so I sometimes wonder whether all the depression, suicidal tendencies and anxiety and overall, sadness is derived from my epilepsy. Either that or its from the medication I've been taking to keep my epilepsy in check in order to prevent me from having seizures. The medication maintains my brain chemistry and even tho it prevents any seizures and such, its side effects are literally suicidal tendencies, depression and anxiety among many others. But that doesn't mean I don't have epileptic symptoms every now and then, like whenever I brush my teeth, I get the feeling like a seizure is about to hit me in my mouth. This happens every other week currently. Anyway, I have been epileptic since the year 2000. Now, I am being a useless pos living with my parents contemplating suicide. I have a good feeling that tonight might finally be the night to find that peace that I have been desperately looking for. Death by asphyxiation with a belt is how I intend to kill myself. I wish I could go back to Canada but I don't have the financial resources to do that since I have 0 bucks to my name. All I have is this Alienware laptop I bought in Vancouver. Getting a mundane job is too depressing and if I know myself, it won't be before a week I quit the job. The longest work I've ever had was for over a year doing this security gig where I basically had to do nothing but sit in front of live-security footage of a building. I feel like thats the ideal job for me even tho it sucks at pay. I can't do that sorta work here in India since the pay is next to nothing here compared to in Vancouver where at least you can survive on those wages. When I think of the biggest regret of my life ie. coming back here, I feel like I would have failed at life either way since I had nobody back there in Vancouver. (Vancouver sure is a lonely city tbh) I had just one friend over there who was a big help to me. But even there, I was living a pretty lonely job despite doing the security gig. Oh, and the reason I came back was due to visa issues, you know...after failing two times. I could have taken that course for the third time but I don't know what it was but my lack of courage and my laziness made me quit that course and come back to India. Sorry for anyone reading this if it feels like a rambling. Either way, I am on the verge of killing myself with that belt as I write this...Thanks for taking the time and bearing with me to read this long life story of mine.","337":"Throwaway account that has some mild links to the real me in the name. Just in case someone actually cares enough to try and help meSo yeah, im Pretty sure I have mild depression. I haven't been able to sustain motivation which was the only thing that kept my ADD from being a setback for me. Initaly I perceived my parents weren't the type to understand mental health. At least they didn't believe it'd be any help for me after we moved countries. This was a major issue as after we moved my life fell apart completely. While i was the type of kid who struggled to make friends but would immediately get attached to the one's I could make. Now changing countries with no idea of how to blend in the new environment fucked me upNow 4 years after that move the last of my strained abilities to maintain any figment of my prior self has died. I'm no longer as athletic as I was. I lack most of my prior creative drive. My grades plummet and rise with illogical connections and I've grown about a foot. Basically I no longer reconise my prior self and have become a hollow shell of my past self. And that's the story without all the tragediesInitially a few weeks after moving to the new country my grandmother died from a hear related infliction my family still hasn't told me the full story (even after 3 and 7\/12th years) leaving my grandfather in our custody (very important later on) this was already a heavy blow on me and my uncle (my father's brother) who so far was the only other person close to me that I knew had depression. A year later that same uncle was shot and killed in a homicide case, he was leaving the bank and was shot by one or more people (3 years later and my family also hasn't told me the full story) 2 consecutive deaths in the progression of one year after moving countries hasn't been kind on my psyche. Now to the point of my grandfather. He wasn't all that sane of a man before my grandmother died but now he acts more like a rabid animal. Not the best veiw to have of your grandfather but it's true and I have plenty of experiences to explain why. Initally he became more \"suicidal\" in his eating habits, where he ate tones of sugar even though he's a type 1 diabetic. This progressed into him stealing food to horad in his room... After all that my parents realized he might be going insane as he allready was on heavy medication for some prior mental illness (he was a pharmacist in the past and self prescribed alot leading to some braindamage? I don't know the details as usual as my family loves keeping their secrets from the younger generation) this man now has de-evolved to the point where he's past shame and does whatever he likes alongside verbally and physical abusing people. So he's usually kept inside his room through bribery and sometimes baracading. But my father refuses to send him to any medical facility (although they tried to send him to a temple... That ended badly and tarnished our image there. Too bad I'm not religious anyways)Now about the moving of countries. I was shifted from the United States to the shitshow mother nation of mine   ***INDIA*** where the people are shitty and my family here varies from isolated country side hillbillies and well mannered and posh city dwelers. I was the only one from a foreign and suburban environment and counfused as fuck. The people in school where nice originally and some still are but I was really bad at first impressions and kept to myself too much. Now I was lied to originally that I was in the nation for a year to 2 at max but the series of deaths and misfortunes had further propelled us to a point where we wherent sure how long it would last...Now all these fuckups an I sit here with my fucked up brain wondering if I really should overdose on these prescription drugs. Haven't done it yet but every day I edge closer. Never was suicidal but I've been lied to alot about when I'm going to be leaving this forsaken life where I believed everything was temporary and disposable. I lack any personality anymore and all I've got left is some shallow amount of my prior self and a series of unfortunate events and issues trailing me. I've almost resorted to self harm but I couldn't handle the pain and decided to just shed whatever hurt me behind. So please. Can someone please help me make sense of this mess or at least help me plan my suicide in a way it'll hurt the least","338":"So Im going to be completely honest here I am probably the biggest self loather you'll ever see. And I am also what many call a shit-skin, and ive been trying and trying relentlessly to bleach and get rid of the stupid brown color but its just not going anywhere, IT KEEPS COMING BACK. I dont know how Michael Jackson did it, but looks like you need alot of money to scrape that much disgusting melanin from your skin and turn white. I am from the dirtiest shit hole country on earth (India), and ive hated it from the moment I was born. See, I grew up in the west, so indian males outside india are the ultimate human punching bags.All the shows, movies, pop culture, and stereotypes have us a weak, pathetic, nerdy losers. My entire life growing up I knew I was fundamentally less pleasing to look at than all my classmates who were white, black, chinese, and mexican. Our genetics are so awful, I believe there can be no god if he cursed us with such awful genes and such a cringe worthy culture. No matter how much you work out, or try to improve, the shitty indian genetics steps in and ruins everything. To add to that, I knew since I was at least 10 years old that there is no way I would ever be able to date any girls when I grew up. Actually ive been on reddit since the very beginning, there might even be my old posts here somewhere from when I was 11 years old in middle school ranting about how when I grow up I will never be able to date any girl because im indian, AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE 100% TRUE. Women fundamentally are repulsed by every single feature we have and I dont even blame them, I know im genetic filth and accept it. Im 22 now, and you know what, before I become a total loser, im just going to end it ESPECIALLY SINCE I ALREADY HAD ANOTHER INDIAN FRIEND OF MINE I WAS TALKING TO ON REDDIT KILL HIMSELF RECENTLY. His user name was \"Skorpz\". He even made the local news, he jumped off his college dorm room and was declared dead at the scene. And thats my motivation, because I already have a reddit friend who actually did it. I got depressed for quite a while after I found out what happened, and it looks like im going to go for it too.This world was designed to be rigged against anyone who looks like me, and our people historically were losers who were slaves to muslims and brits for 800 years and never fought back once. Just knowing in descended from such pathetic people and that I am indian just makes it so I cant even sleep at night anymore. Im done with this. I am stuck in a body that I do not like, and have nothing in common with. But the problem is that I cannot escape it or modify it much. Its like being stuck with a crappy car and not being able to get rid of it. IT SUCKS, and ive decided that I do not plan to live out the rest of my life in this stupid indian body. Ive already self harmed and damaged myself to quite a lot as well. I usually bash myself in the face with a bat whenever I fly into my rages. Usually until my face is swollen and eyes blackened, I'll hit myself until I just cant take anymore and collapse in a little puddle of my own blood. But the sick thing is that, I ENJOY IT, I actually hate myself so much that I enjoy seeing my stupid indian face beaten, swollen and bleeding in the mirror. Its like the greatest gratification ever, so yes, I guess I do qualify as mentally ill at this point, and dont dare say \"get help\" because I already did that, and its a total joke! I like the thought of being dead and no longer having to be indian. I could just be nothing finally. Or even better, be reborn as a non indian person. That would be an ultimate dream! Because im not going to find any happiness in this life and in this indian body, it just isnt going to happen. Especially since all the indian girls also love making fun of us, saying they will never date an indian guy, white worship, saying we are worthless and that they would rather be single forever than be with an indian guy. You know, that shit HURTS. It really hurts more than anyone could imagine when women of your own race say stuff like that. And if you are an indian girl reading this, I hope that you are happy! I know you think of us as worthless, ugly, shit skinned, sub humans who have no feelings and are not good enough for you, but we do feel just as much as yo do, and when you say stuff like that, its enough to break every last bit of confidence and self worth a stupid indian guy like me has. SO I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE! I hope you get your sick gratitude from it, because you've succeeded in getting rid of us one by one by pushing us to death. The media praises indian women as being \"exotic and beautiful\" and oppressed by evil indian guys on the other hand who are the beta nerd worthless gas station workers like Apu. After all indian women have won more beauty pageants than any other country apparently. ITS JUST AWFUL HOW THINGS ARE FOR US! Why does it have to be this way!?!?! I never did anything wrong to hurt anyone, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME??? WHY IS THE WORLD SO HELLBENT ON CRUSHING US AND SPITTING US BACK OUT!Well, with that being said, I guess in a few hours none of that will matter anymore. I'll either be in heaven or hell, or maybe best case scenario reborn as a man of another race, or even better, reborn as an indian woman at least. Worst case scenario im reincarnated AS ANOTHER INDIAN GUY! I'd rather be reborn as a cockroach than be indian all over again I fucking swear! Indian men are treated lower than cockroaches! We are lower than dirt for fucks sake! I hope you all feel satisfied that you've driven someone to the breaking point. Someone who you never even gave a chance all because of his stupid race. I hope you are all happy with what you've done ridiculing an entire group of people and using us as punching bags so much that we just dont even want to live anymore. So goodbye and good riddance! In just a few hours the hands that typed this will be cold and dead, and im alone in India somewhere now, and nobody knows where I am. So I'll leave you with a bit of poetry that really sums up my existence written by Joseph Merrick the most deformed man to ever walk the earth. He said: \"I know my form is rather odd, but blaming me is blaming god, could I create myself anew I would not fail in pleasing you\". ---This is aatpacalypse97 signing off for the last time. :(","339":"Hi. Again.I have been \"pro\" suicide since like six years. I'm 21. Dad died when I was young. I have a lovely awesome stepdad but unfortunately I can only see him at weekends(work).Both my parents are good. They try their best. But you know the generation gap... It's never enough.Also, I got dumped a month or so ago.Reasons:1) My girlfriend was my anchor. I accepted life was difficult, to say the least, but I was willing to be strong as long as I had a family with her.Call me immature... Fine. But if possible, not to my face. I have already heard it.2) Parents. They shouldn't be here... It's not their fault. But, yes, they UNKNOWINGLY did contribute. More communication would've helped.But it's okay. They're human. To err is to be human. I do not blame them.3) Indian society. I get good grades, ok? So people just push more and more... Cuz \"abcdef32\" has so much potential.It's fine when I can handle it. But I've shown that I like other stuff too!! But, the push is mostly still towards studies.Like, if  I'm working on a college magazine + a club + some college computer Extracurricular stuff that professors personally asked me to do after college...I'm still expected to score the same.But if it was someone else, eh... They just need to pass. It's unfair. I get it, don't get me wrong. I know the \"potential\" thing. I DID get the grades.But I have my limits and I did tell them. But nope.So, college professors and my colleagues... Just the society in general.3a) Girlfriend's parents. They were a major reason for the breakup. They knew about us for five years but still didn't say a word and when it was time to graduate, they just broke us up. Why? Cuz I eat McDonald's chicken burger.LITERALLY that's the reason. India.4) My own head.I have OCD. Or at least my psychologist said I had it a few years ago and I still think I do. I don't know. Again, please don't judge.I think a lot. Too much. That's the MAIN reason I'm here. Too much thinking. Too little acting.5) Media and internetThis could be 4a but fuck it... Vikings, GoT, Stranger Things... Even shows like friends and HIMYM... They make me depressed. OBVIOUSLY, it's not same for everyone. It's my perception of the shows.My \"sensitivity\". And that would have been fine had I had a goal in life. But no. I have no direction.Same for internet... I get so sad sometimes. Just watching LinusTechTips made me depressed. Wow.6) People taunting\/judging meAgain, could be 4b... But no, some things deserve their own category.All my life, I've been called a topper. People come to me when they need help for their studies and then they leave. On a normal day, I'm kind of no one, to everyone.They judged my depression. You too... Reddit. I've been told that I'm not depressed. Just... \"Mild\".Only once has a real doctor said I had depression. And that too, \"mild\". Whilst another psychiatrist said I was irrational... Comparing my mental thoughts to a person who needed kidney transplant. Like wtf.Everyone has their issues. Just cuz you're(generalizing) worse off doesn't mean that I can't be in a similar position for different reasons!!7) Dead dadI was six. Traumatizing. More so cuz no one involved me in the funeral rites and later on too... It's like his image was just buried by my mom and my brother.He worked very hard for his job. He wanted to help people. And he passed that thought onto me and that brings me to number 8.8) My previous dreamI want to help people. Wanted to. Want to. I don't know.I wanted... That people who were depressed... I could understand them. Especially teenagers. Try and help. Just show them that what they're feeling is not \"inhuman\"... \"Irrational\"... That they're not alone. That someone else has gone through it.But I didn't take that field. Fine. I still wanted to help. Be it tiny things like helping those college students..Just help. But, as time went on, I see... Life is such a shitty playground. My dad took his work home with him... The stress was a lot. And I'm the same. Stress + OCD is a lot for me, at least.I cannot help. Even if I want to. If I do help, I'll just kill myself... Slowly. Cuz that's what the stress does. Slow suicide.9) Future careerI wanna move. US or Canada. I don't know what I'll do. I heard it's very competitive.I cannot handle a single entrance exam of fucking India... How am I supposed to handle USA's exams? USA's students? I can't... I'll fucking be an idiot. Good grades\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260good skills.I can't talk to people my own age.I can't talk on phone.I can't even order food.I don't think I have any scope whatsoever. Be it psychology or my current profession...10) PharmacyYeah, I'm in pharmacy. It's good.Or at least, it was. I thought I'd get to help people. But no, it's sitting behind a desk taking meds off the shelf and dispensing... Mostly.Helping is a tiny part. Teeny tiny. 1%.I hate it now. I loved it in the beginning when it was all... Introductory. But as years go by, you realise the actual jobs available and you see that they all are basically desk jobs. Some being industrial... And no, I don't call making meds or discovering new drugs \"helping\".At least, not MY helping. I want to help a HUMAN directly. It is helping sure... Working in industry is helping. But just, not how I want to.11) SexI love anal. I love BDSM. Submission and domination. As a male, I love being fucked.Gay. Bisexual.I love boobs. I love girls. But can't cum during sex. Would like to suck a dick. Try it, at least.Gay?I love a clean vagina. Bi?I don't know. Again, Indian here... People at the age of 20... They were fucking booing our government for legalizing gays. And these are SMART well mannered, well raised people.I don't care for their opinion as much... But I do care cuz it doesn't allow me to express. If I talk, it's pointless. That's all.12) HealthI have epilepsy. I had depression. Or have. I had\/have OCD.Constantly suicidal. Anxiety.My stomach and intestines feel like years of fast food have rotten them. As a pharmacist, I should be smarter... But no, I keep eating junk.My penis burns sometimes after I cum and I need to pee together.Lots of needs to pee. Basically, both holes are malfunctioning.My legs hurt. Joints hurt. Mom has arthritis. Grandma had joint issues. It could pass.I know it may look like I'm a hypochondriac but a)I doubt anyone is still reading and b) I'm just assuming and lastly c) I'm a fucking human and I'm fucking scared so cut me some slack.I'm not making some definitive statement. Just... My health has always had issues. Right eye is bad.Also I have keloids on the back. And one small one on the nose.So again, overall it FEELS like a slow suicide.13) Nope. This isn't 13 Reasons why. 12 is the last one.To conclude, suicide is never a result of ONE singular thing. It's always a multiple of things. That's what I believe.So take any reason. Say no. 5... I don't even remember what it was. But take that alone and nope, that's not why I'm killing myself by jumping. It's 1+2+...+12. It's all TOGETHER that I have given up.Eh. Those are the reasons. Do you want the wishes? I bet not... Who has even read this far?***If anyone has... List of wishes is shorter... \"Reasons to live\", eh?These are mine. But they apply to you too if you're living. If you want to make me happy after my death... You can help me by doing this. But... Otherwise, it's just a list of my reasons to live.1) Movies and TV ShowsPlease watch Avengers: Endgame. Vikings final season. GoT final season.Won't force anyone to watch 13 Reasons... If you can watch it till it ends... Good but you don't have to.2) GamesPlay Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. Enjoy it. And once in a while, just sit in the car and watch the sun set.3) SexFigure out the lines between gay, bi and straight.And above all, enjoy sex.4) The OneGet that girl back. Or find that girl. And hold on tight, and never let go.5) FamilyImprove communications, if you have the strength which I never did.6) FoodTaste some beef, bacon... Spaghetti, pizzas other than Domino's, some burgers NOT in McDonald's... And let me know.Cuz all that stuff is unavailable in my city.7) Idiot.Try drugs once. No injections.Try smoking once.Try all drinks once.Try it all... Once. Otherwise, why live?Again, for me, those things are unachievable tonight.8) TechnologyLet me know when VR+ AR(MR) is consumer feasible for Skyrim and Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk.Let me know when phones become good again.Let me know when tech becomes affordable in India(maybe that's reason no. 13 to die...)I think that's it.***Conclusion...I was going to die today. But I didn't want to face my dad and my brother. Maybe tomorrow when I have an exam where for the first time in my life, I haven't read a single word.Look, I'm not faking. Today, tomorrow. Hopefully never!! BUT... I don't see the chance.And the mods said the 3 days rule, right??? That wait for 3 days?? Well, I've waited. I've been thinking and preparing for more than a week now. And that's just the \"active\" part.It has been in my head since six years. So please don't fucking play with me by saying \"wait for a year, you're young\".At 30, you're young. 40 is older. Why die?At 25, you're young. At 60 too you're fucking young.I'm 21. I know I am young. But I also trust my instincts. Above all the people in the world, I would know me the most, no??***Look, just, conclusion 2:I MIGHT die soon. I've written all my notes and said almost all my goodbyes.Except for you. Reddit. So this is me, saying goodbye and goodnight.I hope... I hope I post on reddit after a week and a month and a year. I don't particularly wish to die. But, I do \"love\" to stop life. I do think I'm too weak to continue.And look, if it's any comfort to you... I read on the internet or some doctor told me... The people who talk most about suicide never do it. So maybe I'm just one of those fakers, yeah?Sigh... I know. I know it's not faking. But those doctors... Licensed registered psychiatrists... They told me this at such a fucking age where puberty is ending and \"adulthood\" is beginning when the cement was settling. It just got in and I can never get it out. (Reason no.6)As for YOU... I hope your 2019 is better. If I can help you in any way... I will try. But I doubt I have the energy. Look, man... Or woman... Thanks for reading. Even if you only read the ending.If I don't post... Just... Reddit is included in reason no.5. BUT, still... I am so thankful I had you guys with your silly memes and mostly awesome community.- L'altro Lato.","340":"Don't know where to start. About to turn 42(M), wife (39\/F) and I are addicted to heroin for about 2.5 years now, \"functioning addicts\" with jobs, but its quickly becoming dysfunctional as our habits have gotten more expensive than we can afford, so I've ended up selling most of my beloved items that were worth anything (guitars\/studio equipment\/etc.) and we still can't make ends meet with this. We started on it shortly after hearing my sister in law who we were extremely close to had a rare malignant form of breast cancer. She passed away in July at age 36. My father (67\/M) also just passed away out of nowhere 3 weeks ago. My job sucks, it's something they (a managed services company) moved me to when the company I was hired to do much higher level support for ended their contract with my company to relocate support to India back last spring, so they moved me to this role so as not to lose me, but it's way way beneath me, stuff I was doing 15+ years ago and had moved way past in my career. I've had 5 bosses in the time I've been there and the new one absolutely hates me for some reason and micromanages me to death, harping on things like being 2 minutes late from my 30-minute allowed lunch, and ignoring the fact that I kick ass on calls, we're handling 70% of the calls vs. the Indian helpdesk counterpart when all we're required to do it 51% and I constantly get accolade emails from customers to the bosses, but never hear a peep about that, or staying 40 minutes late on a call or anything, just stuff like being 2 minutes late coming back from lunch.&amp;#x200B;Add to this I used to find meaning in my life from making music and being creative and such but I've lost basically all drive to do this anymore.

I tried getting on subs months ago but even after 24 hours they made me immediately go into accute withdrawl which is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I'd rather die than experience that again (ended up scoring dope to make it stop).

I try to talk her out of it everyday and almost everyday I succeed.. but today she told me that she jumped in front of the tracks and luckily someone called the cops on her and she was saved, but luck can't keep factoring every time. Is there any suicide hotline or something I can contact to from India to get help to her? She has denied going to a therapist to get help.Any online help \/ prevention site can also be helpful too. Please, I don't know where else to turn. ","343":"17M here.The whole getting 'black-pilled' thing dates back to 2 months ago. I moved to Germany for college from India, installed Tinder, got a date with a girl.\\[Not exactly a date,I was just looking for friends\\].We agreed to meet up,She did'nt seem interested and just blocked me after the date. I got into thinking what could the reason be. Then I don't know how I stumbled into this Black-Pill stuff,I watched FaceAndLMS's video on YT,got horribly depressed. My confidence took a huge hit, to the point where it's non-existent now. I have most other things in life in order. I have my own business, I am self-dependent since age 16. Now since I have stumbled into all this stuff, I don't have any more ambition. I just want to die ASAP. Life seems hopeless. No matter whats possible for me to do , it seems like it all comes down to genetics and being good looking. I didn't buy all this in the begining but it started to make more sense. I looked up stats of online dating, especially stuff like response rate by race and got more discouraged. Got over it for a few days, then met a girl again.Went on a date with her.Everything went well. After going on the second date she was like 'I just like korean guys and white guys, sorry'. I accepted that I'm always going to be single after that but the things that concerns me the most are how it's gonna affect my career. I read up more Black Pilled stats and found out that being succesful has a lot to do with your appearance too. You can get away with a lot more, get more favours etc. I don't know if it's just the wormhole effect but now all the BP stuff seems real and if i come up with anything to reason against that, it just seems like I'm denying reality.It may sound stupid and might seem like I'm a whiny little teenager who cries about everything but believe me it's not.I've faced hardships in life.I've had been working hard since I was 13,can say that I wasted my childhood, avoided wasting time, haven't watched TV\/Movies\/ or any other stuff people do to enjoy so that I could focus on creating the life I always wanted to live but you can't cheat Biology.I can fix every other thing like Money ,Status but as far as the stuff I've seen now ,I'm fixated on the viewpoint that looks are everything in life. I searched up on people like Jeremy Meeks,he was a felon,never did shit in his life, but just because of his looks, had women raise a campaign to pay for his bail, got donations from them, became a millionaire ,cheated on his wife, had the daughter of a billionaire fall in love with him,got married and is still admired by women. So why even try when it's all about genetics :(.You can still look up on his instagram and find out that women are drooling over him. Guess it's his 'Personality'.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;","344":"I feel like my killing myself to stop being a burden, the thing that's stopping me is my dog whose alone with me at home since my mom is gone for a month and a girl who I asked out, who politely told me that's she not ready for it yet, so I don't want her to feel guilty and blame herself if I die, and it also feels like I've lost a good friend, which is her because of that since she takes a lot of time to even reply to me anymore or seems not interested when she does, I feel like I fucked up by doing this.I feel like I'm being a burden to my single mom whose struggling to earn for herself and here I am, a graduate whose just recently got a job from a family friend but hasn't received their appointment letter yet nor has the salary being discussed but I'm supposed to start next week but to get to the place, I need to spend money daily since I haven't gotten a vehicle yet, I need 6$ daily when converted to U.S dollars which isn't a lot for you folks, but over here, it is.I've been buying groceries and food for me and my dog using my mom's money which has been almost depleted by now and I don't even have enough money to feed myself and can feed only my dog and I don't want my mom to know because it would hurt her deeply and she'll feel guilty since she's struggling to support us and would blame herself for being out of town for months.  I've been lying to her telling that her that I'm doing fine and eating well. I also had a serious eye infection which has also depleted a lot of money from her account, I'm even afraid to refill the medicines again because even that would cost money.I don't want to tell my best friends too, because I don't want them to pity me or feel sad for me and lend me money because they have problems themselves and I don't want to add another one to the list.I don't know what to do, everyday I get scared of the future, am I going to survive? Am I going to have enough money and security to care for my mom like she did for me? Will I ever pay her back for what she has done for me, as a single mother? Why am I being a burden to her? Why am I so confused, should I just kill myself to stop being a burden and to not go to sleep every night, with these thoughts in my head?I'm 21 and I reside in India and I'm not from the States or Europe.","345":"I have been a law abiding ,honest and hard working person until today.

I am basically fed up from this world which obviously has been so cruel so far, there are good people off-course but I am finding it hard to be in company of those. So, last year my girl friend decided to move to Canada, I too following her started that dream to go there and settle (By the way I am from India), it's too tough, first you have to score good in IELTS, then you need funds (bigger then my life savings so far) to receive a PR. But, I decided to do it all, preparing for IELTS, next month have an exam of that, don't really know if I will be able to crack it or not. Still having lot's and lot's of doubts in my mind, weather I will be able to get a job there or not, even the smallest job possible. I am currently working as a web developer but due to moving in different country and without having their education degree, I understand I will not get my ideal job easily. Now, I am fine with even cleaning dishes in restaurants absolutely no issue related to ego.But the problem is , I am suffering from stammering so quite not sure will I get some basic job there or not which will not require speaking, and will the employer hire a stammerer or not :(Overall, It's all messed up, I really don't know what will I do next, as my stammering is always there to push my mind in a negative side that I won't be able to achieve anything in life. Plus girlfriend want to merry next year itself, I am not making much to feed her and obviously after going there I don't know what will I make, I am getting mentally harassed by her on daily basis now when you will merry and this is creating hell of load in my mind. Above all , having below average IQ is a big problem too in my life. Obviously I am not considering suicide but these thoughts have started coming recently and am afraid my life will keep on being messy. At the end, I don't have anyone to share this problems, so decided to share here. Have a good day ahead and thanks for being so kind to give it a read.

I am jobless today in a foreign land surviving on the last couple dollars I have and I keep getting rejected at job interviews. And for the record I have a masters in Electrical Engineering, something that I am not so passionate about but was hoping to switch careers once I gained my grounding here in the US.

I found out that basically my intense feverdreams and intuition were right, if I move to a place without air pollution, I could be as good as cured.In 6 weeks where I live will be clouded in smog from old years eve. This smog stays for about a week. Factually, the pollution is higher than an ordinary day in China and as high if not higher than India's Diwali. Figures of more than 2400 particulate matter has been reached. Half that is no exception, even in rural areas.I dont expect to live. With 60 particulate matter I am already inflamed to the point of too breathless to talk and spinal cord inflammation producing so much pain and seizures.There is an article about MCAS that describes it as basically an electrified full body suit and the worst stomach flu ever. That is how I live by 120-150PM.When I was in Spain near an oil refinery \\[on an eco reserve of al places!\\], it was 600PM and I was in the worst hell of my life, cant put it into words...After 4 days I had to leave. What if it is more than double that, and I cant leave? Yeah  am not expecting to live but die a brutal, brutal death.Suicide is kinder.If only I had the money to evacuate myself, it isnt even that much. Just around 1000 euros and 3000 to get to the safe place. But my friends dont understand and those who do are too poor to help. Feels like such a low amount of money to die over. People spend more on chemo therapy and rife machines daily...Anyway, earth is fucked up. 90% of people live in polluted air says WHO, 1 in 7 premature deaths is due to pollution and soon, whichever way unless I get evacuated, I will be 1 of them.","353":"I hail from a small village in India.I am autistic ,a low functioning autistic [person.](https:\/\/person.My)Nobody in area understands me .No one is educated enough to understand what autism [is](https:\/\/is.My).

Here goes my story -I am a guy in mid-20s in India of a typical middle class family. I have always been overly emotional and a chronic overthinker which has abated significantly in recent years. Perhaps due to my upbringing or nature, I am not a very chilled out person who would love to play games or do anything which most other people do. Most of the time, I am immersed in my current goal be it of office or personal goal. For example, I was trying to get fit sometime back and I did it by focusing completely on it. Completing my goals has never been an issue for me.However, my problem is with people. Due to being shy and introverted, I have few friends and those are not emotionally close to me. That does not mean that I won\u2019t be called for hanging out or if I visit them then they won\u2019t meet me. In fact, I have travelled much with these people. But the issue is with emotional connection with them. They would never share any personal details with me. Probably a few laughs here and there but the emotional part is very less.I see my friends respecting others and wanting to hang out with them but with me they are reticent. That might be because of difference in personalities. There was also a very close female friend of mine for whom I cared a lot and even care a lot now. But I never got the same respect and affection as she had for others in her life. She does consider me a very good friend but only until more extroverted people come along and outshine me.I am pretty depressed and suicidal for some time now. I don\u2019t know how to become extroverted or chilled out in life. I even went to a therapist but it was of no use. I am just waiting for time to heal the broken things.Thank you folks for reading me till the end. It\u2019s much appreciated.","355":"I am 21 y\/o and i am from india, so sorry if i make some mistakes. so the idea to commit suicide was in my mind for the last 1 year or so (since 3rd june 2017 to be exact). but yesterday it was enough for me and i have made up my mind now to kill myself. i dont have figured out the way to kill myself but i will figure it out today or best tomorrow.(if you have any suggestion please do share). now coming to my reason of committing suicide are my parents. so as i said previously, i am from india, so in india there is a thing called culture which grants basically infinite powers to parents to do whatever shit and get out by saying we are thinking the best about you. which means they can be verbally abusive, physically abusive, control whatever you do in life, whom you meet or not. and remember i said i am 21. yes i am still living with them even when i am 21 and not bcoz i am incompetent or a pussy but bcoz my elder brother is out in a different city to do job and they couldn't just let me go even when i had the life changing oppourtunities in the past but they just said no and guilt trapped me by saying i dont think about them or all i care about is me. also i have a brother and last time i saw him was a year and half ago and the thing i remember is me telling him all my problems and him saying just let it go bcoz they are my parents and i cant do anything about it. and my mother is also the same. whenever something happens, her answer son just forget about it and move on. even when my father verbally abuses me, when he call shits like disgrace, sisterfucker, a mistake, to forget about it, even when he beats me whenever he is angry, to forget about it. and if you still dont get it, my father is a verbal and a physical abuser. remember when i said i had a life changing oppourtunity and they guilt trapped me to give it up just bcoz it meant living in a different city. yeah the point my father made was that we are financially not viable enough to handle expenses of me living in a different city. basically we are poor. and we are. we are not a very wealthy, just barely getting food on the tables. so my dad had no money to sent me away. not enough to put food on the table but enough to buy a bottle of rum every single day and get drunk and then after shouting on me for no reason go to sleep. to give you an example yesterday and even today my father verbally abused me just bcoz i was going to the library to study. to give you a context, my father doesn't like me to go outside to libraries or other places to study bcoz he thinks i am making excuses to get out of the house to hang out with my friends. but in reality all i want is peace and in my house i just cant get it bcoz of all the things that happened. so coming back to the story, he did not want me to go. so what he would've said  *son dont go to the library* NO...... he said (and i am paraphrasing except the cussing and all the threats) *you motherfucker, piece of shit. what do you want to show by doing these things. you wanna teach us huh?!?! sisterfucker. huh?!!! i mean you never grow up. nobody is going anywhere!!!! and if i see you leave this house i am gonna break your legs!!!!* what was i trying to teach??? i dont know... it was my daily routine to get ready by 10 in the morning and then leave for the library but yesterday i dont know what happened but yes it was this. and today too he did the same thing on the same topic just adding a few new abuses and new more threats like bastard and he is gonna shoot me.there are more things about my father and my family but i think this all sums up why i am doing this. bcoz this is just one incident. i have been going through these things my whole life. so yes i have decided to kill me. just dont know how?? as soon as that is figured out i will do it. (again if you have any ideas how to do it plz do share.)","356":"I am 18 and have been subjected to a ridiculous situation . I have very few friends and go to college where people are friendly but not close friends . I have been in a weird mindset lately because I\u2019ve lived with my mum and dad . It started out really great but then they stopped talking to me . We stopped making good conversation and they started complaining like stereotypical old people . At one point my dad didn\u2019t put up a canvas picture and my mum said they should see other people . A ridiculous and hilarious situation . Also I realised that while everyone else was making money and spending time with friends I was still only working four hours a week which was nothing in comparison to the 20 hours a week I would\u2019ve or could\u2019ve worked . No one seems to care that I could of been so much more financially independent . I have been in a ridiculous situation . Whenever I was with my family we did boring slow paced activities that my parents wanted to do such as take long walks . As a young 18 year old it would have been better if I did more lively things . But obviously I don\u2019t have the friends for that . I have had a three month summer holiday but all I could focus on was my painful haemorrhoids which cause anal bleeding and pain and itchiness and burning sensations just because . \ud83d\ude11 Good news is they\u2019re not severe or life threatening just really painful \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43. I am aware I\u2019m in a ridiculous situation wherein I didn\u2019t do any normal teenager \/ young adult things apart from study and get decent ish grades . But everyone got those grades and got jobs and \/ started driving and \/or entered relationships etc . Also I\u2019m autistic and apparently this can make it harder to form relationships . Overall I\u2019m so done with life , or the lack there of that I\u2019ve been experiencing . I feel betrayed and as an 18 year old adult feel the right that as someone who experiences on and off anal pain ( which the doctor basically said was more so a result of stress than a physical problem when I got them checked when I was 16) and feel like I have a right to die . I either want an amazing life or no life at all . I refuse to be the subject of shitty circumstances or pity or sadness . My family have sat back and let me be a social recluse for three months even though they said I was depressed . All my mum ever does it chat shit about all the racist shit and all the horrific surgeries she\u2019s had growing up in Kenya and India . She is so fucking depressed I get it from her . Everyone else is in this amazing headspace because they are financially independent and have friends and have spent the three month summer holiday having fun which they have shown on snapchat . But obviously they don\u2019t care about me and wouldn\u2019t help if I told them the situation . Furthermore in our first year of college we had very little work . I still didn\u2019t apply for a job or anything even though most of my first year was free time . I think I was depressed before or something maybe . I feel sad I could\u2019ve spent the summer building muscle and not just binging on junk food . I violated my vegan principles by binging on non vegan junk food in my room. I have gained weight and my parents just say or do nothing . Even before I was 18. And my college friends aren\u2019t close enough to me even though we literally did so much to help each other . When one of their sisters were dying we all stopped studying and talked with her . She also has a girlfriend who she met at the beginning of the year . They spent everyday of their lives together for like5 months straight . She knows her family and vice versa . They have become so close and their lives have become so intertwined it\u2019s frustrating to see a relationship flourish in front of you while some days you can\u2019t even walk properly because of the haemorrhoid pain and because you barely have any friends . It\u2019s funny because I could\u2019ve had a better experience but I strongly believe my family\u2019s lack of help or guidance , predisposed genes to feel depressed , a juxtaposition between my experience and other people\u2019s experiences etc has made me so done. I don\u2019t even have a self esteem anymore. I don\u2019t even go to college anymore .  I don\u2019t want to live half the life I could\u2019ve led if I did work out and looked better , or if I got a job earlier and had more money . Even if I continue to live life it\u2019ll be a socially undesirable life because I\u2019m a little chubby and live with my parents . Everyone even now comments on the way I look and the situation I\u2019m in . A lot of my relatives I feel belittle me and my parents definitely don\u2019t take my situation seriously . Other families actually work together but my family is so individually focused . Even on Christmas we just do our own things . I just don\u2019t want to live the life I would live if I do work hard and don\u2019t give up.

I didn't wish to write about suicide there.&gt;I have  a relatively easy life - parents are economically good, I get good grades mostly without studying and I have ok genetics too.This is why whenever I complain I feel really shitty because I feel like the problems I have aren't real problems and I just feel like a spoilt brat but still I need to talk about shit.  Recently, I had been put in a better batch with smarter kids in it.I just see these people around me and some unknown emotion overcomes me.I am not sure whether its jealousy, grief, self-hate. I just see them having a nice time, playing sports, having great social lives, pursuing and excelling in their hobbies and simultaneously outperforming me in tests and exams too. I immediately start feeling shit as I have no hobbies and also my good grades have been a result of good genetics and no hard work.(edited)  &gt;  &gt;In the social aspect, I am not a total 4 chan degenerate. I can hold up a good conversation with anyone for a few minutes. A lot of people think I am funny. I have been told I am very convincing but the thing is I don't enjoy socializing but at the same time I wish to be social. I see these people getting invited to parties, going to places together and I immediately feel like I want this but at the same time I almost hate talking to anyone irl,While people tell me I am funny I almost hate everything that comes out of my mouth and I hate any of the jokes I make.People want me to be their friend, a few girls have told me that I look cute but I still prefer sitting alone and not joining in the group and I simultaneously keep on hating myself for doing this.  I have no hobbies and I have only myself to blame. I have always had a very fast metabolism so I never had any incentive to do sports and I hated the social aspect anyway. I would love to sing or play an instrument but simply can't see myself practicing for hours and hours.The thing though I would like to bring up is that I don't pursue anything If I don't feel like I am naturally better at this than others. I sucked the first when I played drums and I tried many times and still sucked compared to others, so I lost any zeal to learn it. I was shit at painting so I gave it up. I have only myself to blame for my lack of hobbies and now when I see these people doing academics, sports and hobbies simultaneously so much self-hate is generated I immediately stop working and can't get myself to work the whole day(edited)  &gt;  &gt;Stuff that I used to enjoy I stopped enjoying it too. I used to get real joy from playing video games now I hate them. I used to enjoy well.... nothing else but still these days I am just stuck in some deep languor. I watch tv shows or yt videos all day while getting no real enjoyment from it. I have a lot of stuff and work to do but still I waste my time doing this. I guess I don't like confronting the issue so I just beat around the bush  &gt;  &gt;I haven't found real joy doing anything or I haven't liked doing anything since a year or twoMy relationship with my parent's isn't the same anymore. We always had a very guarded relationship where I did not try sharing anything negative with them because it would always end up making myself feel shittier about myself. I have been thinking of killing myself everyday for at least a month and I. I looked online and people said I should open to my parents about it. It completely back-fired. They started saying I am good for nothing and won't be capable of doing anything. My parents basically echoed the thoughts I had been having in my head. My dad told me why can't I be normal like other kids. Why can't I go to school enjoy it, talk to other kids, get good grades, pursue hobbies, play sports. Now I am really serious about killing myself because now I have no one to talk to or fall back to. I have friends but I know none of them are real and good friends. I try to talk to them about this and they just say \"why can't I be happy and normal\". I live in India so any awareness about mental-health is non-existent. My dad refuses to take me to a therapist and I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't done any work in 3 days and I just sleep to numb these feelings.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;","358":"If it wasn't already clear from the username (throwaway) I'm from India and here the pressure is too much.

The 90+% kind. My parents think I'm going to do well in these exams. I don't know how to tell them. I just told my mom I wrote whatever I could remember. I really don't know if I can face their disappointment again. I feel like dying before the results are out. I know people here have things even worse so I was thinking of posting here or not since yesterday evening but now it is just eating me from the inside.  Just wanted to get it out. Thanks for reading. I hope your day goes better.","359":"I'll be honest and I take complete responsibility for below par performances, and failing in an entrance exam twice. Being an average student in India is being a liability to your family. I didn't have such bad performances before, until last 3 years. I hastily took Science( Maths and Engineering) after 10th grade to avoid spending huge amount of money for tuitions. I loathe myself for not thinking it over properly. I failed twice, and am now only eligible for a new non-engineering and a local college with no countrywide recognition, no job prospects . And I didn't fair well into other exams either. I did as much as I could do, but it wasn't enough. It always look liked fighting a losing battle. I do not have much options in my hand. I have developed a dislike for engineering and I can't get on board doing it now. I want to pursue non-technical fields like law, business administration and journalism, and to pursue I can give their entrances next year which would mean spending another year in home, considering I fell just short of clearing their entrances. Another thing with that is if you have difference of two years between your school and under graduation, you are overlooked for college placements, and any promising job in general. The society isn't kind to you at all if you are 18 and have no college. I have let my parents down massively, twice. I can't afford to do it once again. I feel miserable for letting them down and dashing their hopes, time and time again.  My mother feels that my life is looking more and more destined to not be great, unlike kids she teaches and kids of her colleague, who all made it to good colleges. She avoids talking to anybody about me, because it will be embarrassing.It really hurts me. Sometimes I can't sleep enough or sometimes I sleep a lot. My distant family isn't close, they only care about their success in their lives, look down to those who aren't mighty. I'm alone in this. I can't see the look of disappointment and embarrassment on the faces of my parents, anymore. I can't bear anymore of \" why can't you do better ?\" or \"why are you like this?\" . There have been plenty of moments where I just wanted to run away and just end it all, but I can't. I cannot live and be a waste of space. I'm sorry. ","360":"I am 14 years old and in 9th grade. I love going to school and being in band because I am with people who like me and appreciate me much more than my parents ever will.Today is graduation and the band is playing there. I really wanted to go, as tomorrow is the last day of school and it will be the last time that I'll see my senior friends. My dad got home from work and I asked him to take me and he immediately starts yelling at me. Even though I begged to him, he got a belt and threatened to hit my with the buckle, as he has done many times.We immigrated here from India almost 10 years ago and recently got naturalized. Right now, they are in the process of getting my passport made. My parents always threaten that they'll stop the process and get me deported even though I'm here legally.I've told them multiple times that they make me want to kill myself and have even threatened to do it. All they say is \"go ahead\" and that their lives will be better without me. They've even said that they regret not throwing me out on the streets when I was younger.I really feel like my friends and teachers are much better than my parents, and they are a lot more supportive too. During FBLA this year, I didn't place at States, and my friends said things like \"there's always next year\" and \"you'll do better next time\". When my parents found out, they called me a worthless piece of shit and told me to get out of the house.Now, they are trying to make me quit band, even though that's probably the only time I get to have fun and not worry about anything. Whenever I tell them things such as my friends' parents are much better than them, or my teachers are way more nice, they say why don't you go live with them. They also beat me for getting mad. They push me completely past the breaking point and when I act out even a tiny bit they lose their shit. They lie to their extended family that \"I'm a danger to them\" or \"I have anger issues\". Whenever I'm alone with them they constantly berate me. Everyday when my dad drives me to school he won't shut the fuck up about how much he hates me. My mom has no patience at all and when I don't do what she wants right away, she hits me with whatever she can find. My dad has tried to choke me multiple times, and whenever I push him away they make a big deal about it. They always talk about how I should be cultured and have respect. I just want to say to them that Indian culture is a piece of shit. They have forced me to hate my heritage. I wish that I wasn't Indian. I fucking hate all the cultural bullshit they force me to do. I've threatened to call the police or something similar and they always hit me and say that I'm an ungrateful person. Since 8th grade I really don't want to live with them. I am usually really good at hiding my emotions at school and to this day, I haven't told anyone about what goes on at home. I am sure that they don't treat me the same as all of my friends get treated by their parents. They've pushed me to the edge so much that I constantly feel like I have no will to live. It just feels so good to get all this off my chest. And finally, to anyone that reads this: thank you so much for taking the time out of your day for a random person in the internet.","361":"So I am 17 and have been appearing for a lot of entrance tests for various colleges right now. In my country, India one exam particularly \\(JEE\\) the 2nd most \"prestigious\" exams to get into some national level colleges and also to qualify for writing the most prestigious exam of our country \\(IIT\\). &amp;nbsp;So I \\(and almost 1 million other people\\) have been preparing for this exam from the past 2 years. In my first year, after 3 months I was put in a \"toppers only class\" kind of thing. That is when it all went downhill, I couldn't cope up, I lost interest and pretty much flunked my first year. I was shifted to the normal class for the 2nd year and I again started performing good. There were ups and downs but it was satisfactory to say the least.&amp;nbsp;Then it was around Jan'2018 when the classes stopped so everyone was doing self\\-study for the next 3\\-4 months. It was during these months that I tried to learn my first year matter because this exam \\(jEE\\) has the course spreading over grade 11 and 12. So I tried, but I started loosing interest and just got distracted every time i sat down to study. My mum, goes to work so I was o=pretty much alone at home for near about 12 hours and could not study anything even when I tried to. It got to the point that I invited my grandparents so there would be someone at home to monitor me but I just couldn't study.&amp;nbsp;My mum was pretty supporting and used to tell me not to get tensed and that if everything goes bad she would get me a seat in her companies University \\(The company she works for is in the education industry\\). I somehow studied for the last month and was feeling okayish about this exam. &amp;nbsp;Then the exam came and it wasn't good, but I expected I would qualify for the main exam and kind of knew I wouldn't be getting a good college that were given based on the scores of this exam. My mum, checked my paper that night, despite both of us agreeing that we would wait for the results. I then gave an examination for a private university 4 days later which is kinda easier than the other paper. 10 days after that I gave 2 more entrance exams which were okayish but I was never gonna go to those 2.&amp;nbsp;The results came for the first private exam and I did bad \\(got 20k rank out of 200,000\\) then  the \\(JEE\\) results came and I absolutely shit the bed. I couldn't even qualify for the main exam \\(74 was the cut\\-off and I got 70\\) . My three other friends \\(we foour studied together in my 2nd year and were very good students, not the best but still very good\\) had bad performances as well but 1 qualified due to reserved seats and other qualified by 2 marks \\(76\\).&amp;nbsp;I still have 2 major exams left but I am just not finding in me the guy who used to study religiously. I resort to staring at the wall for hours rather than studying from the book kept in front of me. I have lost all hope and am unable to do anything. My mum, is pissed at me all the time and i get scoldings everyday. No\\-one understands how hard it is for me to study and I seriously try to do it. My dad \\( lives in other state, due to job\\) doesn't help my case either. He just blames me for not studying and I can't say anything. I am like that happy, friendly and comic\\-relief guy in your friends group who is always happy but nowadays i am just sad all the time and don't feel like living.&amp;nbsp;P.S. Sorry, for the long post but I needed to get it out. Any help\/motivation to study \\(I have 25 days before my last major exam and have the ability to do good\\) would be appreciated.","362":"I'm an excellent student a role model to all ,Monitor of my class ,  I use to be those ' my only goal in life was to go study abroad in Japan ' That was the motivating force that changed  me from a fat ass chubby to a good looking person .However   the dream of japan Is facing a threat , I have made up my mind to not to go college and start working for a university in Japan . My parents are supportive but not that rich , the dreaded when the heard the cost of  studying in Japan which was 27 lakhs This maybe wrong value , I don't know about it .I'm from India and is willing to study in Japan , I learnt japanese and all And thought the cost of japan was just 3.5 lakhs a month  , however I don't know any longer is this my lack of research ?

No one else knows about this because he has confided in me alone. I cant approach any mutual friends , as if he finds out, he will stop contacting me too, and based on our last communication, he is certainly prepared to kill himself in next 24 hours His parents are not very understanding and I am scared that contacting them can lead to something worse as he is already on the edge I feel helpless What do i do?? (location, india)","364":"I am a 20 year old female living in india. My mom from my chidhood always compares me with my friends and relatives and always says how ugly i look. I have low self esteem and low confidence from my childhood and no matter how many times i build my confidence and self esteem, she always break me down and pushes me to depression again. I am always trying to be optimistic but most of the time it's not working. I have no fear of public speaking before but i feel too insecure now a days and i am scared to even go out of my house. I have a habit of comparing myself to others i don't know how to stop it. I am a very average student in education.when i finished my higher education(i was so naive and stupid), i wanted to take nutrition and dietitics course but she blacked mailed me and made me choose biotechnology and now i can't even shift my career. It really makes me feel low. Recently i failed in my entrance for post graduation(believe me she always don't let me study in home, she always disturbs me and makes sure i am not studying) and made some mistakes in joining another college, so i took a year break. I got hypothyroidism(i got it because of my excessive stress and depression) (i always study while she is sleeping at night)  which made me gain some weight and she calls me fat now and seborrhic dermatitis because of this my hair looks bad and she mocks me for that too. But when i confront her saying this, she tells me she loves me(does she really love me?).  I don't have any friends too and i have serious trust issues because of my childhood sexual abuse by a person i called brother near my house. I overcame depression caused by that by alone but now a days it's so hard and i feel too impure and ugly.She considers me as burden and asks me get married and go away(arrange marraige) but i don't want to marry. I even tried to commit suicide at one point but something made me stop, then i realized i am a coward in dying too. My father is good to me but i don't think he is good to my mother in their days of early marraige but now he is fine , the only reason i live is him but i can't share these things with him, i am scared he will end up hating me. I am sure i won't share these with my dad because my moom is rude to my dad too and i know their marraige is a failure. Both of them don't like each other, but for the sake of society they are staying together.I just don't know how to end my life, it's hell everyday. Moving out is not possible in my country. Did anyone experienced situation like mine and fortunately overcome it? Please help me. ","365":"This is a very long jumble of text. I just feel like my whole life, things have just built on top of each other. I don't even think a single therapist has heard all of the shit I think about. I feel like everything in my life haunts me. And nobody takes it seriously because I need to hit rock bottom first. I don't seem like I need help because I have gotten okay at covering it up. But people around me know I feel this way. It just seems like I am not broken enough for help. But I am. I grew up in a family of four. My parents are immigrants. I have an older brother. He has severe autism and I think my dad expects me to take care of him after they are gone. I can barely take care of myself and I want to move out of the area which I could not with my brother. I don't know how I would hold down a job yet pay someone to take care of him and take care of myself. It means the rest of my life would be dedicated to my brother, not me. I couldn't get married. I am already scared to have kids in case they are autistic. The cultural gap in my family is hard. My mom struggling with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression while insisting on no treatment meant hell for my childhood. 7 year old me spilling a glass of milk meant I got screamed at for the rest of the day. Banshee screaming about how I am a waste of space, stupid, worthless, etc. This goes on for hours in stages. If you say anything, it starts again. My mom has threatened my dad with a knife. She refuses to take any medication. In one of her episodes, she took me and my autistic brother to a homeless shelter because she was convinced my dad was evil. My dad said he went after her as soon as he could but I think part of him wanted to just leave us there. I always prayed for the day my parents would get divorced. They were toxic for each other. My dad has severe anger issues. It just worsened throughout the course of my life. One time, he went to visit his family in India. I was seven and my mom was getting incredibly upset. She broke off a drawer in the kitchen and threatened to hit me with it, nudging it on my shoulder. I called 911 crying. The police officers came. My mom acted somewhat normal but said I was misbehaving. The drawer was on the ground, broken off. They said it was my fault because I misbehaved. They asked if my severely autistic brother was okay. And in that decision I made a choice. Because I heard what happens to people like my brother in the system. And my parents had money. She didn't hurt my brother but I realized that what my brother could potentially go through much worse in the governmental system. They asked if I had anywhere else to stay. I said no. They told me to go upstairs and lock myself there and gave me their number in case she did it again. I called my dad. All he said was \"did it work? Can we try that next time she is upset?\" Never asked if I was okay. I spent that weekend in fear. Just glares, snotty whispers, etc. Whenever I received less than an A, my mom would ignore me. After two days, she would start screaming. That would be a sigh of relief because it meant she would love me again by the end of the week. If she didn't, I was more worried. There were weekly arguments in my house between my parents. They would tell me to go upstairs and ignore them but I would foolishly ask them to stop. They did not care. They only cared about screaming at each other. My dad hates my mom but still cares about her. She had an abusive childhood and the alternative to her staying in our lives would be to be in a mental institution with stigma because she would be a divorced woman according to Indian society even though we live in America. My brother's autism means he can't say I love you. He wouldn't even know if I died. He has so many violent tantrums. He just hits himself repeatedly. He screams like a toddler except he's much much older. There have been so many nights in my life where I didn't sleep. All my grandparents passed away by the time I was 18 and a family friend. Those losses hit me hard. I've had anxiety for most of my life. I rarely socialized with people because my parents did not have time with me because of my brother. I was a freak. I got depression in 10th grade. My perfect record as a student was gone after that and I lost all motivation. My family in India thinks of my family as a black sheep so they all dislike me because I suffer from mental illness along with our family. They judge us but they haven't had to deal with mental illness. I mean who are they to judge. We went to India to see them, me and my father, and my uncle drunkenly said no one wanted you guys here but I convinced them to let you come. I've never felt so embarrassed in my life. We still had another week we were with them. My friend got raped when she was in college. I think she might hate me secretly. She had a girl she knew come over and they both got drunk. The other girl started puking and my friend started panicking. I told her to call two people she knew there. They didn't pick up and she said she was going to ask her neighbor across the hall for help. I didn't think twice and I said sure if you know him and you think he will help. She started calling me the next morning but I was tired of talking to her while she was drunk. She told me the next morning that she was raped by him. I've felt like scum ever since. Because I should have told her not to go. And my father had open heart surgery my senior year of high school. Just when I thought things would be going okay, I had to become an adult. I was depressed. Isolated. Barely any family came to help and I was seventeen. My uncle in the US came once a week to check in but no one was at the house full time. My mom was convinced my dad was faking and refused to help me or take responsibility. I started grocery shopping, driving my autistic brother to doctor's appointments, visiting my father at the hospital or wherever he was, I went to my part time job, and I started missing school. I would go in the morning, leave, and come back at the end of the day so it wouldn't count as an absence but an early dismissal. The attendance ladies knew me by name. My schoolwork started piling up. I couldn't see my friends because I had to be on call for my father or stay at the house for my mentally ill mother and brother. My dad had angry outbursts in public all the time but I was the one cleaning up the mess after him, convincing them he was harmless instead of a psycho. We also argue a lot. He tries to control me. He acts like he doesn't but he is slightly misyogynist. And he is unbelievably full of himself and at times displays little sympathy. He got so annoyed at me once while he was driving he hit me in the mouth while I had braces. It started bleeding so I screamed at him to take me to an ER because I was scared. He started arguing with me another day and I accidentally hit him between his eyes with a phone because I was trying to defend myself. I felt guilty hurting him and felt awful. I was just scared. I think I became sort of a monster. I started screaming and getting upset all the time. I would threaten violence or get very physical because I felt it was the only way to survive. On the day of my graduation, my dad and mom started screaming so I left for graduation in tears. My dad went because my friend's dad offered to drive him. He left halfway through and I waited half an hour afterwards to see if he would show up to congragulate me. He ended up going to dinner with the other dad and asked if I wanted to join him. All those empty promises from multiple family members saying earlier in my life that they would come stung. I ended up going to a school I wasn't going to go to because my dad thought it was more prestigious and it was closeish to home that I would be able to check up on the family. I hate it here. And I was so depressed and going home my first year, I failed to make friends. I am so lonely. And my dad said I could leave but then lied and said he didn't mean it so here I am in year 2. Still barely talk to anyone. My life should have been getting better, not getting worse. Now I can barely take showers. I don't have any motivation. I wasted two years of my life. My aunt and uncle live near me but they only talk when they need something. I have a car on campus. So they ask if I am going home one weekend to pick up some things. Or if could drive them to Walmart. Or if I can help them move. They left so late from their old apartment they slept in my dorm room so they wouldn't sleep in the lobby because I offered. But I know what they think of me. Because they never call otherwise. They claim it's because they do not want to disturb me but they know I don't have any friends. They told the people they were staying with that I wasn't their niece but I was a student driving them. I waited for an hr in the car eating fast food while they were packing up because I was only a student. I never even meet the people they are staying with. I sleep in a pile of trash everyday on my bed. Sometimes I don't sleep. Sometimes I sleep the whole day. Sometimes I miss all my classes. I wanted a sense of normalcy and instead I got this. I told 3 of my friends that I felt hopeless. But none of them take me seriously. I had one therapist tell me that I probably will not commit suicide so why bother talking about it. I told another at college but she said I am resistant to change and in that moment she was my last hope. I almost bought charcoal to kill myself but instead I cried the whole day and missed my classes instead. I am tired of keeping up this fake happy facade. I was only doing it for my brother. But it's getting too much now. I am doing all of the things you are supposed to do but it never seems like enough. ","366":"I'm 22 years old guy from India, and my life has been a constant stress. Ever since my childhood, I've been blamed for something or the other. As a child, most of you must have lived a decent life, but mine was completely Outta fear for my parents who would hit me, trash me and would abuse me. Though they said loved me, they always kept hitting me, I remember once or a few times being hit with a steel rod on my head a few times for leaving home and playing. I wanted to pursue cricket, they put me in arts and dance, they wanted to make me a singer, and TBH I have a horrible voice. I was good at cricket my teachers encouraged me yet my parents didn't bat an eye cause in India, it's all about engineers and doctors. I've had a hard time having actual friends due to the nature of my dad's work. And he would always take out his frustration out on me, like I was a toy. I've been bruised enough physically and mentally. And then I feel in love with a girl for the first time, she loved me for who I was, this was when my situation was on the worser side of things, she was there when I was troubled and to make things worse, my parents took the liberty of breaking my relationship and ever since I've lost my will to live on. It isn't about love, it is rather about my parents destroying everything I hold dear to me. I took to gaming to move away from reality and they broke my laptop. And then hours of struggle and my university recommended to get me a new one for my project. But now I've even lost the interest to face away from reality and find happiness. Also, the people I've had interaction on the university is either them asking for favours or you remain anonymous. I'm done living, I'm not able to find happiness. I just don't know, but I've a strong feeling to die. Maybe, I wasn't a good son, or they weren't good parents, I'm the victim now and I don't have my will to live.

And that's a good thing, because I can't count the number of times I've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go \"Just wait a little bit longer. You'll be happy someday\". I would like to kill myself, because yes, I'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. I try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. Let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. Before I ask you guys what I want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. There's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.I've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. It's been rough, and what sucks is just the country I live in, which I'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. It's India. Everyone here is a giant piece of shit. Everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. Doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. What makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation I get from coworkers from my full time job (I don't have friends to depend on). It's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. I don't think I can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimesThe worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time I'm suicidal). When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry if I sound angry, or like a shit person or something.","370":"When i was in freshman year of high school, one of my classmates committed suicide. i didn't know her, and we didn't talk, although the day before she died, she sat RIGHT next to me. she tried to make conservation, like tv ,movies, and video games, but i really didn't care and kind of ignored her. I regret not talking to her, it still haunts me. since the school was big, there was no memorial, and only her closest friends gave a shit. Even though I didn't know her, it killed me seeing her friends and parents so broken. i knew that I killed her, I could've talked to her, comforted her, even saved her life. After, I looked online and volunteered at a call center. It was horrible. We got almost no training, numerous prank calls, and the first person that I really talked to killed herself. Her name was Mary. She was raped and felt so ugly and broken. i gave it my all, but in the end she died. It really messed me up, I still think about it. but where i failed one, I \"saved\" a dozen more. I started on Reddit about less than a week ago and has been a roller coaster of a ride. I've met many different friends from all over the world from India to  Phoenix, AZ. They vary from race,age,religion, and class; but all share something together. see, what I've found is that most callers are not actually suicidal, their lonely, and lonely people have lonely thoughts. To those that were really suicidal, or in the process of killing themselves, I've learned that you can't really do anything except give them a friend in their final moments. And I have. this job is draining, but i love it. i love helping people. There are people and babies walking around today because of me, and they don't even know my name. that's the best part of it. The guy that talked to you in your darkest moment probably passed by you in the street today. Last night i spoke to my final call. She's a manic bipolar with a rough history. I didn't mean to contact her, but while tying up loose ends with the account I accidentally messaged her and she invited me into a chat. We talked for hours, about tv,movies,and video games. it was fun. It turned south though when she started talking about fucked her life was and about how she wanted to kill herself and was going to. after a while she stopped messaging me. I couldn't sleep. I sat by the computer all night long messaging her and shaking. time went by so slow, then a message popped up. I'll copy it from the text=   11:05 PM I\u2019m going to the hospital. Hopefully they will help me. Thank you for talking to me today, you kept me here. I hope you\u2019re doing okay too.= I'm happy. I cried tears of joy. I'm taking a break from this from for a while. but I'll be back. Just remember that the person that you talk to is real, and not just some robot.

Never really taught discipline from my hoarder mom who talked on the phone all day and didn\u2019t give me any attention last basic needs really.I have a couple of memories but they\u2019re at least a decade old at this point... a decade of neglect. Mom got married at 20 or some shit to my piece of shit fatass father who was 30 and not married(unheard of, dad was such an ugly fat shit) mom came from poor as shit background so her parents married against her will(arranged marriage) since dad made more than grandpaDad doesn\u2019t hesitate to bring this up constantly and says disgusting shit about her now dead dad since he had so many kids(5) shit like he fucked whores in the village.

Dad currently is slowly dying of kidney disease(not fast enough) fucking gave it to me and my sister. Honestly had a couple opportunities to kill him and make it seem like an accident but pussied out. Regret it now though. About me... piece of shit that just played computer games all day. Only graduated high school(1.9 gpa summer school every semester+ online classes, failed roughly half my classes every year) cuz teacher took pity on me but didn\u2019t care enough to get me real help. Rest just didn\u2019t like me. Couple of them really hated me. Slept in some classes since I couldn\u2019t sleep at home due to parents fighting and me crying\/anxious all night. Probably passed so the numbers looked good on their record. Better to have a 100% pass record one way or the other.Have failed in classes since 2nd grade when I moved to the US. Not dumb just lazy and unmotivated. By junior high hated school due to bullying. Video games and books the only escape. No one wanted to be friends with me till 9th grade.  I did have some friends but lost them since I was too needy. Got no attention at home so overcompensated and weirded them out. I would say there are like 3 people i have  considered true friends. No contact with them now.9th prolly start of my depression. Started community college. Did my work for a bit and then didn\u2019t show up to any finals failed out 1st sem. Academic probation prevented me from easily signing up again so ended up not signing up at all. Didn\u2019t tell my parents. After probation lifted didn\u2019t sign up again and didn\u2019t tell my parents. They found out eventually.Leads to me being sent to India to work IT since my dad knows a religious ceo of a company. Jobs not bad people are fine.Living with aunt\/uncle they were super nice and understanding, encouraged me to open up. Told them my life. They relayed it back to my dad and mom who both vehemently refused and lied. Auntand uncle know about my parents shit relationship and fighting constantly and have known since start of marriage. Uncle actually originally set up marriage.Religious reasons divorce not possible for them apparently.My parents told them that I shouldn\u2019t be able to access internet and have to have a ton of extra activities and do part time college. On top of 70 hour work week from monday-Saturday which I was actually doing fairly well. Just was lazy on 3 sundays(3 weeks). Now suddenly got the news that I have to move out in 4 days on my own. Had a panic attack, they called me a crazy retard and made fun of me during it. I yelled and broke my glasses. They just ignored me. They don\u2019t fucking care. I showed up late to work 2-3 times. Boss just says keep your personal shit out. \u201cWhy are you so lazy?\u201dDad probably talked to boss.I should\u2019ve fucking known.. my life is shit. It makes sense. They gave me hope and fucking crushed it. It\u2019s pretty easy to kill yourself in India. The traffic is insane most people just bank on pedestrian survival instinct to not hit pedestrians but I want to die.  I don\u2019t really care if it\u2019s painful. It\u2019ll be nothing compared the last 10+ years of pain I\u2019ve enduredUpdate: turns out the fight with my aunt and uncle was mostly in my head... talked to them the following morning and they don\u2019t hate me or anything...My brain is messed up and twisted the situation ","372":"Everything sucks. I feel so empty and sad I feel like I was born just to be a disappointment. I don\u2019t get the point in hurting for so long that you go completely numb then maybe getting a few moments of happiness then it all goes away again. How am I supposed to be happy when everything that used to make me happy doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ve tried instruments, I\u2019ve tried painting and drawing, I\u2019ve tried all sorts of hobbies but nothing makes me feel happy. I sick of searching for happiness I\u2019m just done. I envy people who are happy, sometimes when I see someone I know having a good time or something i purposely say something mean to try to bring them down. I hate I\u2019ve become like this I\u2019m bitter and sad and I\u2019ve lost so many friends but it\u2019s all my fault so I have no reason to complain about it. Life is just terrible, or life is just terrible to me. I\u2019m filling up the bath tub right now and I\u2019m ready to just end it fucking all. I\u2019m sorry India if you ever read this, which I doubt but just Incase, I love you and please don\u2019t do anything to yourself when I\u2019m gone I love you so much I know you deserve to be happy I just wasn\u2019t made to be.","373":"Hey Guys,I don\u2019t want to get into details of why I am in this situation, I just want to get it over with. I just completed my 3rd attempt on life, thinking 3rd time would be the charm. Though I planned it so carefully, I fucked it up really big time. I planned to hang myself after a drink and a shot of morphine, to make the hanging less painful. The only thing I remember is taking a 5 shots of vodka and injecting with morphine, after that I woke up tied to the hospital bed. I was in the psychiatric ward for 2 days, the way doctor talked to me, gave me more motivation to finish what I started and now I am hell bent on doing that. Got a new perspective on how to finish the job. If you cant do it yourself seek help and do it. I am from India, the southern part to be specific. I just registered for organ donation and got my organ donation card. So I want someone who can help me die, so that that person will be able to take me to the hospital in a brain dead condition, so that I can donate my organs. Just think about it, isn\u2019t better that around 6 people can benefit, rather than me living a worthless life.One way or the other, I will kill myself, but its up to someone, to help other suffering by making my death meaningful or I die in vain, the choice is up to guys and of course I can make you worthwhile for your troubles\/help.

Despite having a decent gpa, internship experience and even being part of the robotics team at my school I just can't seem to land something. I apply to 5-15 places a day and actively go to meetups and ask people for leads but no one in my family or people I grew up with works in the correct industries. I hear professors say your degree depreciates very quickly and by 6 months it is almost worthless. I dont have the time or money to attempt to break into another field like accounting or computer science. No one hires in December and I'm waiting on one decisiom as every other place has either rejected me because other candidates have more experience or ghosted me. Even technician positions don't want me. I worked so hard to avoid this shit. I could've gone to parties, hooked up with tons of girls, and attended a party school but I didn't. I put myself around engineers going to engineering clubs, being a part of hands of design groups and even went to a reputable school. There were no girls as in most circles guys outnumbered girls 10 to 1. All of that for nothing. All because corporations just want cheap labor so they lied saying they needed more engineers. What they really wanted was more **cheap** engineers from India or Pakistan. ","375":"I am from student from india.  I have done my engineering 4 years ago. 3 years ago i was put into Mba program by giving me false hopes of happiness in my mind and heart by my own parents. Since i am not mentally capable of grasping any subjects in Mba for over 2 years,  i have repeatedly failed in almost every subject for over 4 semester,  i am currently writing and reappearing for the 4th year for a 2 year mba program,  i am very hopeless to give a small job interviews in this new city called Bangalore,  where every kid from india is shoved into saying it will brighten their future,  all i am seeing is a dark and empty mind,  i dont know whether to continue any further of my life in a rotten motel for the past 3 years.  Please help or give me advice on what to do next,  i am so hopeless and i am thinking of doing drugs and killing myself.","376":"I am a single 35 yr old woman. I lost my father last year. Mom is in a sorry state very fragile. As a child i was not the preferred one and was sidelined for my sibling brother. I was led on by my bf for 8 years and now I have run out of options to settle down. Since I come from India I stay with my family. I am not treated well. I am also facing issues in my office. I don't have friends. It feels like not a single soul on earth really cares for me. I dream of running away and ending my life every second. I just needed a friend but no one cared. I only see one way out of this misery. And that will benefit everyone. I won't be missed for sure. ","377":"Suicidal thoughts have been entering my mind for a long time. Previously they were weak. Now they're getting a bit intense.I find living pointless. My parents have invested a lot in me. My sister is soft-hearted. I'll break my parents' mind and my sister's too. They'll kill themselves if I die.My mom seems a bit psychotic at times. The death of her mom seems to have affected her mental health. It's been 1 year + since that event. My parents have a broken marriage. A sexless life. They live away from each other. They aren't filing for divorce just because they want to protect my sister and me.I would appreciate a life partner. I doubt it's gonna happen but whatever. I'm not that interested. I'm pessimistic about that. Marriages and having children seem pointless for me. My dad had a bad father. I had a bad father. Don't want to pass that on. I want to help other people. My idea of \"random acts of helping people, especially those who need help\".I can't tell anyone all of this. Tell my friends? Way no. Idk why but not them. My family? Mom? She attempted suicide a year ago and I stopped her. Dad? He's crazy. My sister? She'll worry too much about me.I care too much about those who surround me. But I care too much that I don't want anyone to waste their time worrying about me. This is morally correct.Life sucks. If I had a gun, I'd shoot myself right now. My luck is bad that I'd survive a shot to the head and be left paralyzed for the rest of my life.Life sucks. I'm well known for never lying. But I've lied a lot to myself that stuff will get better. I think I should call a suicide helpline. I don't know if I'll be reported to the police or something. I'm in India.","378":"Background: Parents are about to get evicted because Dad runs a start-up and has no salary\/savings + thousands in debt. He's been broke for years trying to run a business, but continues to do so. Mom works part time retail, doesn't have skills\/education to get a full-time job. Her money is only good for groceries, utilities, etc. I'm in college and I have only enough resources to support myself. I suffer from serious anxiety and depression and am dying inside because it's making me sick to watch this happening to my parents. We live in California so everything is horribly expensive (app. $3000 for rent) and my parents won't be able to find another apartment because no credit history,income, or savings and my mom's employment is only available at our current place. I don't have a good relationship with Dad, but I love Mom and watching her go through this is incredibly tough. I'm the only reliable family Mom has left (her family back in India is also very poor and struggling), so I know I have to live for her, but I want everything to go away so badly.

I'm not even sure how much they understand what it means to be gay, certainly not from a western view point. They are of course not taking this well, they were\/are still trying to marry him off...  He is first generation Indian.  He isn't talking to his best friend, or anyone else for that matter.  I'm in Afghanistan, I'm deployed.  I made him promise me that he would call his best friend.  I got his permission to call our neighbor to check in on him.  I got him to promise me not to hurt himself, but he is thinking it so who knows what that promise it's worth.   I'm looking for suggestions and advice.  Anything helps.  I don't want to betray his trust and tell all my friends what's happening, but at the same time I need to ensure he makes it through this.  I'd rather have him hate me alive than be dead.  Please help me.","380":"Hello and good day. Now, let's cut to the chase.I am 17 years old, male, living in india and in the final year of my school (12th). I first went to my school counsellor in the beginning of 2015. Then after 4 visits over the year she told me i should see a psychologist\/chiatrist. I was depressed. Still am. I didn't have the gall to tell it to my parents directly because i knew they'd not understand, get angry, give very general advice (which i hate) and make it difficult for me to make a visit. So i took the counsellor's help to break the news, first to my mum and then eventually to my dad and elder brother. * she was upset, still thinks that she failed in upbringing me and they all obviously gave general advice* i eventually went to a psychologist and a chiatrist, stopped going to the chologist after 8 months, still go to the chiatrist* the only one i share with the most is my brother, he is far, far more understanding than my parents and while his advice is less general and more personal in nature (which is better) he still lacks the understanding of the disorder which i look for (he is 9 years older than me and lives in Canada for 4+ years now)* i too wish to move abroad, always have, even dreamt about when i was just 12\/13 years old, way before my brother even thought of moving. I absolutely fucking hate it here. * Not wanting to boast or come of as special (i am just like you), i am much, much more different than the people around me. In my tastes, preferences, mode of expression, language, more articulate, thoughts, understanding, beliefs and interests. Very few i have come across that are similar. * since i was a kid i was (i now realise and think) raised on the input of others' belief that i was special, gifted and intelligent. Now I think that it fucked me up for later in life. I was sent to a tuition when i was just 5. Just 5! I now detest this fact. However, i was naive and followed. As you may guess, my childhood didn't consist of play outside. But rather studying and play inside. Sheltered. * it was easy to maintain and live up to their illusion of being gifted till 8\/9th grade. Just 1.5 hrs of study at the tuition and i was free for the rest of the day. Then i started realising that I wanted more of life and less of studying. That's obviously not what my parents want. * their prime concern is my education (read:schooling), i hate schooling. As said above, my ideas on education are also starkly different, as are my friends'. They (my mum) have went as far as saying (implying) that as long as i study it doesn't matter what else i do. * due to recent events i am writing even this under the guise of studying. Bad as it may sound, luckily less educated parents are easier to fool.Now, on to the recent events. My class 10th result was saved because of my school's interference (as always) with the students' results. My class 11th result was therefore obviously a disaster. Class 12th you may now imagine how it could be going.For the last 10+ days (of vacation) i have done nothing but indulged in escape (which has skyrocketed). I watch movies, play video games and sleep (luckily i am able to carry out other basic tasks as well, unlike other, more suffering people). This upset my mother once more and then this Friday, this is what went down:Night. Watching anime. Haven't studied the entire day. Mum enters the room, angry, upset. **violent**. Asks me to shut down the computer. I comply. Goes on a anger spree of shouting at me, questioning me on my behaviour. I don't answer. I don't want to. I don't trust them. I absolutely detest them. **i maintain silence**. She starts getting violent. Hits me. Hard. On the face, almost near the eyes. Luckily had took off glasses. I don't cry (i haven't for the last 4 years), i feel unable to, at best i can laugh (i didn't do that in front of her). So, she hits me. No scars, no bruises, no marks. Just a slightly swollen face. I still maintain silence for the most part. Not giving in. She then proceeds to leave, go out and cry in front of her god. I didn't go out till she started wailing. Then as any sensible human would do, i went out with tissues and a glass of water. She didn't accept. I made an apology i didn't feel and that's when dad arrived from work. She wouldn't even let me offer him water! Said i don't need to do any more work. That i should just look after myself, all my needs will be taken care of and that i had always been my own master. **i still didn't care**. Then dad wanted me to come sit with him. I told him to have dinner and then I'd come out. I did, explained to him in the most barebone terms what had happened and went to bed after about an hour. ------------------------------------------------I think to myself, what if i was disowned. What'd i do? How'd i act and prepare for it? I make a mental plan and imagination. Would i like it? I try to make it as realistic as possible.Meanwhile i am thinking of suicide. Like last night and today morning. Then Saturday morning i wake up, bathe and get a new med with the help of my chiatrist. Mood improves and falls back by night.I half-assedly study. Mum gives me more of advice that i hate. She says that i can tell her if i don't like it. I don't, but i refrain from saying anything because... well, she'll just get angry.------------------------------------------------Now i am here. With a plan in my mind to give my tuition tests, come back home, gulp a couple of aspirins, take a warm water bath (in my clothes), and make vertical cuts down my arms and a horizontal slit across my neck and **end my life**. This subreddit is an attempt to get by another day. Thank you for your help. I love you all and hope that you can overcome your demons.If I survive, I'll at least be able to play some new video games, live another day and live to see my chiatrist. Ha, haha, hahahahahaha.........","381":"I am feeling very down. I just feel very lonely right now, and would like to chat with someone. I am from India if it matters. I can chat over skype, telegram or any other app.I am not in immediate danger of suicide. However, while lying in bed today, and many times, I was thinking that how it would be to end my life. So I could say I am thinking of suicide, but not seriously as an option at all. ","382":"My girlfriend of two and a half years cheated on me in early March. Through all the emotional turmoil, in the good moments, despite the age difference, she was the most beautiful and colorful person I had met since my mother (who passed away when I was 12). I miss her and I hate her. And I know that this \"love\" thing is some projection, some neuronal activity. But consciousness, however subjective, is still consciousness.These past few weeks have broken mental boundaries that in hindsight I became accustomed to while with her, especially as we lived together, and the idea of suicide seems to makes perfect sense. It's not out of desperation or sadness - depression mainly - but the rationale seems to be as clear as a blue sky.Out of all of the anger and betrayal, I feel I can understood where she had come from - or at least convince myself in whatever self-rationalization melody that comes to my mind. Is she worse than me? Maybe? Maybe not? In my late teens and early 20's (probably until about 23-24; I am 28 now), I'd be guilty, mainly as a result of alcohol, of trying to sleep with girls that had boyfriends or friends of an ex. Largely to fuel a fairly insecure ego, there was a unique taboo thrill that was otherwise non-existent. The girls were either non-complying or they would paint their partners in such a way that it would attenuate the guilt for both of us. My attempts usually failed, but moral deontology seems most fitting. Around 25, I had a couple of mushroom and LSD experiences, and realised how toxic and maladaptive and painful this was for both myself and others. I tried my best to forgive myself and apologise to anyone whom I have hurt.This cheating has triggered a lot of that. In a way, I can understand where the guy has come from. In another way, though I don't believe in karma, it does seem like some cosmic punishment. I have never cheated, but if under the right circumstances, and in the age bracket of 19-23, would I have done just as she had did?But this experience has allowed me to 'unlock' a certain emotion and pain that I had only heard about from friends or see in movies. The pain that I may have caused other people is palpable. I tried my best to be a good person to my girlfriend - I made mistakes, and said regretful things in anger, but most of the time I forgave a lot of her emotional breakdowns and verbal abuse, and in our good moments I tried to be loving, compassionate, and caring. When we both had good days, I marvelled at the depth of her self-awareness and humor. But now I wonder if it was just her ability to easily adapt to others (more than me). I never had a compulsion to cheat - there were temptations about other girls, and fantasies, sure, but the idea of being with someone else was completely alien.\"Love\" seemed like such a powerful force beyond anything hedonistic. I guess that's why I find it difficult to fathom her direct rationale (though I can still understand that it's more complex than just good people and bad people), but can understand where the guy - whom I hate - comes from.But maybe there are bad people and I am too understanding? Personality disorders, and sociopathy, are certainly true. Just disordered people? I think I am too understanding to people's actions and abuse as a way to admit the truth about people. I did this with my alcoholic mother, and I think it's a fairly entrenched coping mechanism to pretend I am 'psychoanalysing' people when deep down I can't assimilate that there are bad people without a modicum of good.But I have always appreciated Carl Jung's concept of the \"shadow\". I think all of us, given the right circumstances and environment, are capable of causing severe pain to others -- rooted in delusion, manipulation, or hedonism. The resolution is to become aware of this side of this rather than suppress it. So, I guess I see \"bad people\" as not accepting their shadow but being overwhelmed by it. This all seems to conflict with modern day psychology, and getting fairly pseudo, but I cannot help but espouse a deep affinity to Jung's work.It seems that I either want to help and be kind to others, or indulge hedonistically in selfish acts that will cause pain to others. There's no in between. It's almost schizophrenic. How can I help people as a psychologist myself, or in writing or music, if I will carry around a \"shadow\" for the rest of my existence?Will I succumb to desires and try and sleep with girls again that have partners? A part of me desperately wants to. And knowing the pain I experience now, to be the guy that causes that to others would be too much to bare.So if I can't help people, because I can hurt people, I don't see a reason to live. If I'm not in love, and invested, I can easily see myself using alcohol again and hurting people. My only issue is that I'll hurt my father and some close family and friends in my death. I have a lot of people that \"know\" me, and appreciate the concept with me, but I'm close with a rare few. To the majority, I will become shock value to the people that know of me, and talk will circulate for a week or two, and suicide awareness statuses on Facebook will come up (\"YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PEOPLE\"), and people will pretend to 'mourn' me since that would be the train to jump on, but not many people will miss me since not many people know me. But, no matter how many words I write, nobody will understand directly my experience - nor will I understand yours.For the people that do know me, I was considering recording a piano album and then travelling overseas to South East Asia and maybe India. There overseas I plan to write and bleed my journey (sorry these words are shitty; I can't think very clear lately) and conclude it with a suicide letter. I'd try my best to explain to the people that do love me that it had to be done, and that suicide, if given clear thought, shouldn't be completely frowned upon. There's a difference between suicide out of mental illness and suicide based on lengthy deliberation. Why am I not allowed to check out of this dream of life? It's all a brief dream before we return to the void. If I can't help people because I've hurt people, and I've recorded my music and written a story, then what else is there to do? Grow old and enter a job I hate?This idea may go out the window tomorrow, since my suicidal ideation is coming in waves, and I am seeing a psychologist, but I honestly can't think of why I shouldn't suicide if: a) I explain to the people I love why I had to do it; b) I complete certain creative outlets. There's nothing else to do. I've fallen in love. I've been betrayed. I've hurt people. I've helped people. I'll travel a bit. What else is there? Grow old? Nothing is nearly as special after the first time, is it? There's nothing I can do besides working in the helping profession. And even if it's not about hurting people, how can I help people if I struggle with mental health myself? Maybe this suicide rationale is not so \"clear\" but stems from a bleak depression and I'm not admitting it to myself? So, if I am killing myself for the story, likely in some disassociated state, I haven't worked out where or how? If I do something transparently poetic, I'll be seen as something more than I am or considered more crazy. I don't know what I am writing.In all my previous depressions, I never thought of suicide as the answer. But it finally makes sense. It's so simple. I'm rambling on. Thanks for reading.","383":"So Im 17,from India.

Let's hope I achieve them.","389":"So, if you go through my post history you'll see I posted about a year ago. This is going to be another long post full of self-pity and self-loathing. I'm not the most talented writer, but feel free to laugh with me or at me.I'm 34 now, I can't believe I've made it this long. I REALLY hate life. I do not recall ever requesting to be born, if I did I surely wasn't old enough to make that decision when I did. I know no one ever gets to \"choose\" whether or not they're born and that's just the very first example of life being inherently unfair. You neither get to choose to be born, and society damn sure doesn't want you to choose when you die.Before I digress too much let me get back on track. You now know my age, that I hate my life, and probably have put together the fact that I want to die. It won't be this week or next, but soon a promise I made will have been kept, I will not agree(even if it's on her deathbed) to further extend my life. When I was younger my mother discovered a close family friend who had committed suicide by shotgun, I don't know whether it was the gruesome scene that stuck with her or the fact that the family friend had made the decision to end his life unilaterally and didn't allow anyone to act to prevent him from doing so that stuck with her, but I promised as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive that I would not go through with any plans. Fortunately(for me) my mother is nearing the end of her life. A few years ago she was diagnosed with Acromegaly, basically a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and causes excessive amounts of HGH to enter the blood stream. It doesn't cause too much damage on its own, but it caused enough problems that she had to have it biopsied. She was also diagnosed with Lupus. She's a strong woman, no it's not an oedipus complex or anything. She was a single mom who raised my brother and I virtually alone. My father was around but was never much of a father. He cheated on her, they divorced. She went back to school and became a nurse and despite growing up in(and continuing to exist in) poverty I know that I was loved. Because of her, I've avoided most of the major pitfalls in life-drugs, tobacco, gambling, alcohol addiction. I've got a borderline addiction with computer gaming, but I frequently go weeks without touching the computer just to prove to myself that I can.Anyway I was not the best student. I was too smart for my own good. I always HATED teachers who used to assign tons of homework and say \"If you don't do my homework, you won't pass my tests.\" Don't get me wrong, I get why homework is given-I always have, it's just I always took that statement as a challenge and I accepted it if the subject was not one of particular interest to me. Long story short, I wouldn't do the homework, WOULD pass their tests, ace their finals\/midterms and end up passing with a low-mid 70's grade. Towards the end of High School I finally grew up a bit and realized that my stubbornness was only hurting myself, and would not cause the teachers to be honest. I did better in my junior year, and made high honor roll for my entire junior year and the first half of my senior year. Sadly, the damage had already been done and my transcript made me look like an idiot. Thankfully, I had never really envisioned college in my long term plans. Back in the 7th or 8th grade there was this test called the Occupational Outlook Handbook which was supposed to help you figure out what you wanted to do with your life. I never enjoyed computer programming. I had a buddy that was in to that, the closest I ever got to coding was back when I had an old Tandy and had that spiral bound notebook where you had to manually enter the code for the games BEFORE you could play them. I wish I took more enjoyment from coding, but I've always enjoyed building and troubleshooting them. I remember saving up and ordering an AMD K6 166mhz processor, buying the parts and building my first system. First teaching myself what goes where and how everything connected. Then firing it up and learning post errors and FINALLY getting it to start up, learning how to format a HDD and install DOS, Windows, an old game Fokker, eventually I got a hold of a game called Descent. Anyway, long story short I LOVED that stuff. So when I took this test and it told me about the wonderful opportunities for PC Repair Technicians and the impressive salary(45-60,000 a year) that technicians were supposed to make I was sold. Getting paid to do what you love, that's every mans dream, right?So, I planned High School out to situate myself to get into the workforce as a technician. My city had this program called BOCES which prepared students for a career right out of high school. They had a ton of different programs from Electricians, Electronics repair, automotive repair, CIS programs, nursing programs, they had a TON of programs. Naturally I saw the CIS program and jumped at the opportunity. My Junior year I began taking CIS I, which sadly was basically a joke. It was a course teaching people how to use Microsoft Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint, some Access). It seemed more like a course designed to train secretaries and \"Executive Assistants\" but whatever I was learning something about computers. I was not exactly thrilled, especially when my brother went through the program a year before me and was learning about AS400 systems and windows servers. I was told when I finally asked about this towards the end of the year that \"some of that\" would be covered in year 2 of the program. I was pissed, but then something happened I never expected. My senior year was coming ahead and the school announced that next year they'd be piloting a one-year program called \"A+ Computer Repair\". I was like a kid in a candy store when I found out. I signed up and was(no exaggeration) the best student in the class. I graduated with a perfect score, I'd sometimes skip regular school and stay there to do a double class some days just to learn more. I would be sent to other classes that were having computer problems to fix their shit-I once saved a paper a Finish program(single mothers finishing high school) student had on a floppy disk that was corrupted(her 3.5\" disk was failing). I opened the file in edit and copied\/pasted all that I could into a new file on the HDD. The girl was hot as hell and was so grateful she didn't know how she could ever thank me enough. I felt like a hero and a pig for having a response in my mind that I'd never dare speak. On that day I felt like I was made to do that kind of work.So I graduated High School on schedule in the year 2001 with a somewhat crappy GPA(except this program where I had 4 quarters of 100+'s). I took my certification exam, got certified and I went out to search for those lucrative \"PC Repair Technician\" jobs I was told were coming and were going to be in such high demand.Ok, so not very many available in\/around Buffalo, NY. I did what I had to do to get some experience and earn some cash. I took a job at one of the first \"Outsourcing Technical Support\" companies, a crappy company called ClientLogic. They handled support for a bunch of different companies from Sony to Iomega to Netzero. I was hired on at Sony. I put in the time there, hating it. I was making 8.25 an hour and it wasn't about solving problems, it was about getting people off the phone in under 8 minutes. Call after call of being yelled at, being told how shitty Sony products were. I wasn't just supporting sony PC's, I was supporting their WebTV products, their TV's, DVD players, DSS receivers, and yes their VAIO PC's and laptops. I grew to hate my job, but I was earning experience. Until...One day I showed up for work and was told they were relocating their operations and closing down their call center. It turns out they were moving to India or the Bahamas, I don't remember- I just remember that was my first encounter with \"outsourcing\" and \"globalization.\"So I moved on and found another(better) job working for an ISP called Adelphia. Long story short I was hired during the beginning of their bankruptcy process. I was told I'd have job security and would be doing technical support with an opportunity to advance through the company.I did the job and got great performance reviews and helped a lot of customers. Every so often I'd get some crappy supervisor who'd tell me \"It's not your responsibility to fix that, you need to transfer those calls to tier 2\". I was only in tier 1, we were classified as \"reboot monkeys\" by the tier 2's\/3's. I refused to wear that label so I fixed everything I could. I'd argue with my supervisors, who'd wonder how I managed to keep my AHT so low(so I could earn my bonus) and go so far beyond. Well, I'm not saying I was a great employee, my phone had a lot of problems with calls randomly \"dropping\". One 15 minute call and 1 2 second call creates an AHT of 7:30. I justified it to myself by reminding myself that when I was hired I was told that my job would be to help customers resolve their internet connectivity problems. I was also told that I'd have the opportunity to advance.Long story short, after 3 years the company was sold off to Time Warner and Comcast and split. Our \"secure\" jobs now weren't. I walked out the day they rebranded us from Tier 1 Support to CCRHSIT1. CCR standing for Customer Care Representative. Along with the re-branding came a new QA policy, if I failed to offer to take a credit card payment at the beginning of EVERY call I'd get a Zero QA(which DQ'd me from my bonus for the month and would get me a disciplinary warning\/write up). I said to my supervisor \"Fuck this, I was hired as technical support not just customer service. I refuse to ask people for money when the service they're already paying for isn't working\". I walked out and about 15 others did as well. Later that day I got a call from that same supervisor offering me my job. The TAC shut down a year later. I was now unemployed and job hunting. I managed to get unemployment by arguing that the position they hired me for no longer existed and I lost my job due to the transition to Time Warner. So I was looking for a new job, and not finding any. There were no computer repair technician jobs to be found.In 2005 I came out to Las Vegas to see what it was all about and opened the \"help wanted\" section of the paper and saw...jobs.Needless to say after this I moved to Las Vegas, where I've lived since December of 2006. I quickly found a job after moving with a Tradeshow Technology Rental company. There wasn't a ton of \"PC Repair\" work, but there was a lot of customizing machines, imaging, on-site networking. I got to do some traveling on the companies dime. It was a cool gig. I was promoted to Weekend Operations Lead, a SMALL raise along with the added responsibility of overseeing local weekend operations. I was happy.And then the national economy tanked. The company only made 1.6 million in profit that year instead of the 1.9 million from the year before. The head of the company decided he wanted out of the industry and sold the company to a competitor. Just like that I was unemployed again. Only now the economy was in the shitter and there were no jobs to be had. I had to sell my place and move back in with my mother. Even though my place was next door to hers(yes, a trailer) I couldn't afford the lot-rent without a job, so I sold it off. Yeah, good luck trying to date when you're approaching 30, unemployed, and live with your mom. Finally, a friend from that past job got me an opportunity at a major casino doing IT Support for the Hotel and Casino(hint, their symbol is a giant Guitar). The pay was nowhere near the 45-60k a year I was promised but it was better than any job I'd had before($18\/hour). There were tons of new systems and technology to familiarize myself with. I had to learn so much, and I did. IDF locations, Virtual Servers and machines, network monitoring, active directory, the IBM i5 system, and so much more. About 9 months later in early December of 2012 I was called in on my day off along with 4 other employees.We were told that the new VP of Operations was hired earlier in the year and has decided that the IT department didn't need to be manned 24 hours a day. As such the budget would be slashed significantly. That means personnel cuts. That means we're out of our jobs. Don't worry about the chaos that happens when the night club can't process all of their credit card transactions at 3am because one of them is \"stuck\". Don't worry about the hell that happens when the print server crashes at 3am and NOBODY can print in the entire hotel\/casino. But that's ok, because the new VP gets to say that she cut 150+ grand in annual unnecessary costs in the IT department.No severance package for me(because I wasn't there for over a year), no unemployment either(I was only there about 9 months). And that's when I gave up.I realized then that there's no longer such a thing as employer-employee loyalty. Gone are the days where you can expect to hold a job for 30 years and then retire. How sad is that, my goal in life was to work for some place at a modest wage, be a good little wage slave and then retire. I couldn't even be granted that dignity. Nope.Our society's become a place where the only people that have any sense of job security are the people at the top or those who make themselves indispensable to a company. IT support is an industry where that's just not possible. Now you've got entire companies outsourcing their IT to MSO's. Who do everything in their power to drive down the wages. So I said fuck it, and I haven't had a job since. I refused to be a part of a system that would use me and discard me like a dixie cup. Secretly I wanted a comet to kill me and put me out of my misery.I refused to get a job. My mother had an injury and went on workers comp, I still refuse to get a job). She insisted everything be put in my name(so if\/when she gets sick and needs hospice they can't force her to sell it). This also means she can't throw me out, because everything on paper belongs to ME. I don't defend this, I know I'm being selfish and childish and risking homelessness. They've stopped her workers comp(her lawyer's fighting to get her comp for life, so the insurance company is playing hardball). She's worried about not being able to pay the rent and winding up homeless. That would suck, but I don't care. I refuse to be a part of that system. I told her long ago that I wouldn't end my life as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive. That's it.We're now living off of her Social Security Disability. A little over 1,100 a month. Rent, utilities, car payment, insurance. SNAP and Medicaid. If her comp doesn't get restored soon, I imagine the first thing to go will be my car and the insurance. Then we should be able to get by, barely. As for utilities, we have Cox, I have a phone, she has a safelink minute phone, and we qualified last year for LI-HEAP. If the worst case happens and we end up facing eviction she can move back to NY with her friend. I'll just use that 80-grain .40 cal S&amp;W that I've got stored in my safe. I've told her as much. I've been to counseling, but I refuse to even try anti-depressants. On the permit to carry concealed weapons there's a question \"Do you currently or have you ever taken Anti-Depressants\". Answering yes to that denies you from being issued a permit.Additionally, there's been a lot of push and talk about disarming people who are on anti-depressants. They also take away your firearms if you're ever taken in on a 5150 hold. My firearm is a part of my \"Exit strategy\" it's elaborate and it insures that the police will find me, not some random housekeeper. If I ever get taken in on a 5150 or lose my firearms another way I'll have to switch to plan B which involves turning a firing range into a bloody mess and traumatizing a bunch of people. Removing my firearm wouldn't stop me, I'm smart enough to know how to gain access to one legally. Anyway, I talked to a therapist back in 2014 and laid all this out to her and explained that I am suicidal, but not imminently so(so she isn't required to call 911)because of the promise I made to my mother. Her response \"If something ever happens to your mom, you should give me a call and we'll get you some help\". Are you fucking kidding me, does she think I'm an idiot? I'm telling her I want to die, but won't as long as she's alive and you think I'm going to call you when she dies so you can have me committed-so the police can take my weapons and the doctors can force-feed me pills and evaluate me until I can convince them I'm not a risk to myself. She insulted my intelligence, and I called her out on it and told her as much. She smiled...wtf?A few sessions later, she tells me I should \"go get a job to let my mind focus on other things\". As if it wasn't the never-ending pattern of getting a job\/losing said job to no fault of my own that put me in this headspace. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm out. I haven't went back since. So now here I am, my mom's health's deteriorating, every day I wake up knowing my mom's one day closer to passing away. I love her dearly and have honored and will continue to honor the promise I made. Having said that I will not be granting any deathbed pleas she may make. I know she wants me to go on living, but I don't want to live in this world. Even before Trump got elected president I didn't like where this country and the world in general were headed. I didn't like that I was constantly shamed for having my so called \"white privilege\" even though I grew up just as poor as possible.Even though I watched less-qualified applicants get jobs because of affirmative action. Only for those applicants to quit or get fired a week later and see the same job opening back up. I didn't like that globalization and automation were utterly decimating jobs, leading to staggering levels of unemployment(and the creation of a class of people like myself who have been unemployed for so long we're now excluded from the unemployment percentage). Those jobs that remained after automation and globalization are now so heavily in demand by applicants fresh out of school or recently unemployed that wages have become a race to the bottom. A culture has been created where we should \"just be grateful to have a job\" even though the jobs suck, the pay sucks, the benefits suck, you're constantly under threat of being terminated by terrible bosses. I hate that it seems like I want my mother to die. I don't, I love her dearly. I just refuse to be another cog in the machine called \"society\". I wish we lived in a world with an implemented UBI, so I could actually just focus on enjoying my life or doing something with my life and time instead of hating myself for being alive. I realize my behavior is that of a damn parasite. Let's talk \"romance and sex life\" for a moment, I've had 1 girlfriend in my entire life. She was my first everything, she also cheated on me and I was dumb enough to take her back about 6 different times over our 3 years together. Eventually she got pregnant by another guy, that's when we finally ended it for good. I've had sex in total with about 7 different woman in my life. 5 of which were prostitutes. I'm no Brad Pitt. I'm fat, have a hunchback(from having to walk home while lugging about 50 pounds of books every night during my freshman\/sophmore years of high school.) Oh about those prostitutes I mentioned, I once disgusted a prostitute to the point where she made a sound indicating she was repulsed when I sweat on her face during the missionary position. Not saying that was traumatizing, but for fuck sake. I realize that many of you may be judging me, some may be laughing at me, and others may have platitudes to offer to try and cheer me up, I appreciate you reading all of this, I realize it's been a giant wall of text with no TL;DR. Having said that, I don't think anything you have to say will help. You may think I need anti-depressants, and maybe according to some doctors I do. Then again maybe I'm just an example of a genetic mutation that should be removed from the gene pool of our species.

I was just wondering if anyone had any more details about this. Will this be covered by insurance (medicaid for ex)? If not how much will it cost? What is the process like? Both in terms of appeals\/paperwork etc... and the actual physical process. Would I be allowed to access to this service with clinical depression? Or is it only for some terminal illnesses and not all? I will look things up myself when I can. I am in india atm, and the WiFi I have here is abysmal. In the meantime, any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.","392":"I am a 18-year old High school student from Finland. I am pretty sure i have a mild asperger or that i am just a extreme innovert. I cant watch another human into eyes and i talk in monotone voice and never use my body as i speak (if i speak) I dont have any siblings and never really gotten along with people. My Mom and dad separated when i was something like 5. Growing up was hard for me, because i needed to take sides about everything. I lived 1 week with mom then 1 week with dad and so on. You can imagine what would happen if i did something for my dad and next week i was with mom. My mom is a full time alcoholic who only cares about himself. My dad was a total jerk before and hated that i spend time on pc when i had spare time, even if he would easily watch 8 hours of tv a day. I am average on school. i get 7s and 8s (same as B, B-, C), but my dad always tells me how bad i am and will never get a job. My dad was a coder before the company outsourced to India. Now he has calmed down, but is turning into alcoholic. He usualy drinks a bottle of whiskey or wine a day. I hate myself, because i think a lot of thinks and want to tell abaut them, but when i open my mouth nothing comes out. I just cant transform my thought to actual conversation. I only have a few friends, because i find most of my age naive brats. I have come to the point that i dont care abaut my appearance. I am skinny guy with usualy jean and a t shirt or hoodie. I dont care abaut sports so i am not muscular. I like food, but i am borderline underweight, because i spend my time on computer drinking energy drinks and not eating anything. After Highschool i want to study engineering.  Last year my dad turned full evil. I dont know what happened he was still employed,, but i couldn't be home anymore. As i was only child my dad allways on back and i didnt have any time alone. He allways came to my room and shouted to me how i am a failure and a mistake. I ran away to my mom, but thinks didnt get better. She was full alcoholic and i was depressed. Couple of year ago my uncle from dads side was died and i got a big amount of money (around 100k Euros). Just before i turned 18 my mom stole the money from my account (i was underage and needed a adult for account) and ran away to north and cut contacts. Then i was near suicide, but i called my dad and we got along a little better. Now the problem is i know i am mentally unstable and need a proof from doctor. I dont want to go to army so i need the proof. I think i can do ok in army but cant take the social interactions. If i get it my dad will throw me out, because he dosnt think i am mentaly ill, but that i am a pussy. Allso i secretly crossdress and use sextoys on my anal and pretend to be a girl. I have accepted that thats what i am, but still there is a thought in my mind that am doing something wrong. I know i cant get married or take care of kids.","393":"I (21) am a student from India. I have a lot of back papers\/failed papers. I don't hope to  pass all those. I don't have a bright future. I wasn't like this in my school days and because of my good marks I got admission to a good college. But I changed for worse. Nobody influenced me to change. But I changed. Its all my fault and I don't know to correct it. I bring shame to myself and my parents. I failed myself and everyone who loved me. Sometimes I want to end my worthless life. But sometimes I take it lightly. I am a very reserved person by nature. I don't have anyone I can freely talk these things with. I am a coward and it maybe what got me these much back papers. I don't open books or study even during exams. I run away from studies and other responsibilities. I want an escape from this life. My life won't get any better. It will only get worse. I won't complete college and I won't get a good job. I no longer have any goals or ambitions in life. When I think about suicide what turns me back maybe that how badly that can affect my mother, father and little brother. But I am ruining their lives by being a son\/brother.","394":"I've never talked or posted about my problems publicly before but its come to the point where my thoughts are digging my own grave. Every second of my life suffocates me. I'm all alone and I have no one to talk to or share my feelings with. I'm a second year medical student right now, started medical school in the fall of 2014 but had to split my first year into 2 years because I couldn't handle the stress and my depression at the same time. Came back the second year and somehow managed to finish first year with an 85% average. Now with second year and my USMLE step 1 licensing exam coming up I'm finding myself having a hard time again. It's not that the content is difficult for me, it's my low self-esteem and depressive thoughts that make medical school hard for me. I went to the school counselor to seek help and was referred to the school's psychiatry department this past May. I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me Welbutrin. However, after 5 months of religiously taking Welbutrin it\u2019s not working. Antidepressants can mask symptoms at best but the root problem still remains the same. I tried seeing a psychologist back in 2013 but that didn't seem to be of help either. I hate the very core of my being. I hate my personality, the way I interact with people, how I always get awkward during social situations with new people, and the way I look. I constantly compare myself to other guys who I think look better and have more muscular physiques. Last year I weighed close to 200 lbs. but hit the gym and got down to 155. I gained a little bit of muscle during the process but by no means do I have an extremely muscular physique. Having a good muscular physique has always been my dream but low self-confidence gets the best of me. Whenever, I make a resolution to gain more muscle I always end up self-sabotaging my efforts by sometimes skipping the gym and not sticking to my diets religiously. My mind constantly tells me that it\u2019s useless since I won't be able to put in the dedication to achieve such an accomplishment. As a result months pass by and I don't make any progress. My social life is non-existent. I barely have any friends in medical school. My medical school is like high school where everybody is grouped into cliques and the people like me who are outcasts are left to struggle with the hurdles of med school alone. A part of me feels dead when I see other classmates being socially well integrated in their support groups enjoying medical school. They seem to study and get good grades effortlessly and enjoy it at the same time while being socially active. Whenever I pass by my classmates and look at their faces all I see is people who seem to hate me and are indifferent towards me. I even try to initiate conversations but none of them are receptive. Its like they've already made up their minds about anyone who is not in their clique. Most of them even have good personal lives with a significant other. Meanwhile nobody has ever shown interest in me for my whole life. I go to parties with my parents and people compliment me on my looks but I think they're lying. I'm 6ft tall yet I feel so short in comparison to my classmates who are 6'2, 6'3, 6'4. My mind constantly eats away at me. I feel like I'm going to suffer this life and die alone. I'm an only child and my parents are all I have in this world. My parent's are already in their mid 60's and everyday I worry that I'm going to loose them and be left alone in this world. Most of my extended family is half way across the world in India. Almost all of my cousins are 35 or above and married with children so I never related with any of them. I'm 24 about to turn 25 in 2 months in December. I just feel that I should have accomplished so much in my life by now and should have been comfortable and well adjusted in my skin by now. I should have found my place and people in this world by now. I feel that I'm a thoughtful and caring person. I can't say no to anybody who needs me and always put the needs of others before myself. I'm a religious person and try to pray to God everyday. But for some reason my prayers are falling upon deaf ears. I must genuinely be a flawed person, even God has given up on me.  Everyday that passes by makes me feel like I'm loosing my youth and wasting away the best part of my life. I've tried talking to my parents but they just don't understand. Overall, Indian parents aren't that in tune with emotional issues. After suffering for what seems like an eternity I have no desire to live anymore. All the doors in my life have closed, I can't see any way out of this hell. I just want to die. I have plans to kill myself on my 25th birthday. Either way, it won't make an ounce of difference to anybody. People say that everyone was placed on this Earth for a purpose, I guess mine was to serve as a reminder to people on what suffering is and to count their blessings. I just didn't want to leave this world without getting this off my chest. Thank you to anyone who took the effort to take a few minutes of their day to read this. You have no idea how much this means to me. At least now my soul will be able to depart in peace.","395":"i m in the worst phase of my life. i need to arrange $10000 within 24 hrs but i know its not possible. i have tried every single way but cant get anything.

","397":"2016 is probably the worst year of my life, the culmination of all the underlying insecurity and stress I've been surpressing for years. **YEAR IN REVIEW**In winter 2015 I accidentally enrolled in two courses at once and I was too proud to quit. The very same winter, I was in a minor fender bender at a parking lot with a bicyclist, really nothing dramatic. I rolled out of the driveway and a bicyclist came, so I stepped on the breaks and she stopped in front of me. Long story short, she got mad and punched the car and when she stepped aside I drove off. She ended up reporting me to the police for harassment, assault, failure to give way and hit-and-run, claiming I hit her, twice, with the car on purpose.This stress led to me dropping the course I was taking at the start of spring. I still had my bachelor to do, so I promised myself I would finish it so I could move on with my life, so I applied for the bachelor course and did the practical work this spring. To afford rent, I had to get a summer job and since my thesis data was delayed because I had to wait for optimal plant length, I had to write the report itself over the summer.On top of the court case, the summer job and the thesis, I had a surgery this summer that I have been waiting for for over 9 months which was a phimosis surgery, essentially an adult circumcision. The phimosis itself was a heavy load on my mind the last 22 years. Several times I tried to have sex and they all ended in total embarassment, and I have never been able to have a romantic relationship whatsoever. The surgery itself was one of the worst things I've ever experienced, rough scrubbing, 7 or 8 shots in my penis root for local anesthesia, rough recovery period. Now the wound has healed, but working full time as a personal assistant + thesis writing is driving me off the edge, and reddit's anti-circumcision rhetoric in every threat makes me feel regret and anxiety over having the surgery.**PRESENT DAY**I feel incredible anxiety answering the phone or even checking my email, and even if I see an email from my supervisor I avoid looking at it for days because I know I will feel even worse if I read it. I cry every single day, I feel like I can't breathe, I avoid my roommate because I am so drained after work every day and I don't want to talk to anyone, resulting in almost complete isolation this summer. I have already postponed my bachelor twice at this point because I've been too stressed to write, and I am taking a year off to work starting this fall so I can travel but I have no work lined up after August and I barely have energy to take a shower in the morning. I don't know what to do at this point, I feel like my life is going face down into the mud and I don't have the energy to get up again. My parents are very supportive but they can't help me.I can't keep all these balls rolling, and on top of that I am so incredibly soul-crushingly lonely. I live in a country where circumcision is very rare, so on top of the troubles I've had all along, showing it to a girl makes me feel terror. I don't know how to act in bed in the first place, and sharing my thoughts and feelings and interests and even preference in music\/film\/games makes me feel vulnerable and weak so I try to hide it away instead. I have no motivation to meet people, or work, or play games, or take walks or anything at all really. Nothing is fun anymore. I sleep like shit at night and I'm always tired. I have a trip to India planned for November and a trip on the Siberian railway planned for next summer but I couldn't care less, I'd rather die right now and get it over with. I live in a place of real opportunity and many things in my life are objectively really good, and I feel ungrateful for not enjoying them, I feel selfish. I can't handle feeling like this every night, I just want it to go away.**TL;DR** I've failed in every aspect of life and I'm lost, help me","398":"I've been feeling surprisingly great for the past couple of days, even though I could literally be on the brink of eviction and homelessness.It's like having insurance, a bail out .. for pretty much anything life throws at me.Ironically enough, the peace of mind that thinking about suicide brings me, allows me to keep going in life with a clear, rational head. I no longer have any reason to panic about anything. I've been applying for jobs, going to work interviews, working restlessly on my upcoming YouTube videos, cooking, cleaning my room, moisturizing, doing my eyebrows, etc.I used to be scared of the dark as a kid, when I was around 7-9. So scared, one day I peed my pants while sitting on the couch with the lights on, because I was so scared to walk through the dark hallway. My parents were away at the time, apartment was dead quiet. Nowadays I could watch horror films before going to bed, think about them while I'm lying in bed .. and still have a good night's sleep. Think about the movie Lights Out, yeah. My kind of movie. You can't kill that which is already dead. If anything, it is me who has become the phantom, the creeping silhouette waving at you from outside your bedroom window, from the corner of your eye. I should already be fucking dead, but never mind. I have been granted a unique power. I have been granted immunity from Earthly troubles. Nothing really matters to me .. debt, work, responsibility, bills, careers, homework, grades, marriage, etc. Stick it up your ass. Maybe I only pretend to care about these things, because I'm jealous of the living. However, as time goes by, this jealousy is transformed into second hand embarrassment. I'm supposed to be dead. There's no way I could have possibly continued living up till this point. I spent 2 years on welfare since the age of 19 .. that money could have gone to somebody who was disabled, instead of my own de facto existence.Many people have abused this power, the power of not caring about a damn thing in the world, the power of being unpunishable by the consequences of the real world. I want to be remembered as somebody, who used this power in order to do good things, such as saving lives, perhaps .. or donating lots of money to charity by selling shit loads of drugs or something, and then ending my life. A British couple once carried out such a plot. They got 3 years behind bars. Sadly, such good deeds always go unnoticed .. it's always terrorists and mass shooters who get all the media coverage, vile scum.I don't have any fucking friends ... so peddling drugs will probably never work. (don't raid me .. I don't have shit in this room. I'm an alcoholic, not a drug addict.)Starting a torrent site may be a better idea for a suicidal charity fundraiser, actually. As far as I can recall, Pirate Bay raked 4 million dollars every year. If I could make one tenth of that, it would still be lots of money. It's a victimless crime, literally nobody is harmed, and it pays well. Give 75% to charity, use the rest to sustain what is left of my existence .. and the deed is done. If I get busted, I can always finish it before my court date. I get what I want, which is death and freedom from Life and it's shittiness .. and thousands of people end up having money for their cancer surgeries. Sounds like a plan.God, I feel so much better now that I wrote this. What's your favourite beer, anyway? I like India Pale Ale. I love cats, too. &lt;3","399":"I'm 19,  my looks are probably 2\/10, I'm fat and 6 feet tall, I live in India, the southern part, I've got a dark tan, I'm not smart, I'm getting a shitty education(undergrad chemistry). I can't speak fluently, I always mask my true self, and I'm miserable as hell. Also I'm an atheist so I don't have the luxury of having faith in stuff. ","400":"Hello guysI guess I should explain my story a little so my situation makes sense. My gf passed away in grade 10 in a car accident because I insisted her to watch my final game. It was supposed to be my last cricket game in India before I left for Canada with my family. I always blamed myself for her death and just felt like shit. In highschool, I didn't really fit in because I came in grade 10 when most students had already made their groups in grade 9. I didn't speak the language that well, so I was just afraid to talk in general and I was poor at understanding the social structure of western society.I went to university and made 2 friends who got me into League of Legends and I played that game like no tomorrow. I didn't make much friends as a result and my performance in school wasn't the greatest. I ended up switching programs and make great progress. I did my work, helped with researched and talked to people. I am known to be one of the most extroverted people on the campus yet I do not have a single close friend. I decided to date and obviously didn't succeed. I just came back from a date and everything went really well but 2 hours later she told me that her boyfriend would be coming over. She didn't even tell me that she had a bf!?!! Ok, a'ight.....it happens. I feel like I am just garbage who probably talks a lot and people just want to make fun of me. Here is the thing though: I know that because of my low self-esteem, which probably look a hit after my gf died, I tend to engage in confirmation bias and only pick on instances where I have underperformed. However, I just feel terrible saying that I have finished my 5 years at university without dating anyone at all. It probably is trivial but I am afraid of telling people the truth and lie about being in relationships. It is generally not accepted if you are a guy with less-experience and I feel bad about myself. Even though I have things I can be happy about like my research in social anxiety, organized crime, terrorism, etc etc.....I feel that I have generally failed at life because I haven't really achieved anything besides academia. I don't know if this is the proper place, but I thought I should probably ask for help because I know that I tend to keep all these negatives feelings inside me and do other stupid shit. I feel adding to that fact that I am always surrounded by negativity when I am doing research (terrorism everywhere, hatred for people, etc etc)...it adds and amplifies the negative feelings inside me because I feel my research is ultimately going to be useless. Politicians are still going to do their stuff because they get paid, law enforcement is still going to do things their way despite the facts.....I am probably not going to get a job and will die alone somewhere in a corner. ah fuck it.......feels bad man  ","401":"I've been contemplating suicide for some time now, and I'm leaning more towards getting it done with. I live in a third world country(India, to be specific.), where life is just not worth it anymore. Ever since I was little, I've had one specific goal. One dream. One ambition in life and I know most of you are going to laugh at me when I say this, but I really wanted to be an astronaut when I would grow up. I wanted to travel to space and view the earth and moon and the sun and the stars. And yes, I know that I can do that using Google, but I want to physically achieve it, feel the feeling of being in space among the stars and truly, I think it would be beautiful. And yes, I know you can do that playing video games too(I've played Mass Effect, yes), but it's not reality. I've finished my Bachelor's degree in Engineering with \"ok\" grades. And boy, I've suffered through the whole ordeal of education. My scores of the entrance test for engineering weren't that great so I ended up in an institution which took me 2 hours of travel everyday to get to and back home and the faculty was really bitchy, without having any knowledge of the field whatsoever(some were good, most were really bad). They treated most of us students like crap. Always favored the ass lickers and made sure students like me faced a hard time. So, basically it was hell for me, but I still survived through it because it was my only choice of leaving the country to join any human space program(India has none and will never have one). So, now that it's over I go looking for requirements to join maybe NASA or something. And guess what do I find? I need to be a citizen of the country to be part of their space program. The U.S. won't grant me a citizenship(getting a Green Card is an achievement alone, but not good enough for NASA). Russia is the same story. So I just realized, whatever I do, I can't be an astronaut. I just can't. And it's really sad, because it's something I'm so passionate about. The worst thing is, it's not even my fault. I'm just unlucky I guess to be born in a place with nothing for me. Over the last few weeks, my parents have tried to convince me to find other interests, but I can't. In my anger, sometimes I've even blamed them for not migrating when they had the chance(They had two chances, but my father's a stubborn man and his ego and pride got in the way). Anyhow, I do feel terrible about it, and about the life I live. I have only a few good friends. Never had a girlfriend and I doubt I ever will. This was the only thing worth living for and now it's gone. I will never be able to do what I wanted (You can all laugh now). I suffered for nothing. I have no purpose in this life anymore. Death seems like the only way out. Give me one good reason not to...

As in I am in no risk of killing myself any time soon but I am an international student in US who hails from India. And I DO NOT want to go back as I just don't fit in that country. I don't think I will be able to survive there. I was never happy there. I want to find a way to settle here. Keeping immigration and it's merits aside it's not an easy process and every time i think of the idea that it might fail I tell myself: \"Worst case scenario I will kill myself\" and I have started thinking about it for a lot of things. For instance if my boyfriend graduates and decides to break up with me due to moving away (we don't know what will happen yet) then I think, \"I guess I could always kill myself if it comes down to it\". And it started slow but it seems to getting more and more frequent and I am scared but I am also scared of living with the alternative.  And I don't know how to change how I feel.

The so-called surgeon made the incisions under my eyes BELOW my lashes - totally VISIBLE on my face so I look like a FREAK.  My face lift is a disaster.  My neck was pulled so tight I can hardly lift my head (HUGE SCAR underneath -- even though they told me it would be a 'tiny' 1\/2 inch incision).  I feel totally suicidal and almost jumped out of a window the other night -- the only thing that stopped me was the knowledge of my 17-year old son at home.  I had this surgery in India (no one in my family knows yet), but I will be flying home in 2 days.  I am horrified by their reaction.  Not only will I NOT be able to pay for revision surgery, but with the scars the way they have been made (me being totally butchered), there is only so much they could do anyway to fix me.  I have now seen a VERY reputable surgeon in Mumbai, as I was seeing infection &amp; incisions not healing - he told me that whoever did this surgery, was 'clearly not skilled regarding these procedures'...  That's putting it MILDLY.  My life is ruined.  I am currently unemployed, but was planning on looking for work immediately upon my return from India.  NO ONE WILL HIRE me looking like this!!!

I am fresher so i didnt got any job even after trying my ass off for months. I always wanted to be an Entrepreneur. I was smart, intelligent but real life certainly do not want these skill sets. I always shy to speak about my life to anyone but this subreddit is a great platform where i could actually share that i wanted for long and also right now i am on Zolpy10 pill which generally hinders your depression and makes you drizzy and relieved. 4 years ago- My mother got ILD (chronic lung disease) during my college. I decided to stay with my mom and also study. I did pretty well for years. Then, My father lost his job. My father was diabetic so the time came when we had to amputate his toe. I was simultaneously taking care of my father in hospital as well studying for my finals. Good thing happened that i passed my graduation with really good scores. Well it does not end here. Here, How the miseries of my life starts- We shifted from the place. I didnt get any job. My father job lost. So we decided to start a logistics business. We started and mantained for like a year but did nt find any profits and since we were running out of money and resources. We sold the carrier and business. Well It just dont stop here, My father who was so fit and brave,able to fight anybody for their family , dies due to sudden heartstroke. We were devastated. Few days later, One of my old friend called to ask me if i could partner with him on his website\/blog. I agreed in order to feed my family. After 4 months of working my ass off for his website, The only thing that came in my hands is nothing. He sneaked away saying that i am not worth the effort.

Luckily, I got to spend three years of university away from them because I was in a different city. A time I've grown and learned so much, and also took pretty good care of myself. But, unfortunately, I've started my masters in the same city as my parents, an expensive city and I definitely cannot afford to move out while being a full time student. (Hard to get a job that could pay the bills as a student here)Which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so damn overprotective and repressive. Always monitoring where I'm going, what I'm doing, which friends I'm with. I have to text them where I am all the time. Answer their calls immediately or they get crazy. Wear what they consider 'appropriate' or get heavily slut shamed and humiliated. I'm barely allowed nights out, and even if I am I have to lie about what I'm actually doing, like a fucking kid. It's actually not this bad for a lot of kids here in India today. Sure, some of them have it worse but most of the people in my circles are seriously amused at how bad I have it. I'm not amused. I can't handle it any more. I spend every night crying myself to sleep because I feel so trapped. I worry I may never get myself out of this situation, or at least not soon enough to stay sane.They're not exactly bad people, I recognise that they care about me. I wonder if they care about me as much as their reputation, though, hmm. And I suppose my situation isn't so bad either. Some people have it way worse. I just can't deal with it any more. I thought I could, but I was wrong. I really, really can't.I want to die. I fantasise about what things would be like after I commit suicide. It's intoxicating. I actually feel like I'd be doing some good. Maybe my parents would reflect on their mistakes, they'd think about where they went wrong, and I'd make it very, very clear about what it was. Maybe that'll bring some damn change. That thought gets better and better to me with each passing day.Somehow I know I shouldn't feel that way, and I should be hopeful about things changing (after all, this is why I'm posting to suicidewatch, or I'd just have offed myself). But it's getting harder and harder to live in this environment. I find it so difficult to derive joy from anything, even fleetingly, knowing that ultimately I have to answer to my parents.Thanks for listening.","407":"I am feeling very suicidal everytime my parents annoy me to death wanting me to marry a stranger girl from India. I have been dealing with this for a while, I have a goal I am obese and lost about 40 lbs so far, I have a few more to go, and I realize I need to be my best self that includes wealth, health and personality. I have been improving that area of my life for the past 6 months and I still have a long way to go. I am 30 years old now.

I support my family financially as my parents did so much for me when I was a kid and now they are old and this is something I WANT TO do, not because I HAVE to. I am happy to support them financially every month.But, every friends of mine who got arranged married, or even married ended up in divorce and losing half of their stuff and paying child support at this moment. At least majority of them, so I don't want to fall in that trap without knowing a girl very well.But my parents keep saying I am getting older and I MUST marry, and I had plans to go visit them and they were planning on surprise marriage when I visit them.Today I had a heated argument with my father in India, over the phone, I have so much respect for and I have never talked to him this way. I told him NO! This is my life, who are you to interfere. Then there was this silence on the phone and he said okay, I thought it is our duty to make sure you have everything in your life but if you don't want to, I don't know what else I can do. We are also getting older and we would love for our generation and genes to continue. I did not stop there, I went far and said is it not enough that I am supporting you financially, why don't you both leave me alone, I don't ever want to see you again, I will just send you money and I am cancelling my trip, please do not ever call me again and hung up.After that, I feel extremely guilty for disrespecting my dad and speaking the way I spoke to him and I feel very suicidal now. I want to send all the money I have now in my savings to them and just go quiet for a week and jump off Niagara.I have come along way since last 6 months getting better physique, and everthing and now I can't deal with the guilt and also getting trapped in this arranged marriage thing, I don't know what else I can do. The guilt is killing me now and I am always worried if my parents will pass away and often have nighmares about getting a call that one of them is in the hospital.I don't think I can live through that. At the same time, I feel like I am stuck at this right now.I have no one to talk to personally about this, as I am all alone in Canada, the friends I have are more like aquantainces and I don't usally discuss personal matters with anyone.

From time to time i do get very suicidal but I feel that lies a lot on being back in the UK and not traveling, hence why I posted here (I've posted in the bipolar support group too as I'm not sure if I could post in both). Anyway I went to visit what I thought would be a psych today, turns out it was just a person who refers me to see a psych so I got put on another waiting list to see a psych after 4 weeks. This as you can imagine is quite frustrating, I left Australia a couple of months ago as I thought it was going to be good for me to have the support of my family and get medical specialist attention quicker but turns out it was quite the opposite.So Now I have choices, I've already booked a flight to Australia for next week on a whim because the flights were cheap. I fly to Perth from the UK for \u00a3380 and the plan would be to make my way to Melbourne to work at a ladies house helping her out with certain chores, practicing yoga (she works for a yoga studio) and meditation and hopefully gain my second year visa in Australia which would require 88 days of regional work. I've emailed her today to make sure this is all ok as I don't think she quite believes I'm going to fly all the way from the UK so I'm going to wait and hear what she has to say. Down falls of this choice is I'd be quite secluded, in an area where I'm not going to know many people but I guess I can get to know people.My other two choices are this. My flight to Australia flys via Bali, a place known for being spiritual. I'm really trying to explore my spirtuality if you can't tell as I feel like i really need to discover myself and try and figure out how to be content with life. I received an email back from a place today that said I can stay there for 10 days and do a pretty intense silent mediation routine aimed at dealing with the stressers of life. It's pretty intense, like no talking at all for the majority of the time while there. Have to dress modestly, no use of technology, no books etc. So it's pretty hardcore. It would be an extreme change and maybe what I need but also could it be too much? This is the site if you want to check it out? http:\/\/www.java.dhamma.org\/indexeng.htm They even have a disclaimer on the email saying \"By completing the accompanying application to participate in a ten-day Vipassana meditation course, the applicant acknowledges the foregoing warning and in consideration of being permitted to participate in the course knowingly grants to the organisers of this course, Vipassana Meditation, and its associated organisations including Vipassana Centres and teachers, a complete, total and unequivocal release of any and all liability for any adverse mental or physical consequences which may result directly or indirectly from such participation.\"So yeah a bit worrying haha.Anyway 3rd choice, I can fly to Portugal tomorrow and meet up with a bunch of friends I met travelling last year and travel with them for a while. They love to party which is something I will have to try and avoid for the time being s obviously drink and drugs are not good for people with mental issues but they all love me and are super supportive. I then have the opportunity to either travel with one group to Turkey or with my one friend to Croatia to work for a while then maybe India (I'd probably have to forget about Australia if I took this trip or at east postpone it for a while). This would be good for me to be surrounded by friends but also the temptation of slipping back into the party lifestyle would be there, however i do think I've grown enough to avoid this and just enjoy being with people and traveling.My final I guess option is to just stay home I guess but as of now things aren't really improving. Doctors take so long to see, I keep getting put on and taken off medication and my whole faith in the system has just gone so I kind of don't really see staying here as an option anymore. I'm kind of writing this all down for myself but also to get a few opinions from you guys too. So yeah, any help appreciated. A bit of a quick background, I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, mood swings, self harm, thoughts of going crazy and all sorts of stupid stuff (there is a possibility i could be bipolar). At the minute I feel quite normal, I think getting out of here's a good choice but just making the right decision is difficult. I'm kind of swaying towards Portugal at the moment because then i have friends around me but if I'm going tomorrow that's going to be quite the rush job. Anyway guys, any help appreciated.","411":"Here is the message: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zG3yKk7.jpg.He made a post couple of days back about being frustrated with reservations in India, on the Indian subreddit.

I am young (22) and I am doing great in university and I have friends and a great family and lots of potential. But everyday I wake up and hate myself and want to die. As an act of desperation and existential crisis I attempted suicide at 18, rented a hotel room, slit my wrists and swallowed 50,000 mg of tylenol. Obviously that wasn't enough to kill me, and I feel like I didn't know what sadness was until afterwards, because these last 4 years have been hell.I've been sad for as long as I can remember being conscious of sadness (maybe 6 or 7?). And I rarely have more than a week of genuine happiness, even though I've done things that would make most people happy. Sometimes I am more manic than happy and that is uncomfortable in it's own way. I was a bulimic for 8 years, now 1 year into recovery and I was hoping that would make me feel better but it didn't. In and out of shitty relationships with emotionally abusive men, and serious rifts with friends and family after the attempt. My emotions are all over the place and I feel things very deeply so it's hard to have a functional relationship.I've tried everything: self-help books, about 9 years of therapy, 6 different medications, a trip to India that included volunteering and living in an ashram, meditation\/yoga, running away, staying put, self medicating with alchohol\/drugs, experimenting with hallucinogens. Nothing seems to work. I make a few steps forward and then ten back. At this point I know my family and friends would be devastated, but they've watched me suffer for years and they know how terribly I need to escape, I can't keep letting them down getting better and then worse again. So I feel like somewhere within them they would understand. I'm scared of the pain f most suicide methods, and I'm scared of how horrible life would be if I attempted and failed and had brain damage or woke up in the hospital to my grandma's crying face one more time. But at what point does the sadness override the fear?I've told myself for the past 4 years\u2026\"just wait till\u2026 and if you feel better after that you don't have to do it. But \"feeling better\" never comes and I'm tired of trying and waiting. Ultimately I hate myself and feel unworthy of love and have a really hard time making it through most days. It seems like there is this rich, beautiful life just inches away from me that I can't reach, and I'm becoming very tired of trying.

I wish happy birthdays on facebook, or by text. But those 'friends', don't even wish me on *my* birthday. So I stopped that shit since the last year.Now I'm just exhausted. I don't find any interest in anything really - my side projects which I think could turn into million dollar startups, or going out, or meeting new people (I'd have to cold approach). I have no interest in good food. I just goto work everyday, 13+ hours of the day get dedicated to office life. I come back home and I barely have anytime to think about anything else except eat and browse some porn and then goto sleep.I've no girlfriend, but that's okay. I have cold approached tonnes of girls (and I mean shit tonnes - like, 25-30 every week), in the last two years since I got my job (before I had no confidence, mostly because of coming across as a bum with nothing to offer). But I got only rejection. Each and every single one of them.I am fine with that too - we can't just force someone to like us the if like them. I've stopped going out completely - going out to meet women was one of the reasons I ever used to go out. I don't like wandering mindlessly in the malls etc. And my city is nowhere near as picturesque as one might think.So. No friends, no love life, a job I really don't give a shit about and bills that I'm plain bored and tired of paying. I've had it. I mean, there's really no reason to be such a living waste of life. To be wasting resources. Heck, if I resign today, I'm pretty sure someone pretty deserving of my job would be happier than me to fill in my shoes. Sure, my landlord would have a hard time finding another peaceful tenant who pays the rent on time, but who gives a fuck..Browsing Reddit\/imgur\/hackernews really doesn't fulfill some inner need\/want that I don't even know what it is, and I'm just getting emptier and emptier inside, very less emotions and sympathy left.

","415":"So this is kind of a long story but it starts with me being hired by a tech startup in San Francisco (where I used to live). Before me it was just a team of six men and I was the first female. I was an iOS developer. Their app still hasn't shipped yet.So at the startup I constantly felt that I was treated differently then all the other men by the founder. Some of the other men gave me weird looks and one of them asked me out on a date. When I said no, he beat me up (violently, he broke my leg, I'm not sure how no one noticed because we were outside the office on the street where there were people), spoke rubbish about me to the founder, and I was subsequently fired. I knew I could easily be hired somewhere else, but was terrified of the possibility of bumping into him.Due to this fear, I gathered up my things and moved to NYC. I was hired by another (larger) company and was working there until this happened (not related to company, read below). I have been offered re-employment when I am ready to go back to work (currently on benefits).But then I was travelling to India on holiday over Christmas (21 Dec through 1 Jan was the intended trip length). It was probably foolish of me to go alone. The first 7 days of the trip were wonderful. I was in east India when this happened though. I was walking towards a train and then a local grabbed me on the neck from behind and started beating me. He probably chose me because I looked like a tourist (which I was). Anyways so he beat me up real bad (My legs were paralysed after this due to nerve injury and I have only regained a little movement in my left leg). Then he dragged me behind a building where there was no one else, stripped off my clothes and forcibly had sex with me. After that he took my wallet with my credit cards and cash in it. Then he left me to rot and ran off. Obviously because this was in India and I am American this is hard to take to court.After that I eventually found someone kind enough to take me to a hospital. The fees were expensive but I'm glad I got treated. I paid for it in my primary credit card which was still in my pocket. Then I was taken to an aeroport and I flew back to NYC.After I got back to NYC I have been questioning the purpose of my existence. If I am going to keep being someone's maltreated toy then what is the purpose of staying alive, other than for my family. Since returning I have been diagnosed with depression and trust issues. I wasn't smart enough to take someone else with me to India. That should have been a no brainer. Why am I smart enough to do anything else?","416":"I had the happiest childhood a kid could as for, probably. Then came my first relationship, when I was about 13, while I was still in school. It lasted for about a couple of years, and when it ended, it did hurt for a couple of months, but nothing tragically wrong. Met my last GF soon after, and dated her for the next 4 years. I felt like nothing could ever go wrong between us back then. I truly believed that she was the one. (Maybe I still do? Sure do feel like I fucked up real bad by losing her.) But her parents weren't particularly fond of me, and so, well, I tried impressing them however I could. Soon, school ended and it was time to choose a college. I wanted to be a Sound Engineer and even somehow managed to get a 10% scholarship to a pretty decent college, but my dad couldn't cough up the money that it'd take. Both my parents wanted me to be an Engineer, just like all the other kids in the neighbourhood with high paying jobs. Plus, it isn't exactly considered a \"wise\" investment in India, since engineers are generally better paid. So, I had a lil chat with my then \"SO\"... She told me that she'd try to support me no matter what, but things would get extremely complicated between us if her parent found out that I wasn't pursuing a more \"elegant\" field like Engineering -- as opposed to \"sound engineering\" which no one in the country would consider \"real engineering\" despite the patience and hard work that it takes.Anyways, long story short -- I decided that it was a much safer bet to pursue Electrical engineering at a B-Grade college in my city. It was the same college that my SO's elder sister was studying in. I chose that same college, coz I wanted an excuse to be closer to my SO and I felt that being in the same college would be an excellent excuse (if nothing else) to drop by her house sometimes. Fast forward One year: I didn't get the \"top-notch\" scores in my first semester that I would've required to impress her parents (75% in Electrical Engineering as compared to her Elder sister's 90%) and she was pissed off that I hadn't tried\/studied hard enough. I'm still not convinced that I did try hard enough. :(As time went on, somehow, despite the substantial time that we spent together - the distance between us was growing. She once lamented to me that the initial \"spark\" in our relationship was gone. I had no idea what she was talking about, since my entire life revolved around her by now. I intended to finish my education, get a (high paying) job, and marry her - make her mine, so that even her parents could no longer keep us apart, or judge me for not being good enough for their daughter.Soon, she started behaving rather *erratically*. One day she told me that she was trying to teach a lesson to one of our mutual acquaintance, who was cheating on his girl-friend. This acquaintance hadn't previously met her face-to-face. Her overly-elaborate plan was to herself introduce herself as a potential \"date\" to him, and somehow emotionally manipulate him to make him realize how much it hurts when someone cheats on you. I wasn't able to handle this -- for some odd reason, and felt like she was \"bored\" of me.. or even found this other guy more attractive than me. Things got somewhat bitter between us for sometime, but with time ( a few months), things got a little better again. However, I guess I was still hurting on the inside. Guess I've always been a sissy. Eventually, I found out through one of her friends, that she was cheating on me. This hurt me much more than I can ever explain in words. I tried to ask her why she'd do that, and we tried to make it work after a short hiatus, but nothing worked. I was always bitter, and might have even emotionally tortured her somewhat, but I swear I had no control over my actions by then. I was hurting real bad, and she was the only one I could talk to, coz as I said -- I had built my entire life around her, and she was my only emotional support system. I even tried to kill myself. At that point I thought this might at the very least get her attension. But something was wrong. And in a very short time, she had changed too much. The person I had loved for all these years was gone. This is where her story ends. And I feel like I'm still stuck there -- even 5 years after that breakup. I eventually became isolated &amp; reclusive. I was always a student who would get a decent grade, but after this ordeal, I suddenly felt like nothing mattered anymore. I stopped trying - in everything. My grades suffered drastically. Before this point, not a day passed by when I wouldn't play my guitar for at least an hour each day. Now my guitar rots away in a corner of my room, and I haven't touched it in the last few years. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. I learnt through searching on the internet, that I may be depressed. I told my parents about it, but they just thought I was over-reacting by demanding to visit a psychiatrist. (In India, it's a stigma that only \"mad\" or people with serious mental disorders i.e., social pariahs would only ever need the help of psychiatrists.)For the last several years I've tried to live with this. But Now I feel numb on the inside, and every night, I seem to be asking myself, what's the point of living on? And the only reason I'm alive is coz my parents spent a LOT of money, time and love to raise me, and I can't just kill myself! They deserve better, and I intend to give it to them. But I just can't seem to bring myself to do it. I can't study, I don't have a job (graduated 2 years ago) and most of the time, I can't even get myself to get out of the house for any reason at all. I just lay here, all day... on my bed and surf the internet -- searching endlessly for something that might make me feel better. I honestly believe that I can't do anything right anymore. Before this entire ordeal, I could get extraordinary results in almost anything even if I tried very little. Now, no matter how much I try, I always seem to fail. I can't concentrate or focus. and have no emotional stability. I haven't even approached any girl for dating ever since the breakup. She seems to have left a large gaping hole, an eternal void in my heart that nothing seems to be able to fill. I still try to convince my parents to take me to a shrink -- but they still think I'm over-reacting. Help me, plz. If possible.**I feel like I'm already dead on the inside.**Nothing matters anymore, nothing brings me any pleasure. I fail at anything and everything that I try. I hate my own face, I'm over-weight as fuck and I'm sure my friends find me annoying by now as well. I've gotten pretty good in keeping those suicidal thoughts out of my head, but honestly, I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.. SOrry for this super long rant. If anyone of you read this entire thing, thank you, and sorry for wasting your time. Nevertheless, it's appreciated. Thank you.   ","417":"today is my birthday. this is a time when I'm supposed to be happy. but I'm not. I'm on \/r\/suicidewatch. I've felt like this for a long time though, to the point where I'm unphased. Since I was at least 8 I've felt like this. From my father's beatings, to the lonliness in school, to the taunting I got from failed romantic advances, to the one person who showed interest in me and had sex with me only to tell me she only liked me because I liked her. I was angry, for a very long time. I understand now, though. Why I'm so miserable, why I never have a happy birthday. I understand why no one wants to be my friend, why that girl left me for someone much better than me. I understand why im a loser. I understand why my mom, the only person who has ever been kind to me, decided to go to India without telling me. My hand is bleeding. My throat hurts from screaming. There are scars on my neck from where the belt clung. There's broken glass on the floor from where I punched the mirror. I understand why this happening. why im lonely and sad.I understand I'm not meant to be happy. I'm the universe's failed experiment, an anomaly. My life is probably terrible because I'm supposed to kill myself. That's why I'm alone and miserable. so the universe can make sure I have no emotional attachments. I'm supposed to kill myself. I'm not meant to be happy. I never will be. I might as well give the universe what it wants. I just wish I had the means. ","418":"I am about to fail out of college and have a 130k debt undersigned by my parent's siblings who have green cards. If I flunk out, I would have to return to my third-world country without my degree. My parents would probably disown me and they would become pariahs with their relatives and in their community. They knew I had been doing poorly in my degree but thought it was better now.I would have no job prospects if I return to that country without a degree which would allow me to pay off that debt. My relatives probably cannot pay off the debt unless I manage to get a job based on a degree I cannot get. They and I would probably have to declare bankruptcy. I have destroyed many people's livelihoods and dreams because of my colossal failure to work hard. It doesn't matter that I hate my field of study, the reason for this situation is me and my laziness.I tried to think of jobs which wouldn't require a degree that could accept someone from a third-world country (India) and can pay off my debt but I cannot. I am considering killing myself in an accident so my parents can use my life-insurance policy. Maybe there are other options but I cannot see them at this moment. I have been emailing my adviser since they told me over email 2 hours ago that I will probably flunk out and they have not replied. If I cannot keep myself in college tomorrow. I will probably do something over the weekend.","419":"That i failed my life? i screwed up my education, job prospects are beyond anything, don't have any friends? I hate talking to anyone even my fucking family the only people who care about me well not really only my mom cares and the only thing that will make her happy is me getting a job, completing my education but i don't want to do it because i am a idiotic loser but every idiot who analyzed me tells me i have amazing talking skills those don't get you anything maybe i am good at talking to a single person but if there is even more than one person my confidence plummets to me it's like a war.Everyone is now upping up their resumes, graduating and getting valuable job experience but what does this loser do? NOTHING NOT A DAMN THING do you know why? because nothing makes me happy, nothing excites me i am never happy with anything i have always been that guy who just went with the flow to me this was life of every person get a good education. get a good job, marry, have kids, raise kids watch your parents die and deal with that pain thanks to your new family, retire, either see you're children getting spoiled or decent w\/e and then die or see you're grand kids either they accept you or depending on you're children they bully you or love you.But i screwed up the first one that is a good education my educational qualifications are so bad it's not funny i am not stupid but i kinda am i passed the learning disability test but i am still an idiot.My childhood dreams was that idiotic sexist fantasy i am the breadwinner and my wife and my children wait for me, which soon changed with both of us working but my wife still talking care of them and me caring a little and then it changed to my wife having a amazing job while me having a crappy one and taking care of my kids and finally being a sane person and realizing what a idiotic and selfish man i really am then i came to my senses and promised i would never ever inflict myself on any woman or man i am too much of an idiot and naive and probably have no idea how this world works.No animal in the animal kingdom is like me.I am not wallowing in self pity or anything i tried exercise, studying or really forcing myself to complete my college and i managed to clear the easy non-technical subjects. But i can't grasp a single thing of any of these damn technical subjects i am 5 years behind. nobody not even an a single teacher in the college even knows who the fuck i am only my principal knows me. I can walk now without exhaustion but does that make me happy no! nah  i was kidding i am wallowing.You know i could get off my ass and learn from the internet to try passing them, i could get muscles or some shit, practice some speech skills, learn something but i don't want to i don't think i want to, all i seem to want is scrape through till my mother dies and then suicide. My parents(mom really) is against tutors because they are expensive and i will ruin that by skipping or failing like i always have grandparents don't want anyone in the house they feel unsafe.But now i have gotten more and more selfish i mean why the fuck should i live till her death that will only cause me more heartache i told her multiple times to forget her me and live her own life happily but she doesn't listen however talking to her about mental issues lead to manipulation, hostility, screaming, hate, blame game and other shit. But is it her fault? she has worked hard for everything even though my sister hates me she works hard she predicted after my mom dies i will kill myself and take shortcuts like i always have. But do i get angry? NO do i hate myself? NO do i hate her? yes But do i want to prove her wrong? NO.I am not a failure because failures try then try and fail and give up or they try again and again but me? i haven't even tried i already gave up at 22 i don't think i have it in me to change i have always needed a ringmaster in my life not one thing i did where i was in charge and what do when i am in charge? waste. Talking to help lines if pointless they don't really care about mental health here in India.I mean what will she say? I am lazy? I need responsibility? I need to understand the dynamic that no one will hold your hand whatever? I need to experience how hard it really is to earn even a single coin? OR will it be medication till u die lol(it hasn't helped me). My family isn't interested in therapists or psychologists. I am alone and i love it and hate it.TLDR- OP IS A IDIOT LOSER THERE IS NO SOLUTION IN THIS SITUATION OP ALREADY KNOWS WHATS WRONG AND SOLUTION BUT IS A TRUE COWARD AND LOSER.If i look at myself in a technical point of view i am a loser let's see i don't brush, bath, eat properly, play games but don't really master any of them i suck at them all of them i am never even in the top 50 players on a multiplayer game and i usually either play on the easy difficult or cheat engine that shit. But are these really problems Children are forced in slave labour, they have to drink dirty water, stale food and survive a fanatical military, religious maniacs and they still want to live they still want education i know comparison's are wrong this is technical so it's allowed. Will anyone even read this shit? probably not i should have died in my two attempts my first one was a lame cry for help but it didn't work my second was an anger one it was close but meh i think i am better off dead because i actually am dead living like i have read that 5 times and i honestly think the solution doesn't exist my mind is just screwed up too much i am beyond redemption because i don't even seek it even if it's right here free! i am like a doctor specializing in livers who has slight family problems and to combat them drink 6 bottles of alcohol a day.","420":"This is the worst day of my life, I feel suicidal. I haven't had such thoughts before, this is my first time. Why do people\/society Impress so much on education ? And why do parents (in my case dad) put so much pressure on their kids ?

Is there no value to us without education ?Tonight (just a few minutes back) my dad called,we had talks just like every other day but when i told him about my education ?

Hope people learn about me here on...","421":"I need to get this out there and out of my system. This will be a long post. I'm sorry if this post annoys you in any way.I am an international student from India, and I'm currently pursuing my higher education in San Diego. I got accepted into the bioengineering field, and I was elated because of how lucky I was that I got accepted into a prestigious university for this major. I was planning on going into medicine (i.e take my MCATs around my 3rd year of college). The first 6 months of college was great. I made a lot of friends, I was loved and accepted, I did well in school (got As and Bs). Come third quarter of the year, I suddenly fell into a slump for no apparent reason. I still did relatively well in class, but I found myself skipping classes more often. Friends that I had made just a few months ago left me. Fast forward to the summer, when I took summer session, I found myself truly alone. I did badly, and I put on a lot of weight. I made decisions that I still regret to this day. After summer session, I found myself in my sophomore year. It was also when I met my to-be girlfriend. Things were looking up, I thought. But I found myself unable to get out of bed and unable to go to class. I failed that quarter. I was put on \"prone to academic disqualification\". Things didn't change for the next quarter either. I find myself plying league of legends all day, or watching youtube. I can never seem to be proactive about anything. I cannot make myself go to a therapist. My parents are angry that I'm wasting a $60000 a year opportunity, and they want me to come back home. The university is ready to kick me out of college if I fail my classes this quarter. I haven't told my parents that my university is ready to kick me out of college for fear of abuse. My parents don't understand my situation, and I've been getting into fights with my girlfriend (who incidentally is also the only person I ever talk to in a day. I have no friends). My relationship is slowly going down the drain. I find myself always wanting to cry and do nothing about anything. I miss midterms and quizzes on the regular. I don't want to leave this college. I don't want to leave her either, even after all the shit I put her through. I'm not motivated. I don't even know what I want in life anymore. I am no longer a bioengineering major. My gpa is at 2.2. It doesn't look like I'm ever getting into med school. I'm too much of a coward to even consider killing myself. I am scared of death. But at this rate, I don't know whats going to happen. This post might not be as tragic as anything else on this subreddit, heck it might be nothing compared to what I've read on this page. But I'm getting nowhere. I don't believe in therapy, as the psychologist is going to tell me things that I've heard countless times before. Please help me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sorry if this post confuses you. I suck at writing. I suck at everything. I used to have interests and hobbies, but nothing interests me anymore.","422":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AsianParentStories\/comments\/20vusm\/indian_were_still_asian_parents\/(Talk of severe parental abuse in the above link) He seems to be in India.

I live in an apartment with a \"friend\" and his fiance, I find them more annoying really... They are a little packrat-ish, and I've pick up some of that. Not that I've always been the neatest person. My parents are currently in Germany because of USAF orders. I don't know what else to explain really... I just don't want to live anymore.  I was never a good student, I was never a good son, in my eyes. I no longer know what I want to do in life other than just disappear and die. I have no motivation or willingness to get a job, I feel like it's just a pointless endeavor that perpetuates a pointless life. I've wasted so much of my parents money. I don't want to get help, I don't want a doctor. I don't want a priest. I don't want a friend. I just want to die. Every once in awhile, roughly every 4-5 days, I have a brief, 1-5 hour, window of motivation where I start to rationalize things that I \"should do\" in terms of what is deemed useful to society or my family.  I see myself like a failure, I guess similar to the pressure that holds a hikikomori in their room. Whenever I see something motivational, I break down and cry because I know I'll never be something worthwhile. I won't be someone influential. I won't be someone important to the world. Just a lowly 1 in 7 billion. People in india, or any 3rd world nation could kill for a life like mine.... but I don't want to do anything with it. I don't want to move forward. I don't want to live.

I live in a society that grows and stubbornly reaches higher for greatness.... and yet I just want to throw it all away. I don't get it... I don't feel like an important character in my own story.... So why bother going forward? I know my family loves me and would give anything to help me out. They've been paying my rent, car loan, dr bills, etc. I only feel worse for this help, especially with this mindset.  Me dying here only saves them money and heartache of me not living up to my potential in my mind. Yeah, they'll be sad. But time will pass, they'll have less bills in the long run.

I was socially inept and so had a lot of trouble making friends. The \"friends\" I did have beat me up and abandoned me when a girl started to make fun of me, choosing to try to win points with her by mocking me further. I didn't feel like I could do better, however, and so never made a serious effort to find other people.At college, I couldn't tolerate being in such close proximity to so many people all the time. I couldn't study due to a lack of motivation and so ended up wasting my time. I struggled after that between joining the military and finding a job. In the end I decided the latter and became a software engineer.The company I work for gave me an opportunity: transfer to India for a year and lead a small team. I did just that, packing up all my things and leaving; after all, what did I have to lose? When I got there not much seemed to change; I was still alone, only in a new place with six different languages that were all but Martian to me. Through a friend, I had met a woman, an architect, and although we didn't talk much at first, the absence of that friend for a few days sparked something between us. The problem was that I still didn't fully trust her.As disgusting as it sounds, I just wanted to have sex with her. I loved the attention I was getting, and really did enjoy being around her, but the end goal was the same. Eventually she found out my game and we split for a period of a few days, in which time I found how much I really did care for her.Time passed and I struggled to get her to give me another chance. I knew I had done inexcusable things, things that I wouldn't forgive myself, but somehow, she did. She gave me a deal: I had to change the narcissistic parts of myself, the lines of thought that led me to deceive her, and then she would take me back.She told me of her own situation, something which she had not lied about but had not spoken about either. She is married to another man, the ceremony having passed only a few months after I arrived in the country. He was her best friend, but she didn't love him. Only a short while after finishing her Master's degree in England did her parents begin again hounding her to get married. They set up men for her, crazy religious Hindus, as her family is associated with, so her friend offered her a way out. He had feelings for her, and so on a chance she took his hand in marriage.She never felt anything more for him, telling me that they had only kissed once since they had been married before she knew that she couldn't love him. She loved me. And when she said that, and every time since, my heart has swooned. I have struggled to become a better person for her, to support her in any way that I can, but things are going sour.I was working illegally in the country, placed on a Business visa, allowing me only to go to meetings. In reality, I was working 9-5 some days, most days even later. I had to come back to the US while an Employment visa gets processed. My arrival was only weeks before today.The distance has taken a toll on her and I as we try to find time to talk to each other with a 12 hour difference. I stay up late most nights, usually into the early morning in order to have a short conversation with her. On weekends we can video chat, and when we do all those negative feelings wash away. When I can see her smile, I can't help but do the same. But recently I've seen something odd. I message her over FaceBook, and although she is online, she takes hours at a time to respond. When I ask why, she gets defensive. She tells me she loves me to my face but I feel like she's losing whatever feelings she had for me. She puts in no effort to talk to me when it's not convenient for her and tells me I'm not doing enough.When she told me she wanted to end it, I nearly through myself over a cliff (not quite literally yet). I felt angry, sad, confused; I couldn't imagine a life without her! I still can't. I can't fathom her in love with another man, one that I know has been abusive to her. When I think of her following tradition and having kids with a man who neglects and abuses her, a man who used to be her friend, with me being across the world, I don't see any hope for myself.Yes, I realize that there are lots of women in the world and thus there is a high probability for me to find somebody else that I would love equally. But I don't want that. I have the woman I love but she's slipping away. My future is bleak now.I have 10 days to get a rifle. In that buffer time I want to try to enjoy my time on this planet, to treat my parents and siblings well, to love and care for everybody I come in contact with. I want to see if I can find another purpose for living. Before, it was only cash and girls, but after experiencing the warm love of a woman, I can't be that shallow. After feeling that high, I can't live any lower. At the end of those ten days I will pick up the rifle and commit suicide by cop. I hope to see my last sunset on the hills beside my home. I hope everybody can understand.","426":"this time i am dead serious my mother and me got into a huge fight again i kept quiet but she prayed to god that i die and even gave me in writing when i asked

people on suicide watch atleast they are doing SOMETHING in their life but me i am doing absolutely NOTHING today my mom is on night shift and my grandpa has gone to my uncle's house i think i should kill myself","429":"I've been biding my time and soon it'll be time. More and more I've found myself just sitting alone and reflecting on my life, trying to raise my spirits with old memories of when I had it better. I have nothing. Decades of nothing. I wanted to comfort myself, but how could I when so much of life has been emptiness? I tried pretending instead. I pretended I'd gone on adventures I never participated in, with friends I'd never had. I pretended I'd been to a party where people knew my name and ladies all wanted to have my number. I pretended I had a pet hedgehog I named Spike Milligan. I pretended I had a girlfriend, who would tell me how her day went, and I would listen as I nodded-off to sleep by her side. I had dreams of walking through woods, learning to make things together, attending festivals in Europe and India together. My only happy memories are lies, and I spent them sotting alone wishing they would come true. I haven't got anyone else to miss me, and I'm tired of this torture. One day I might earn a raise, I would tell myself everyday. One day I might have something left over to buy myself something nice and teach myself a trade. I feel relief at the prospect of leaving. Even if by some divine intervention just one of those dreams of mine comes true, what good would it do when so much of the life I'd lived has been empty? I'm not the person to have nice things. They would be wasted on me. Give it to somebody who can appreciate it. I'm going soon, and I quite like the idea of making it as quiet as possible. Theres no need for a rope or pills, as I don't want to waste police time with the corpse of a nameless man. I'll find somewhere quiet, where I can hide in secret and spend my final days reflecting on my make-believe life. Nature should do the rest. At least by leaving this message, I'll have had somebody notice me long enough to day goodbye. Goodbye.","430":"**this post isn't complete. i'm too tired to finish it now. i'm sorry.**I'm terrible at these. I'm not sure what I hope to gain by writing this, but I think it's important. It'll be chronological.My friend is  henceforth J. J's parents are divorced. His father is emotionally abusive. J's current S.O. is henceforth B.    1. 2006-2007&gt;&gt;J's parents, after sixteen years of bitter marriage, finally give in to their deep hatred for each other and separate. J's father loses his engineering job and his mother, with an unusable medical degree from India, is forced to take long and sporadic hours at her job nursing.&gt;&gt;J technically lives with his mother, but his mother is never home. Often, she will leave before he wakes up and return from work after falling asleep. This leaves him with massive amounts of time alone and to himself. On one hand, he begins to teach himself things as a distraction and becomes a very proficient programmer as well as being highly skilled in other areas. On the other hand, this marks the beginning of his depression as he begins, for the first time, to hate himself.     2. February 2011&gt;&gt;J and his father go to a restaurant, which is a common occurrence. However, J's father decides that this will be the time to berate J for some reason. J has enough, so he walks out of the restaurant. He walks all the way to the nearest freeway bridge, looking over the edge with dark thoughts again. Eventually, he curls up at the base of the road and calls his father to take him home.&gt;&gt;This is the first time J has considered suicide.        3. September 2009&gt;&gt;J meets B, and he is instantly infatuated. He continues to be attracted to her for four years, and struggles continually with attempting to avoid and get over her.     4. June 2012&gt;&gt;J and his father are both having a bad day. Father is driving J to a school-related event (hours from home), but after some tension, kicks J out of the car at a restaurant. J walks for hours, and when he approaches a freeway bridge, he seriously considers jumping off. &gt;&gt;This is the second time J has come close to suicide.&gt;&gt;After some hours of walking, J arrives near his original destination. He'd injured his leg on the way there, and so he is brought to the hospital and the police are called. His father is *extremely* angry, and berates J further on the way home.    5. November 2012&gt;&gt;J decides after four years of pain that he will ask B out. He expects to be rejected, and for this rejection to be final. This will help him move on.&gt;&gt;B accepts.&gt;&gt;Thus begins their tumultuous relationship.     6. &gt;&gt;J decides after four years of pain that he will ask B out. He expects to be rejected, and for this rejection to be final. This will help him move on.","431":"I've thought about suicide for as long as I can remember, since I was 5 maybe...  I've never been able to come up with a good reason not to do it, and I keep turning back to it as an option.  I've been _very_ close several times, but honestly the fear of just \"vanishing\" has held me back.  I don't think I have that fear any longer.So first, I'm not really depressed.  I'm just, empty.  I have been for a long time.  I'm perfectly happy some days, while I'm doing something, then it all just resets an hour later and I have no emotion.I'm not a good person.  I'm a borderline psychopath in that I can't emphasize with anyone, about anything, and I have absolutely no moral boundaries.  I regularly have homicidal thoughts as well, the only reason I don't act on them is because of societal consequences.  I've raped a couple girls while they were passed out drunk, threatened to rape &amp; murder my most recent long-term ex, I've come dangerously close to severely hurting people, I've thrown some random guy through a window into a store, I've had sex with my dogs, I see escorts regularly, I've stolen tens of thousands of dollars of things, and most importantly I've hurt people that I care about for no real reason.  I've manipulated the hell out of people to get what I want, I have 8 ex girlfriends (well 1 ex wife and 7 ex girlfriends) that refuse to talk to me at all.  I have no real friends, at least from my perspective.  A bunch of people that call me a friend, but nobody I specifically want to be around for any length of time, or that I care if I see, ever.  I can lie through my teeth easily, to the point where I have passed a polygraph with flying colors to get government security clearance for a job (the company contracts with the government).  I regularly lie to everyone for no real reason, about the stupidest things, like where I went for lunch or what I did that day.  I can keep it all straight.I'm a genius, and I don't care.  I sailed through one of the best schools in the US, was accepted directly into a doctoral program after my BS degrees, which I didn't accept.  I've had numerous papers published, invented something that cause my school to freely pay off $250,000 in student loans, etc.  I'm now a software engineer, and although I'm amazingly good at my job, I have no motivation whatsoever to do it.  I can get hired in a moment at $150\/hr, but over the past few years I've tended to just take contracts, start them, lose motivation and stop working.  The client\/boss ends the contract or fires me for not showing up \/ not working, lather, rinse, repeat.  So I collect $20-$40,000, don't work for a while, do it again.  I burn through money at a ridiculous rate.I've tried everything I can think of.  I've been on various medications for depression, but the problem is that I'm not really depressed.  I've travelled, a lot, and don't really take pleasure in it any more.  It used to at least be interesting to me and now it's \"oh, look: another beach.  And this canyon in Kauai kinda looks like the Grand Canyon.  ok.\"I've been looking for a point for a long time.  I'm \"only\" 31, but I don't really see why I should live another 30-60 years in this state.  In a state of not caring, not wanting to do anything, just... existing.  The way I see it is this: I'm going to die at some point, and within say 40 years after I die, my death won't even be remembered, by anyone.  Even if I really hurt a few people when I kill myself, so what?  They'll be dead soon enough, and their memories and pain will no longer exist.  My life won't matter at all unless I do something important (the funny thing is I'm one of those people that could if I could actually care and get motivation to do so.  I have in the past done things that literally changed entire industries, and got loads of praise and fame for it), I just don't care enough.  But even then, I invented X, or started company Y.  So what?I don't see the point in going forward.  I also don't see the point in killing myself, but over the past 10 years, I've slowly been drifting to the point of ending everything.  Yes, I'm perfectly happy sometimes, but that happiness fades, for me usually very very quickly, into a void.  And other times I'm very depressed, sad, or hurt, and that lingers much longer.  The happiness doesn't make the rest worth it, even in times where the amount of time I'm happy significantly outweighs the amount of time that I'm sad.  It's gotten to the point where I don't want to deal with _any_ pain, even stupid things like being stuck in traffic or cutting my hand on something.Why am I writing this?  Because I want to see a value in something, in anything.  I've done loads of volunteer work, for years.  I've travelled.  I've had people that I've become very close and attached to, that I loved very much.  I'm very active, everything from biking to skiing to triathlons, I go climbing all the time, I guess my point is that I usually don't just sit at home.  But I no longer care about any of it.  And even when I did care, all I remember is caring about the challenge, or in some cases (like rock climbing) the fear, the exhilaration of being on the edge of a rock 1,000 ft above the ground.So the normal: \"talk to someone\" response, I have.  Many people.  I've talked to about a dozen psychologists\/psychiatrists, and usually end up getting bored and either messing with them (and consequentially eventually getting asked to leave), or in a couple cases where they were court mandated I just convinced them I was fine.  I've been very honest with a few of them, to which their advice ranged from meditation to anger management to group counseling to drugs to occupying my mind to a dozen other things.  Nothing changes my mindset.  I've been insanely honest with my last girlfriend (who is a psych major), she no longer speaks to me.My current plan is to sell everything I own, go to Thailand for a few months to go climbing mostly, bike through Burma and India, then move to Europe (I live in the US now) indefinitely.  Find somewhere to live and do... whatever.  I'm hoping that completely drowning myself in other cultures might give me another perspective, or ... I don't know, something.  I'm not sure I'll make it to any of that.  I bike over a bridge and stop, and stare at the edge.  I did it a few days ago long enough for someone to call a cop that walked 1 mile to me to see if I was ok.  I go skydiving solo (i.e. non-tandem for anyone that's done it) just to see if I'll pull the cord or not.  Or while rock climbing, I'll think of jumping off a belay ledge.  I've bought enough pills to kill a horse, never took any.  I've owned a gun (which is now somewhere at the bottom of the ocean), I've made several extremely high explosives with the plan to attach them to my head.  They're now at the bottom of a lake (or rather they were used to blow up a log in a lake)...So, I doubt I'll get anything of this, other than some hate mail for a few things that I've said, but it's worth a shot...","432":"My current workplace is undergoing a massive \"restructuring\" of sorts - where most of the positions will be either dissolved or moved to India. My girlfriend just received word that her position at her job has been discontinued, but she's being given the \"opportunity\" to choose a different one with more hours, and a greatly reduced rate of pay. I keep hearing how small business owners are \"job creators\" and \"economic contributors\" when the majority of them seem to feel that the mere act of hanging your shingle means that you get acres of cash with little effort or investiture. Most of them feel employing help is an inconvenience, and fewer still have any kind of foresight beyond what will line their pockets in the next quarter.I don't exactly have much faith in humanity - as far as I'm concerned the human race has only just barely evolved ourselves out of lesser simian forms and that we'd still rape and murder each other over a scrap of food.I have been looking for work elsewhere, but without much success. Either the position offered is SEVERELY underpaying (to the point where I would no longer be able to afford common niceties like rent and food) or all of my interviewing with the organization went to prove how much better qualified one of the other candidates is.I'm tired of being chided for holding a pessimistic attitude when it feels like I'm being continually shit on. I've been told that it's when we feel the most abandoned by the divine is when we are actually closest to it - and it's times like these when I feel like it's true, because I feel like I'm being singled out for punishment.Yes, I know the world gets shitty for everyone at certain times and I should be thankful for any kind of employment, even if it leaves me feeling like an abused whore at the end of the day. I'm told I should be grateful that I'm not a refugee in Darfur or living out on the street. I know I'm overlooking all of the myriad little miracles that supposedly help me continue my very existence on this glorious planet, and that life really isn't so bad and if I just chin up and make the best of what I have that things will prove to be a-okay.Well, those \"sunshine and rainbows\" platitudes don't pay the fucking bills. The knowledge that I was incredibly lucky to be born at this particular time and place doesn't impress the collectors on my student loans. The fact that my body is a miracle of biology capable of transforming food and oxygen into life, while staving off disease and being self-healing, doesn't fill my larder or keep electricity flowing to my abode.Feeling happy and optimistic about one's lot in life does fuck-all if you're surrounded by parasites and sociopaths who view you as a \"resource\" instead of a \"human being.\"The more I try to bring some kind of worth to my life, the more the world around me proves that it's not worth shit. I'd kill myself, but given my success rate at everything else currently, I'd probably fuck that up too.My girlfriend loves me and I love her. But I wish that was enough to survive on. The only way I can imagine things improving for either of us depends on a fundamental and miraculous change in the world we live in. It would mean that the world would actually reward hard work and effort; that it would recognize sacrifice; that people would think of the impact their actions have on others, instead of whatever short-term base need currently flits into their head. There is so little I have any effect or control over - and most of the major decisions that affect how I live are in the hands of other people (an employer, prospective or current, for example). Suicide feels like the only form of control I have left right now, and I'm too afraid to even exercise it - I've been proven to be inadequate, incompetent, and just plain unlucky in nearly every other aspect of my life - why would it be and different?I'm not asking for much, I just want to continue to live in a dwelling with the woman I love, and be able to support her as well as she supports me. That's all.But apparently it's too much to ask for.","433":"I'm exhausted , I really am, I'm so sick of it all......I'm a guy, im hairy, im ugly and I'm short I'm only 16, I'm from an indian backround with darkish skin ( thats considered a bad thing in terms of attractiveness in india and the ideology carries over here ) I don't get any girls , I'm pretty dumb with a big ego, I keep trying my whole life to fit in.....I can't I'm not one of them, but I was still want the experince no matter how much I bullshit myself....I just want a women, peers etc...I'm just sad overall I started doing weed to improve my social life and it has helped kind of....but I don't really want to do drugs to make friends.. I don't really know what I'm expecting from this post.....","434":"I have felt suicidal on and off for several years, but I've put it off by telling myself that things will get better eventually. I don't think they will anymore. Sadly, I wasted my life away feeling depressed and alone. Especially the past 6 years. It should have been so much better. I'm 24 years old now with no direction in life, and no motivation to improve. I think about suicide every day. This is long, so sorry about that. If you're interested, here is my story.My relationship with my parents growing up was not good. My father had a very bad temper and his verbal and at times physical abuse at an early age was traumatic to me. My mom was luckily there to intervene a lot of times, but she also has a lot of the same views as him which didn't gel with who I was as a teenager.They are both doctors, from India. There was a lot of pressure to perform well academically, get into a good college, and major in either medicine or engineering, something professional that would lead to a good paying, prestigious career. My father was obsessed about me doing well on the SAT exams, and didn't give me any choice in the matter of what to study in college or where I would go. He based this decision purely on what his sister-in-law (a HS guidance counselor) recommended.The main thing I was really interested in growing up was music. I loved the energy and excitement I got when listening to music, and started playing guitar when I was 12. I spent a lot of time teaching myself to play when I was growing up, and I got good at it, and felt that I could grow up to be really good at it. I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue, but when time came to talk about what I would do in college, he said \"absolutely not music\". He doesn't give any value to music and would belittle me about this thing that I cared so much about. \"How much money have you made playing guitar? You think you're so great?\" He really beat me down about it and made me feel worthless. Fine. I would go to college to study what he wanted me to study, engineering.  At least I would be away from him, right?My first year of college sucked. I was in a small, heavily monitored freshman dorm, surrounded by assholes who bullied me (who would do stuff like take a hat I was wearing, run off with it and light it on fire), and studying engineering, which really didn't appeal to me. I only had 1 friend who would regularly hang out with me. On my 19th birthday, in February, I was so depressed from all the bullshit these assholes were putting me through that I smoked pot in my room rather than going outside, and got in trouble for that. I knew there was a good chance I'd get in trouble, but I didn't care.I saw a therapist for a few times after that because I told the school I was depressed. And that was helpful. I ended up doing a lot better for the rest of the school year. Made good friends towards the end who also were into skateboarding, art, and music and generally seemed like the cool hippie kids I wanted to know the whole time. Things were looking up, I was going to live with a friend who was awesome, and finally be happy, right?Then during summer vacation, I had gotten accepted into another school closer to home, which I had applied to transfer into around the time that I got caught smoking weed. I gave it some thought (not enough though) and decided to transfer. Why? Too many bad memories. Thought I'd benefit from a fresh start. This is a major regret in retrospect. I lost a lot of really special friends that I never had a chance to have real solid friendships with. I think part of me wanted to leave because I thought they'd be happier without my awkward presence\u2026 which is sad to think about because I now know it would have been fine. They really did like and care about me.I started sophomore year at a new school. I changed my major from engineering to economics. I never enjoyed economics, but I thought I could get through it and it would be enough of a 'practical major' for my father. I don't even think I brought up studying music because I knew how he'd react, as he was already butthurt that I quit engineering. So it was a compromise for the sake of my father, again. I should have made a better switch than to fucking economics though, since I never wanted a cubicle job and I never cared about stocks or anything like that. I never met people in my classes that I got along with. I made friends through my initial living situation who remained my friends throughout college, but I always felt like an outsider. I was always the one calling someone else to hang out, never the other way around. Going to parties wasn't great because when asked \"what's your major?\" and then saying that it's economics and I don't like it doesn't make you a fun person to talk to. The interaction often ended there. Super lame. So I never fit in. I never had a good, fun, living situation in college, spent the last year alone. Never got laid at all the whole time in high school, college, or since then either. Never felt the warm embrace of a girl. Never loved by anyone.After college, I eventually got a shitty internship that lasted almost a year, mostly just entering data on a computer for $9\/hr. Living in a condo with my brother, paid for by my parents, in a part of the city that I never wanted to be in, away from my friends and surrounded by people that I can't relate to. I was in a band though, so that was good. I hung out with them a lot and for the first time I was putting the time and work into music that I wanted to, rather than just noodling alone in my room. It was fun.This past winter though, I decided I needed a change, the job was boring as ever and the band was slowing down\u2026 So I moved across the country to live\/work in the mountains. I had a great time there overall, snowboarding every chance I could. Had good friends and roommates. Didn't make much money though due to a slow winter\/lack of work and instead of keeping the adventure going, I came home in May.Things were initially good when I came back. One thing that was nice was that I finally looked like I wanted to, more or less. I've always been really thin, but I put on a little weight, and the face was looking good. Also, I finally had the nice long hair I always wanted to have growing up, instead of a 'bullshit phase' messy afro type thing I'd usually have\u2026 since my dad would always make me cut it off. About 2 weeks after I came back, I went to a party after some friends of mine played a concert and things seemed to be going well that night. There was even a cute girl who I think was interested in me. Unfortunately, I drank a lot that night. I don't remember exactly what caused it, it could have been a few different things, maybe overall sadness upon reflecting on my own college experience and\/or the need to go to sleep. Anyway, I got really upset and decided to leave the party. It was really childish. I got my longboard and tried to skate all the way home\u2026 several miles away in the middle of the night. Yes, I should have stayed\/taken a cab. Instead, I fell hard and hurt my face. It looked bad initially, deep cut below my eye and scrapes on my forehead, but It could have been much worse. I was a couple millimeters away from probably losing my eye. Now I have a small dark scar under my eyelash which I've come to hate, especially given how I got it. That event catapulted me into a really deep depression. I was planning on starting to work a restaurant job the next day, had to call that off. I stayed at home with my parents for 2 weeks while my face recovered.I came back to living with my brother and was getting more and more depressed. Thinking about suicide constantly while pacing around the room, barely eating, looking at the mirror. To the point where I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I wrote a letter to my parents basically telling them I'm close to ending my life and why I felt this way. My dad called the next night while I was at a friends house to yell at me\u2026 told me you're coming home tomorrow, and you're gonna cut your hair (of course). So the next day, I came home, my mom gave me a shitty haircut, my dad yelled at me some more, and my mom tried to comfort me. At this point I felt inconsolable. There is nothing that I felt would be worth it to live for. I got admitted into an inpatient psych ward for 5 days in June, then an outpatient program for a few weeks. I thought I was feeling better. I had a plan to go back to college to pursue music therapy and told the people at the program that, which they thought sounds good, but I don't really know if that's what I want to do....To be honest, I still feel like ending my life just as much as I did in the beginning of the summer. I've thought for years that I'd kill myself around this age.. I'm not doing anything productive these days. Can't find a job. Still barely eating. I'm addicted to masturbating, too. I sometimes waste hours a day doing that.  Seeing other people being happy makes me more depressed. My friends in college who are living exactly how I wanted to live. I could have thrived if I had that opportunity. I feel like every time I hang out with someone I say\/do something really dumb that I beat myself up over, especially since if I do kill myself, they'll inevitably be thinking\/talking about me and the stupid things I've said\/done. So many people have embarrassing stories about me. I feel embarrassed about how I've lived these last 6 years\u2026 this was supposed to have been the prime time of my life, what have I accomplished? My mother cares about me a great deal but after all that we've been through, I still feel the same- hopeless. I feel bad to keep putting her through this torture. My dad doesn't even speak to me directly anymore, he says \"he's your problem\" to my mom. He's a big reason in why I've ended up like this. If there's anyone that I'd be happy to hurt emotionally by killing myself, it's him.","435":"SQLwitch asked me to post here. Here is a copy of my original post :I am here because I have seen other posts where you guys have been extremely helpful to people.I am currently in the states while my brother was back home in India. He had some plans to startup a business and had been working really hard at it. I had called him yesterday to discuss his plans and ended up telling him it was too risky. He agrreed to give it up. Three hours later I missed a bunch of calls from him. After calling him back he started telling me how much he loved me. He was clearly drunk. He apologized for a bunch of things and asked me to tell him a good memory of us. He also asked why i didnt call him more often. I was busy driving so I said I'd call him in 5 mins. I did but he didn't answer any of my calls. I thought he went to sleep or something. This morning my parents called to come home ASAP. He committed suicide.I don't really know how to deal with this. I didn't even say I love you to him when I said I would call him back. I am currently at the airport on my way back.He was 20 years old.","436":"Maybe this won't seem like much to others.  From the outside, my life appears great.  I just finished graduate school and my university is offering me a great fellowship to convince me back for a PhD.  I have a couple friends who I love dearly and who love me back.  Despite not having a good homelife or family, I am lucky to have an older mentor who is like a parents to me, who, despite us having no blood relationship, has treated me with unconditional caring.And then there is Islam.  There is no reason to fuck with long stories and jjustifications about why.  I just, stopped believing, slowly.  And that has cost me everything.  My fiance left me over it, because my disbelief was too much to bear.   I also found out some things which made me mad, one of them being that he cheated on me recently before leaving.I forgave the cheating, and I was not mad about anything.  I know reddit hates religious people, but I understood him.  He wants a religious wife and that's fine because its his life.  I moved on, I got over wanting to die, and I convinced myself life would be ok.  I began applying for a bunch of PhD programs.  I made plans on where to go, I made plans on how to spend the next years of my life.  I had found some happiness.Then last night, at 4 am, he calls me.  He wants to be with me.  He begs me.  He is sorry for the cheating. That much I know he is sorry.  Fuck the people who say, once a cheater, always a cheater... this situation with his cheating is complicated, and, even though I sound like an idiot, I do believe his sorrow on this and I do forgive him. He cries on the phone and tells me he might kill himself.  Yes, you will all right this off as abusive or manipulative, but, can you honestly tell me you've never done anything in your life.  He tells me to his biggest shock that he's told his family about me.  How pathetic right?  5 years together, \"married\" in secret, and his family had no idea about me.  Seems werid to you, but, that's how Indians are.  No one in his entire family has had a love marriage.  He has 33 cousins and not one of them has done it.  He had been terrified of his family.   He said when he told his dad, he had to listen to his dad cry on the phone.  He has likely ruined his relationship with his parents which, although that doesn't seem like a huge deal to a lot of Americans, you can't fathom how important this relationship is to an Indian.  (I don't say that to say \"you Americans don't love your parents!\" so don't take it that way, I just mean, this dynamic in India is something that is hard to even explain)So he says his conditions.  If I am with him, I must wear the hijab again.  I have to want to learn Islam with him and try and get better.  He cried on the phone asking me why I don't want to try.  I love this man more than my life.  If only he understood what it is to loose faith.  How I wish he understood it.  I love this man, and would give him anything, and he would give me anything, and he loves me unconditionally, but religion tells me he is not allowed to be with an unbeliving woman.  And he can not go against religion.He kept calling asking me to give a decision if I am willing to work things out with him, finally he called me again tonight 3 am, I told him, I will tell you by the end of the day.Now there is another problem.  I mentioned my friend and my mentor.  They are important because all the Muslim friends have left when I stopped caring for Islam.  Only these two exsist and they are both Hindus.  I love and respect these two (my friend and mentor) so much.  They have no idea.   They dislike my fiance for many reasons, and my mentor in particular at this point hates him because he found out about the cheating.  If they find out I go back to my fiance, they will loose every respect for me and I don't think they can ever love or care for me after this.  This hurts more than I can describe.  Especially they were so proud I was on my own, being my own person, so happy at me. Even my fiance hates them.  I wish these three did not hate each other.  These three people I care so much about.No matter what I do someone is unhappy.  My fiance's life is destroyed if I leave him.  He doesn't understand my lack of faith.  No one understands it.  I want to go and try things with him but if I do my mentor and friend will loose all respect and hate me.  I stand to loose all people I care about.  Also if I chose not to go back, it is now on me.  At least before, when he broke up with me, I could live with it knowing it was not my decision, I was powerless to change it, so I accepted and moved on.  To be honest, I can not make the decision to throw out the memories, the love, I can not communicate the depths of our love.I made a decision while on the phone with him, that I might end it today.  Call me a coward, I am a coward.  I can not make this decision.  I can not be in this place.  The pain I have felt over these things I can not describe.  I can not face this and I don't want to.  I told him I wlil make a decision today but I am not sure I will return today.  Sorry this is not very readable.  I am so distraught."},"is_suicide":{"0":0,"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0,"21":0,"22":0,"23":0,"24":0,"25":0,"26":0,"27":0,"28":0,"29":0,"30":0,"31":0,"32":0,"33":0,"34":0,"35":0,"36":0,"37":0,"38":0,"39":0,"40":0,"41":0,"42":0,"43":0,"44":0,"45":0,"46":0,"47":0,"48":0,"49":0,"50":0,"51":0,"52":0,"53":0,"54":0,"55":0,"56":0,"57":0,"58":0,"59":0,"60":0,"61":0,"62":0,"63":0,"64":0,"65":0,"66":0,"67":0,"68":0,"69":0,"70":0,"71":0,"72":0,"73":0,"74":0,"75":0,"76":0,"77":0,"78":0,"79":0,"80":0,"81":0,"82":0,"83":0,"84":0,"85":0,"86":0,"87":0,"88":0,"89":0,"90":0,"91":0,"92":0,"93":0,"94":0,"95":0,"96":0,"97":0,"98":0,"99":0,"100":0,"101":0,"102":0,"103":0,"104":0,"105":0,"106":0,"107":0,"108":0,"109":0,"110":0,"111":0,"112":0,"113":0,"114":0,"115":0,"116":0,"117":0,"118":0,"119":0,"120":0,"121":0,"122":0,"123":0,"124":0,"125":0,"126":0,"127":0,"128":0,"129":0,"130":0,"131":0,"132":0,"133":0,"134":0,"135":0,"136":0,"137":0,"138":0,"139":0,"140":0,"141":0,"142":0,"143":0,"144":0,"145":0,"146":0,"147":0,"148":0,"149":0,"150":0,"151":0,"152":0,"153":0,"154":0,"155":0,"156":0,"157":0,"158":0,"159":0,"160":0,"161":0,"162":0,"163":0,"164":0,"165":0,"166":0,"167":0,"168":0,"169":0,"170":0,"171":0,"172":0,"173":0,"174":0,"175":0,"176":0,"177":0,"178":0,"179":0,"180":0,"181":0,"182":0,"183":0,"184":0,"185":0,"186":0,"187":0,"188":0,"189":0,"190":0,"191":0,"192":0,"193":0,"194":0,"195":0,"196":0,"197":0,"198":0,"199":0,"200":0,"201":0,"202":0,"203":0,"204":0,"205":0,"206":0,"207":0,"208":0,"209":0,"210":0,"211":0,"212":0,"213":0,"214":0,"215":0,"216":0,"217":0,"218":0,"219":0,"220":0,"221":0,"222":0,"223":0,"224":0,"225":0,"226":0,"227":0,"228":0,"229":0,"230":0,"231":0,"232":0,"233":0,"234":0,"235":0,"236":0,"237":1,"238":1,"239":1,"240":1,"241":1,"242":1,"243":1,"244":1,"245":1,"246":1,"247":1,"248":1,"249":1,"250":1,"251":1,"252":1,"253":1,"254":1,"255":1,"256":1,"257":1,"258":1,"259":1,"260":1,"261":1,"262":1,"263":1,"264":1,"265":1,"266":1,"267":1,"268":1,"269":1,"270":1,"271":1,"272":1,"273":1,"274":1,"275":1,"276":1,"277":1,"278":1,"279":1,"280":1,"281":1,"282":1,"283":1,"284":1,"285":1,"286":1,"287":1,"288":1,"289":1,"290":1,"291":1,"292":1,"293":1,"294":1,"295":1,"296":1,"297":1,"298":1,"299":1,"300":1,"301":1,"302":1,"303":1,"304":1,"305":1,"306":1,"307":1,"308":1,"309":1,"310":1,"311":1,"312":1,"313":1,"314":1,"315":1,"316":1,"317":1,"318":1,"319":1,"320":1,"321":1,"322":1,"323":1,"324":1,"325":1,"326":1,"327":1,"328":1,"329":1,"330":1,"331":1,"332":1,"333":1,"334":1,"335":1,"336":1,"337":1,"338":1,"339":1,"340":1,"341":1,"342":1,"343":1,"344":1,"345":1,"346":1,"347":1,"348":1,"349":1,"350":1,"351":1,"352":1,"353":1,"354":1,"355":1,"356":1,"357":1,"358":1,"359":1,"360":1,"361":1,"362":1,"363":1,"364":1,"365":1,"366":1,"367":1,"368":1,"369":1,"370":1,"371":1,"372":1,"373":1,"374":1,"375":1,"376":1,"377":1,"378":1,"379":1,"380":1,"381":1,"382":1,"383":1,"384":1,"385":1,"386":1,"387":1,"388":1,"389":1,"390":1,"391":1,"392":1,"393":1,"394":1,"395":1,"396":1,"397":1,"398":1,"399":1,"400":1,"401":1,"402":1,"403":1,"404":1,"405":1,"406":1,"407":1,"408":1,"409":1,"410":1,"411":1,"412":1,"413":1,"414":1,"415":1,"416":1,"417":1,"418":1,"419":1,"420":1,"421":1,"422":1,"423":1,"424":1,"425":1,"426":1,"427":1,"428":1,"429":1,"430":1,"431":1,"432":1,"433":1,"434":1,"435":1,"436":1},"title_clean":{"0":"idc
